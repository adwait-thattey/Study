Data Models:

Data abstraction generally refers to the suppression of details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of the essential features for an improved understanding of data.
Characterstics of database: support abstraction

A data model—a collection of concepts that
can be used to describe the structure of a database—provides the necessary means
to achieve this abstraction.2 By structure of a database we mean the data types, rela-
tionships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data models also includeset of basic operations for specifying retrievals and updates on the database.

dynamic aspect or
behavior of a database application. This allows the database designer to specify a set
of valid user-defined operations that are allowed on the database objects.3 An
example of a user-defined operation could be COMPUTE_GPA, which can be
applied to a STUDENT object.


generic operations to insert,
delete, modify, or retrieve any kind of object are often included in the basic data
model operations.

For example, object-relational models (see Chapter 12) extend the basic
relational model to include such concepts, among others. In the basic relational data
model, there is a provision to attach behavior to the relations in the form of persis-
tent stored modules, popularly known as stored procedures (see Chapter 10).
