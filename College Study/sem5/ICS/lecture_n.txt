    RIsk = f((Vulnerability,Threat,COnsequences)/COntrols)
    
    VULNERABILITY: weakness in code/hardware
    threat: chance that someone could exploit thye vulnerability
    
    RIsk is the likelihood of a threat source exploiting the Vulnerability
    
    COntrol: A countermeasure that is put into place to reduce risk
    
    
Quantitative Analysis
    Terms:
        Exposure factor: %loss organization would suffer if risk materializes
        SIngle loss expectancy: cost associated with single ralized risk
        Annualized rate of occurance
        Annualized loss expectancy
    
    How:
        assign asset value to elements of risk assesment
        quantify all costs( asset value, impact , threat frequency, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard costs etc)
        
        Assign Asset value -> Calculate EF -
        > calculate SLE -> Asses Rate  ->.. -> analyze
        
        
    Example:
        asset value of wareourse = 150k
        if fire occurs: 25% is lost (EF)
        therefore SLE = 150k * 25% = 37.5k
        
        ALE = SLE*Annualized rate of occurance 
        Assume ARO = 0.1 (once in 10 years)
        
        therefore company can spend 37.5k * 0.1 = 3.75k
        SO the company can spend less than 3.75k per year to protect the asset
        
Qualitative ANalysis:
    Based only on experiance of individual
    No numerical value
    Rank serioness based on opinions
    
    
    Qualify likelihood based on risk and consequence
    Example:
        management distributes scenerio to 5 teams/people.
        They rank severity from 1 to 5
        Based on compiled results, management decides whether to purchase firewall
    
    Policy: high level statement
    process: 
    
    COntrols:
        Admistrative controls
    Defence in depth: Mechanism of applying controls in different layers.
    
    
Standards:
    ISO
    
    COntents of ISO 27001 Standards
        -Asset management
        - Access control
        - Operations security
        - Info security policies

        - Physical and environmental security
        - HR security etc.
        
        
    Plan Do Chk Act
    Plan:
        establish context
        assess risk
        develop Risk treatment plan
        Accept risk
        
    
        establish the ISMS
        define ISMS policies
        Identify key risks
    DO:
    
        implement RTP
    formulate risk treatment plan
