Abin Sur was the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. His ship crash-landed just outside Metropolis, severely wounding the Lantern. In his dying moments, he sent his Ring to seek a replacement - which became Kyle Rayner. Sinestro was hot on Abin Sur's heels, hoping to obtain his Power Battery, but he found only Superman.
