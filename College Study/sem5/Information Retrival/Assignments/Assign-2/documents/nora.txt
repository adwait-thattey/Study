Nora Thompson is the wife of Henry Allen and mother to Barry Allen, who eventually grew up to become the Flash. Her other child Malcolm Thawne was falsely pronounced stillborn and given to another family, growing up to become Cobalt Blue. Her entire history was changed when Professor Zoom went back in time to ruin Barry Allen's life during Rebirth. Instead of living to watch her son become a hero, she was murdered and her husband framed for the crime. Nora Allen was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, first appearing in The Flash #126. (1962)
