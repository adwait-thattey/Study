Aquaman, also known as Arthur Curry and Orin, is a superhero and the ruler of the seas. As the king of Atlantis and other undersea territories, he technically controls most of the planet. His abilities include super-strength, durability, super-speed, staying underwater indefinitely, and telepathy, which he uses to communicate with sea-life. His aquatic nature means he requires water regularly at the risk of dehydration, although he is perfectly capable of staying on land for extended periods. The Aquaman Family also includes his wife Mera and his side-kicks Aqualad and Aquagirl, along with a number of others, fighting together against villains. He is also a founding member of the Justice League of America. Arthur Joseph Curry was his successor after the original died, and had his own adventures for several years, until Orin was resurrected during Blackest Night and reclaimed his title. Aquaman was created by Mort Weisinger and Paul Norris, first appearing in More Fun Comics #73. (1941)
