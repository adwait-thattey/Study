 To the casual observer, the various names an  intrepid traveler will encounter throughout Alagaësia might seem but a random  collection of labels with no inherent integrity, culture, or history. However,  as with any land that has been repeatedly colonized by different cultures—and  in this case, different races—Alagaësia quickly accumulated layers of names  from the elves, dwarves, humans, and even Urgals. Thus, we can have Palancar  Valley (a human name), the Anora River and Ristvak’baen (elven names), and  Utgard Mountain (a dwarf name) all within a few square miles of each other.
 While this is of great historical interest,  practically it often leads to confusion as to the correct pronunciation.  Unfortunately, there are no set rules for the neophyte. Each name must be  learned upon its own terms, unless you can immediately place its language of  origin. The matter grows even more confusing when you realize that in many  places the spelling and pronunciation of foreign words were altered by the  resident population to conform to their own language. The Anora River is a  prime example. Originallyanora was spelledäenora, which meansbroad  in the ancient language. In their writings, the humans simplified the word toanora,  and this, combined with a vowel shift whereinäe (ay-eh) was said as the  easiera (uh), created the name as it appears in Eragon’s time.
 To spare readers as much difficulty as  possible, the following list is provided, with the understanding that these are  only rough guidelines to the actual pronunciation. The enthusiast is encouraged  to study the source languages in order to master their true intricacies.
