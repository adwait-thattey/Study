Wing,</i> propelling the ship high in the air. There it teetered on the 
precipitous crest of a foam-capped swell before pitching forward and racing 
down the face of the wave into the black trough below. Billows of stinging mist 
drove through the frigid air as the wind groaned and howled like a monstrous 
spirit.<p/></span></p>

waist of the ship and retched over the gunwale; nothing came up but sour bile. 
He had prided himself that his stomach never bothered him while on Clovis’s 
barges, but the storm they raced before was so violent that even Uthar’s 
men—seasoned tars each and every one—had difficulty keeping their whisky down.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10078"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>It felt like a boulder of ice clouted Roran 
between the shoulder blades as a wave struck the ship crossways, drenching the 
deck before draining through the scuppers and pouring back into the frothing, 
furrowed, furious ocean from whence it came. Roran wiped the salty water from 
his eyes with fingers as clumsy as frozen lumps of wood, and squinted toward 
the inky horizon to the aft.<p/></span></p>

pursued them ever since they passed the Iron Cliffs and rounded what Jeod 
dubbed Edur Carthungavë and Uthar identified as Rathbar’s Spur. “The tailbone 
of the Spine, that’s what it be,” Uthar said, grinning. The sloops were faster 
than the<i>Dragon Wing,</i> weighed down with villagers as it was, and had 
quickly gained upon the merchant ship until they were close enough to exchange 
volleys of arrows. Worst of all, it seemed that the lead sloop carried a 
magician, for its arrows were uncannily accurate, splitting ropes, destroying 
ballistae, and clogging the blocks. From their attacks, Roran deduced that the 
Empire no longer cared about capturing him and only wanted to stop him from 
finding sanctuary with the Varden. He had just been preparing the villagers to 
repel boarding parties when the clouds above ripened to a bruised purple, heavy 
with rain, and a ravening tempest blew in from the northwest. At the present, 
Uthar had the<i>Dragon Wing</i> tacked crossways to the wind, heading toward the 
Southern Isles, where he hoped to elude the sloops among the shoals and coves 
of Beirland.<p/></span></p>

between two bulbous thunderheads, and the world became a tableau of pale marble 
before darkness reigned once more. Every blinding flash imprinted a motionless 
scene upon Roran’s eyes that lingered, pulsing, long after the brazen bolts 
vanished.<p/></span></p>

and Roran saw—as if in a series of monochrome paintings—the mizzen topmast 
twist, crack, and topple into the thrashing sea, port amidships. Grabbing a 
lifeline, Roran pulled himself to the quarterdeck and, in unison with Bonden, 
hacked through the cables that still connected the topmast to the<i>Dragon Wing</i> 
and dragged the stern low in the water. The ropes writhed like snakes as they 
were cut.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10092"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The storm lasted two full days and broke 
during the wee hours of the night. The following morning brought with it a pale 
green dawn, clear skies, and three black sails riding the northern horizon. To 
the southwest, the hazy outline of Beirland lay underneath a shelf of clouds 
gathered about the ridged mountain that dominated the island.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10093"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10094"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran, Jeod, and Uthar met in a small fore 
cabin—since the captain’s stateroom was given over to the infirm—where Uthar 
unrolled sea charts on the table and tapped a point above Beirland. “This’d be 
where we are now,” he said. He reached for a larger map of Alagaësia’s 
coastline and tapped the mouth of the Jiet River. “An’ this’d be our 
destination, since food won’t last us to Reavstone. How we get there, though, 
without being overtaken is beyond me. Without our mizzen topgallant, those 
accursed sloops will catch us by noon tomorrow, evening if we manage the sails 
well.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10098"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Uthar shrugged. “We could, provided we had a 
proper ship’s carpenter among us. Seeing as we don’t, I’d rather not let 
inexperienced hands mount a spar, only to have it crash down on deck and 
perhaps injure somebody.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10100"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran said, “If it weren’t for the magician or 
magicians, I’d say we should stand and fight, since we far outnumber the crews 
of the sloops. As it is, I’m chary of battle. It seems unlikely that we could 
prevail, considering how many ships sent to help the Varden have disappeared.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10101"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10102"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Grunting, Uthar drew a circle around their 
current position. “This’d be how far we can sail by tomorrow evening, assuming 
the wind stays with us. We could make landfall somewhere on Beirland or Nía if 
we wanted, but I can’t see how that’d help us. We’d be trapped. The soldiers on 
those sloops or the Ra’zac or Galbatorix himself could hunt us at his leisure.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10104"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran scowled as he considered their options;

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10106"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>For several minutes, the cabin was silent 
except for the slap of waves against the hull. Then Jeod placed his finger on 
the map between Beirland and Nía, looked at Uthar, and asked, “What about the 
Boar’s Eye?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10107"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

actually blanched. “I’d not risk that, Master Jeod, not on my life. I’d rather 
face the sloops an’ die in the open sea than go to that doomed place. There has 
consumed twice as many ships as in Galbatorix’s fleet.”<p/></span></p>

admitted, “Aye. But the Eye is so wide, it requires the most precise timing to 
cross without being destroyed. We’d be hard-pressed to accomplish that with the 
sloops near on our tail.”<p/></span></p>

could time it right, the sloops would be wrecked or—if their nerve failed 
them—forced to circumvent Nía. It would give us time to find a place to hide 
along Beirland.”<p/></span></p>

What I propose is dangerous, I admit, but no more than fleeing Teirm was. Or do 
you doubt your ability to sail the gap? Are you not man enough to do it?”<p/></span></p>

the Eye far exceeds the strength of men; it puts to shame our biggest ships, 
our grandest buildings, an’ anything else you’d care to name. Tempting it would 
be like trying to outrun an avalanche; you might succeed, but then you just as

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10130"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>In a milder tone, Jeod said, “It’s a 
whirlpool, Roran. The Eye forms as the result of tidal currents that collide 
between Beirland and Nía. When the tide waxes, the Eye rotates north to west. 
When the tide wanes, it rotates north to east.”<p/></span></p>

“is the size of the vortex. On average, the center of the Eye is a league in 
diameter, while the arms of the pool can be anywhere from ten to fifteen miles 
across. Ships unlucky enough to be snared by the Eye are borne down to the

a little while longer.<p/></span></p>

villagers worked to tidy up the ship after the storm and prepare for the ordeal 
that was to come. Their work ended at nightfall, when they extinguished every 
light on board in an attempt to confuse their pursuers as to the<i>Dragon Wing</i> 
’s heading. The ruse succeeded in part, for when the sun rose, Roran saw that 
the sloops had fallen back to the northwest another mile or so, though they 
soon made up the lost distance.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10169"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Late that morning, Roran climbed the mainmast 
and pulled himself up into the crow’s nest a hundred and thirty feet above the 
deck, so high that the men below appeared no larger than his little finger. The 
water and sky seemed to rock perilously about him as the<i>Dragon Wing</i> 
heeled from side to side.<p/></span></p>

him, Roran put it to his eye and adjusted it until the sloops came into focus 
not four miles astern and approaching faster than he would have liked.<i>They 
must have realized what we intend to do,</i> he thought. Sweeping the glass 
around, he searched the ocean for any sign of the Boar’s Eye. He stopped as he 
descried a great disk of foam the size of an island, gyrating from north to 
east.<i>We’re late,</i> he thought, a pit in his stomach. High tide had already 
passed and the Boar’s Eye was gathering in speed and strength as the ocean 
withdrew from land. Roran trained the glass over the edge of the crow’s nest 
and saw that the knotted rope Uthar had tied to the starboard side of the 
stern—to detect when they entered the pull of the whirlpool—now floated 
alongside the<i>Dragon Wing</i> instead of trailing behind as was usual. The 
one thing in their favor was that they were sailing with the Eye’s current and 
not against it. If it had been the other way around, they would have had no 
choice but to wait until the tide turned.<p/></span></p>

villagers to man the oars. A moment later, the<i>Dragon Wing</i> sprouted two 
rows of poles along each side, making the ship look like nothing more than a 
giant water strider. At the beat of an ox-hide drum, accompanied by Bonden’s 
rhythmic chant as he set the tempo, the oars arched forward, dipped into the 
sea of green, and swept back across the surface of the water, leaving white 
streaks of bubbles in their wake. The<i>Dragon Wing</i> accelerated quickly, 
now moving faster than the sloops, which were still outside the Eye’s 
influence.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10175"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran watched with horrified fascination the 
play that unfolded around him. The essential plot element, the crux upon which 
the outcome depended, was time. Though they were late, was the<i>Dragon Wing,</i> 
with its oars and sails combined, fast enough to traverse the Eye? And could 
the sloops—which had deployed their own oars now—narrow the gap between them 
and the<i>Dragon Wing</i> enough to ensure their own survival? He could not 
tell. The pounding drum measured out the minutes; Roran was acutely aware of 
each moment as it trickled by.<p/></span></p>

basket. Baldor handed Roran a biscuit and a dried apple and said, “Thought you 
might like some lunch.” With a nod of thanks, Roran tore into the biscuit and 
resumed gazing through the spyglass. When Baldor asked, “Can you see the Eye?” 
Roran passed him the glass and concentrated on eating.<p/></span></p>

increased the speed of its revolutions until it spun like a top. The water 
around the foam bulged and began to rise, while the foam itself sank from view 
into the bottom of a gigantic pit that continued to deepen and enlarge. The air 
over the vortex filled with a cyclone of twisting mist, and from the ebony 
throat of the abyss came a tortured howl like the cries of an injured wolf.<p/></span></p>

himself, making sure that, if needed, he could reach his belt knife to cut 
himself free. Anxiety filled him as he surveyed the situation. The<i>Dragon 
Wing</i> was but a mile past the median of the Eye, the sloops were but two 
miles behind her, and the Eye itself was quickly building toward its full fury. 
Worse, disrupted by the whirlpool, the wind sputtered and gasped, blowing first 
from one direction and then the other. The sails billowed for a moment, then 
fell slack, then filled again as the confused wind swirled about the ship.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10193"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The gaping center of the Boar’s Eye was now 
almost nine and a half miles in circumference, and how many fathoms deep no one 
could say, except for those who had been trapped within it. The sides of the 
Eye slanted inward at a forty-five-degree angle; they were striated with 
shallow grooves, like wet clay being molded on a potter’s wheel. The bass howl 
grew louder, until it seemed to Roran that the entire world must crumble to 
pieces from the intensity of the vibrations. A glorious rainbow emerged from 
the mist over the whirling chasm.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10194"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10195"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The current moved faster than ever, driving 
the<i>Dragon Wing</i> at a breakneck pace as it whipped around the rim of the 
whirlpool and making it more and more unlikely that the ship could break free 
at the Eye’s southern edge. So prodigious was her velocity, the<i>Dragon Wing</i> 
tilted far to the starboard, suspending Roran out over the rushing water.<p/></span></p>

sloops continued to gain on her. The enemy ships sailed abreast less than a 
mile away, their oars moving in perfect accord, two fins of water flying from 
each prow as they plowed the ocean. Roran could not help but admire the sight.<p/></span></p>

had no need of it now. The sloops were close enough for the naked eye, while 
the whirlpool was increasingly obscured by the clouds of white vapor thrown off 
the lip of the funnel. As it was pulled into the deep, the vapor formed a 
spiral lens over the gulf, mimicking the whirlpool’s appearance.<p/></span></p>

diverging from the current in Uthar’s bid for the open sea. The keel chattered 
across the puckered water, and the ship’s speed dropped in half as the<i>Dragon 
Wing</i> fought the deadly embrace of the Boar’s Eye. A shudder ran up the 
mast, jarring Roran’s teeth, and the crow’s nest swung in the new direction, 
making him giddy with vertigo.<p/></span></p>

slow. He slashed off his bindings and—with reckless disregard for his own 
safety—swung himself over the edge of the basket, grabbed the ropes underneath, 
and shinnied down the rigging so quickly that he lost his grip once and fell 
several feet before he could catch himself. He jumped to the deck, ran to the 
fore hatchway, and descended to the first bank of oars, where he joined Baldor 
and Albriech on an oak pole.<p/></span></p>

of their own desperate breathing, the frenzied beat of the drum, Bonden’s 
hoarse shouts, and the roar of the Boar’s Eye. Roran could feel the mighty 
whirlpool resisting with every stroke of the oar.<p/></span></p>

Wing</i> from coming to a virtual standstill.<i>We’re not going to make it,</i> 
thought Roran. His back and legs burned from the exertion. His lungs stabbed. 
Between the drumbeats, he heard Uthar ordering the hands above deck to trim the 
sails to take full advantage of the fickle wind.<p/></span></p>

surrendered their oar to Thane and Ridley, then lay in the middle of the aisle, 
their limbs trembling. Less than a minute later, someone else collapsed farther 
down the gallery and was immediately replaced by Birgit and another woman.<p/></span></p>

in the murky, smoky room, first pushing, then pulling, doing his best to ignore 
the pain mounting within his body. His neck ached from hunching underneath the 
low ceiling. The dark wood of the pole was streaked with blood where his skin 
had blistered and torn. He ripped off his shirt—dropping the spyglass to the 
floor—wrapped the cloth around the oar, and continued rowing.<p/></span></p>

the ladder, swaying with the motion of the ship and often slumping against the

the fresh air, then staggered aft to the helm, his legs threatening to cramp

the four ships remained unchanged. Then he sensed a shift in the<i>Dragon Wing</i> 
’s speed, as if the ship had crossed some crucial point and the forces 
restraining her had diminished. It was a subtle difference and amounted to 
little more than a few additional feet per minute—but it was enough that the 
distance between the<i>Dragon Wing</i> and the sloops began to increase. With 
every stroke of the oars, the<i>Dragon Wing</i> gained momentum.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10237"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Unsheathing his belt knife, Roran set to work 
excising a dollop of green fire from the boards by his feet. Several tense 
minutes elapsed before the unnatural blazes were removed and it became clear 
that the conflagrations would not spread to the rest of the ship.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10239"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Once the cry of “All clear!” was sounded, 
Uthar relaxed his grip on the steering wheel. “If that was the best their 
magician can do, then I’d say we have nothing more to fear of him.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10240"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10241"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“We’re going to get out of the Eye, aren’t 
we?” asked Roran, eager to confirm his hope.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10243"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Uthar squared his shoulders and flashed a 
quick grin, both proud and disbelieving. “Not quite this cycle, but we’ll be 
close. We won’t make real progress away from that gaping monster until the tide 
slacks off. Go tell Bonden to lower the tempo a bit; I don’t want them fainting 
at the oars if’n I can help it.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10245"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>And so it was. Roran took another shift rowing 
and, by the time he returned to the deck, the whirlpool was subsiding. The 
vortex’s ghastly howl faded into the usual noise of the wind; the water assumed 
a calm, flat quality that betrayed no hint of the habitual violence visited 
upon that location; and the contorted fog that had writhed above the abyss melted 
under the warm rays of the sun, leaving the air as clear as oiled glass. Of the 
Boar’s Eye itself—as Roran saw when he retrieved the spyglass from among the 
rowers—nothing remained but the selfsame disk of yellow foam rotating upon the 
water.<p/></span></p>

could discern, just barely, three broken masts and a black sail floating round 
and round and round in an endless circle. But it might have been his 
imagination.<p/></span></p>

her swollen belly. In a small voice, she said, “We were lucky, Roran, more 
lucky than we had reason to expect.”<p/></span></p>
