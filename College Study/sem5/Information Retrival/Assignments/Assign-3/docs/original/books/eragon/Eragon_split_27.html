<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1865"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_127">E</span><span class="calibre_class_4">ragon woke from 
his nap to a golden sunset. Red and orange beams of light streamed into the 
room and fell across the bed. They warmed his back pleasantly, making him 
reluctant to move. He dozed, but the sunlight crept off him, and he grew cold. 
The sun sank below the horizon, lighting the sea and sky with color.<i>Almost 
time!</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1866"><span class="calibre_class_4">He slung his bow 
and quiver on his back, but left Zar’roc in the room; the sword would only slow 
him, and he was averse to using it. If he had to disable someone, he could use 
magic or an arrow. He pulled his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1867"><span class="calibre_class_4">He waited 
nervously in his room until the light faded. Then he entered the hallway and 
shrugged so the quiver settled comfortably across his back. Brom joined him, 
carrying his sword and staff.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1868"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jeod, dressed in 
a black doublet and hose, was waiting for them outside. From his waist swung an 
elegant rapier and a leather pouch. Brom eyed the rapier and observed, “That 
toad sticker is too thin for any real fighting. What will you do if someone 
comes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1869"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Be realistic,” 
said Jeod. “None of the guards has a flamberge. Besides, this<i>toad sticker</i> 
is faster than a broadsword.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1870"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom shrugged. 
“It’s your neck.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1871"><span class="calibre_class_4">They walked 
casually along the street, avoiding watchmen and soldiers. Eragon was tense and 
his heart pounded. As they passed Angela’s shop, a flash of movement on the 
roof caught his attention, but he saw no one. His palm tingled. He looked at 
the roof again, but it was still empty.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1872"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom led them 
along Teirm’s outer wall. By the time they reached the castle, the sky was 
black. The sealed walls of the fortress made Eragon shiver. He would hate to be 
imprisoned there. Jeod silently took the lead and strode up to the gates, 
trying to look at ease. He pounded on the gate and waited.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1873"><span class="calibre_class_4">A small grille 
slid open and a surly guard peered out. “Ya?” he grunted shortly. Eragon could 
smell rum on his breath.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1874"><span class="calibre_class_4">“We need to get 
in,” said Jeod.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1875"><span class="calibre_class_4">The guard peered 
at Jeod closer. “Wha’ for?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1876"><span class="calibre_class_4">“The boy here 
left something very valuable in my office. We have to retrieve it immediately.” 
Eragon hung his head, shamefaced.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1877"><span class="calibre_class_4">The guard 
frowned, clearly impatient to get back to his bottle. “Ah, wha’ever,” he said, 
swinging his arm. “Jus’ make sure ’n give ’im a good beating f’r me.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1878"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’ll do that,” 
assured Jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate. They entered 
the keep, then Brom handed the guard a few coins.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1879"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Thank’ee,” 
mumbled the man, tottering away. As soon as he was gone, Eragon pulled his bow 
from its tube and strung it. Jeod quickly let them into the main part of the 
castle. They hurried toward their destination, listening carefully for any 
soldiers on patrol. At the records room, Brom tried the door. It was locked. He 
put his hand against the door and muttered a word that Eragon did not 
recognize. It swung open with a faint click. Brom grabbed a torch from the wall, 
and they darted inside, closing the door quietly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1880"><span class="calibre_class_4">The squat room 
was filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls. A barred window was set 
in the far wall. Jeod threaded his way between the racks, running his eyes over 
the scrolls. He halted at the back of the room. “Over here,” he said. “These 
are the shipping records for the past five years. You can tell the date by the 
wax seals on the corner.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1881"><span class="calibre_class_4">“So what do we 
do now?” asked Eragon, pleased that they had made it so far without being 
discovered.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1882"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Start at the 
top and work down,” said Jeod. “Some scrolls only deal with taxes. You can 
ignore those. Look for anything that mentions Seithr oil.” He took a length of 
parchment from his pouch and stretched it out on the floor, then set a bottle 
of ink and a quill pen next to it. “So we can keep track of whatever we find,” 
he explained.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1883"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom scooped an 
armful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor. He sat 
and unrolled the first one. Eragon joined him, positioning himself so he could 
see the door. The tedious work was especially difficult for him, as the cramped 
script on the scrolls was different from the printing Brom had taught him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1884"><span class="calibre_class_4">By looking only 
for the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas, they winnowed out 
many of the scrolls. Even so, they moved down the rack slowly, recording each 
shipment of Seithr oil as they located it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1885"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was quiet 
outside the room, except for the occasional watchman. Suddenly, Eragon’s neck 
prickled. He tried to keep working, but the uneasy feeling remained. Irritated, 
he looked up and jerked with surprise—a small boy crouched on the windowsill. 
His eyes were slanted, and a sprig of holly was woven into his shaggy black 
hair.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1886"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Do you need 
help?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">asked 
a voice in Eragon’s head. His eyes widened with shock. It sounded like 
Solembum.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1887"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Is that you?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he asked 
incredulously.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1888"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Am I someone 
else?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1889"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon gulped 
and concentrated on his scroll<i>. If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1890"><span class="calibre_class_4">The boy smiled 
slightly, revealing pointed teeth.<i>What I look like doesn’t change who I am. 
You don’t think I’m called a werecat for nothing, do you?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1891"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">What are you 
doing here?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
asked.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1892"><span class="calibre_class_4">The werecat 
tilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an answer.<i>That 
depends on what you are doing here. If you are reading those scrolls for 
entertainment, then I suppose there isn’t any reason for my visit. But if what 
you are doing is unlawful and you don’t want to be discovered, I might be here 
to warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you 
and that this second official of the Empire has sent soldiers to search for 
you.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1893"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Thank you for 
telling me,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said 
Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1894"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Told you 
something, did I? I suppose I did. And I suggest you make use of it.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1895"><span class="calibre_class_4">The boy stood 
and tossed back his wild hair. Eragon asked quickly,<i>What did you mean last 
time about the tree and the vault?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1896"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Exactly what I 
said.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1897"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon tried to 
ask more, but the werecat vanished through the window. He announced abruptly, 
“There are soldiers looking for us.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1898"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How do you 
know?” asked Brom sharply.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1899"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I listened in 
on the guard. His replacement just sent men to search for us. We have to get 
out of here. They’ve probably already discovered that Jeod’s office is empty.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1900"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Are you sure?” 
asked Jeod.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1901"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes!” said 
Eragon impatiently. “They’re on their way.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1902"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom snatched 
another scroll from the rack. “No matter. We have to finish this now!” They 
worked furiously for the next minute, scanning the records as fast as they 
could. As the last scroll was finished, Brom threw it back onto the rack, and 
Jeod jammed his parchment, ink, and pen into his pouch. Eragon grabbed the 
torch.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1903"><span class="calibre_class_4">They raced from 
the room and shut the door, but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of 
soldiers’ boots at the end of the hall. They turned to leave, but Brom hissed 
furiously, “Damnation! It’s not locked.” He put his hand against the door. The 
lock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers came into view.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1904"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Hey! Get away 
from that door!” shouted one of them. Brom stepped back, assuming a surprised 
expression. The three men marched up to them. The tallest one demanded, “Why 
are you trying to get into the records?” Eragon gripped his bow tighter and 
prepared to run.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1905"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’m afraid we 
lost our way.” The strain was evident in Jeod’s voice. A drop of sweat rolled 
down his neck.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1906"><span class="calibre_class_4">The soldier glared 
at them suspiciously. “Check inside the room,” he ordered one of his men.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1907"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon held his 
breath as the soldier stepped up to the door, tried to open it, then pounded on 
it with his mailed fist. “It’s locked, sir.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1908"><span class="calibre_class_4">The leader 
scratched his chin. “Ar’right, then. I don’t know what you were up to, but as 
long as the door’s locked, I guess you’re free to go. Come on.” The soldiers 
surrounded them and marched them back to the keep.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1909"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I can’t believe 
it,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">thought 
Eragon.<i>They’re helping us get away!</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1910"><span class="calibre_class_4">At the main 
gates, the soldier pointed and said, “Now, you walk through those and don’t try 
anything. We’ll be watching. If you have to come back, wait until morning.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1911"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Of course,” 
promised Jeod.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1912"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon could 
feel the guards’ eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the 
castle. The moment that the gates closed behind them, a triumphant grin 
stretched across his face, and he jumped into the air. Brom shot him a 
cautioning look and growled, “Walk back to the house normally. You can 
celebrate there.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1913"><span class="calibre_class_4">Chastised, 
Eragon adopted a staid demeanor, but inside he still bubbled with energy. Once 
they had hurried back to the house and into the study, Eragon exclaimed, “We 
did it!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1914"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes, but now we 
have to figure out if it was worth the trouble,” said Brom. Jeod took a map of 
Alagaësia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1915"><span class="calibre_class_4">On the left side 
of the map, the ocean extended to the unknown west. Along the coast stretched 
the Spine, an immense length of mountains. The Hadarac Desert filled the center 
of the map—the east end was blank. Somewhere in that void hid the Varden. To 
the south was Surda, a small country that had seceded from the Empire after the 
Riders’ fall. Eragon had been told that Surda secretly supported the Varden.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1916"><span class="calibre_class_4">Near Surda’s 
eastern border was a mountain range labeled Beor Mountains. Eragon had heard of 
them in many stories—they were supposed to be ten times the height of the 
Spine, though he privately believed that was exaggeration. The map was empty to 
the east of the Beors.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1917"><span class="calibre_class_4">Five islands 
rested off the coast of Surda: Nía, Parlim, Uden, Illium, and Beirland. Nía was 
no more than an outcropping of rock, but Beirland, the largest, had a small 
town. Farther up, near Teirm, was a jagged island called Sharktooth. And high 
to the north was one more island, immense and shaped like a knobby hand. Eragon 
knew its name without even looking: Vroengard, the ancestral home of the 
Riders—once a place of glory, but now a looted, empty shell haunted by strange 
beasts. In the center of Vroengard was the abandoned city of Dorú Areaba.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1918"><span class="calibre_class_4">Carvahall was a 
small dot at the top of Palancar Valley. Level with it, but across the plains, 
sprawled the forest Du Weldenvarden. Like the Beor Mountains, its eastern end 
was unmapped. Parts of Du Weldenvarden’s western edge had been settled, but its 
heart lay mysterious and unexplored. The forest was wilder than the Spine; the 
few who braved its depths often came back raving mad, or not at all.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1919"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon shivered 
as he saw Urû’baen in the center of the Empire. King Galbatorix ruled from 
there with his black dragon, Shruikan, by his side. Eragon put his finger on 
Urû’baen. “The Ra’zac are sure to have a hiding place here.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1920"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You had better 
hope that that isn’t their only sanctuary,” said Brom flatly. “Otherwise you’ll 
never get near them.” He pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1921"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jeod took the 
parchment out of his pouch and said, “From what I saw in the records, there 
have been shipments of Seithr oil to every major city in the Empire over the 
past five years. As far as I can tell, all of them might have been ordered by 
wealthy jewelers. I’m not sure how we can narrow down the list without more 
information.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1922"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom swept a 
hand over the map. “I think we can eliminate some cities. The Ra’zac have to 
travel wherever the king wants, and I’m sure he keeps them busy. If they’re 
expected to go anywhere at anytime, the only reasonable place for them to stay 
is at a crossroads where they can reach every part of the country fairly 
easily.” He was excited now and paced the room. “This crossroads has to be 
large enough so the Ra’zac will be inconspicuous. It also has to have enough 
trade so any unusual requests—special food for their mounts, for example—will 
go unnoticed.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1923"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That makes 
sense,” said Jeod, nodding. “Under those conditions, we can ignore most of the 
cities in the north. The only big ones are Teirm, Gil’ead, and Ceunon. I know 
they’re not in Teirm, and I doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the 
coast to Narda—it’s too small. Ceunon is too isolated . . . only Gil’ead 
remains.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1924"><span class="calibre_class_4">“The Ra’zac 
might be there,” conceded Brom. “It would have a certain irony.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1925"><span class="calibre_class_4">“It would at 
that,” Jeod acknowledged softly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1926"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What about 
southern cities?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1927"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Well,” said 
Jeod. “There’s obviously Urû’baen, but that’s an unlikely destination. If 
someone were to die from Seithr oil in Galbatorix’s court, it would be all too 
easy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the Empire had been buying 
large amounts of it. That still leaves many others, any one of which could be 
the one we want.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1928"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes,” said 
Eragon, “but the oil wasn’t sent to all of them. The parchment only lists 
Kuasta, Dras-Leona, Aroughs, and Belatona. Kuasta wouldn’t work for the Ra’zac; 
it’s on the coast and surrounded by mountains. Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon, 
though it is a center of trade. That leaves Belatona and Dras-Leona, which are 
rather close together. Of the two, I think Dras-Leona is the likelier. It’s 
larger and better situated.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1929"><span class="calibre_class_4">“And that’s 
where nearly all the goods of the Empire pass through at one time or another, 
including Teirm’s,” said Jeod. “It would be a good place for the Ra’zac to 
hide.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1930"><span class="calibre_class_4">“So . . . 
Dras-Leona,” said Brom as he sat down and lit his pipe. “What do the records 
show?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1931"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jeod looked at 
the parchment. “Here it is. At the beginning of the year, three shipments of 
Seithr oil were sent to Dras-Leona. Each shipment was only two weeks apart, and 
the records say they were all transported by the same merchant. The same thing 
happened last year and the year before that. I doubt any one jeweler, or even a 
group of them, has the money for so much oil.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1932"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What about 
Gil’ead?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1933"><span class="calibre_class_4">“It doesn’t have 
the same access to the rest of the Empire. And,” Jeod tapped the parchment, 
“they’ve only received the oil twice in recent years.” He thought for a moment, 
then said, “Besides, I think we forgot something—Helgrind.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1934"><span class="calibre_class_4">Brom nodded. “Ah 
yes, the Dark Gates. It’s been many years since I’ve thought of it. You’re 
right, that would make Dras-Leona perfect for the Ra’zac. I guess it’s decided, 
then; that’s where we’ll go.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1935"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon sat 
abruptly, too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind was.<i>I thought I 
would be happy to resume the hunt. Instead, I feel like an abyss has opened up 
before me. Dras-Leona! It’s so far away. . . .</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1936"><span class="calibre_class_4">The parchment 
crackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map. He handed it to Brom and said, 
“You’ll need this, I’m afraid. Your expeditions often take you into obscure 
regions.” Nodding, Brom accepted the map. Jeod clapped him on the shoulder. “It 
doesn’t feel right that you will leave without me. My heart expects to go 
along, but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_1937"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I know,” said 
Brom. “But you have a life in Teirm. It is time for the next generation to take
