streaked across the land when Trianna said to Eragon,<i>It is time.</i> A surge 
of energy erased Eragon’s sleepiness. Jumping to his feet, he shouted the word 
to everyone around him, even as he clambered into Saphira’s saddle, pulling his 
new bow from its quiver. The Kull and dwarves surrounded Saphira, and together 
they hurried down the breastwork until they reached the opening that had been 
cleared during the night.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_11125"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The Varden poured through the gap, quiet as 
they could be. Rank upon rank of warriors marched past, their armor and weapons 
padded with rags so no sound would alert the Empire of their approach. Saphira 
joined the procession when Nasuada appeared on a roan charger in the midst of 
the men, Arya and Trianna by her side. The five of them acknowledged each other 
with quick glances, nothing more.<p/></span></p>

accumulated low to the ground, and now the dim morning light gilded the turgid 
clouds, turning them opaque. Thus, the Varden managed to cross three-quarters 
of the no-man’s-land before they were seen by the Empire’s sentries. As the 
alarm horns rang out before them, Nasuada shouted, “Now, Eragon! Tell Orrin to 
strike. To me, men of the Varden! Fight to win back your homes. Fight to guard 
your wives and children! Fight to overthrow Galbatorix! Attack and bathe your 
blades in the blood of our enemies! Charge!” She spurred her horse forward, and 
with a great bellow, the men followed, shaking their weapons above their heads.<p/></span></p>

spellcaster who rode with King Orrin. A moment later, he heard the drumming of 
hooves as Orrin and his cavalry—accompanied by the rest of the Kull, who could 
run as fast as horses—galloped out of the east. They charged into the Empire’s 
flank, pinning the soldiers against the Jiet River and distracting them long 
enough for the Varden to cross the remainder of the distance between them 
without opposition.<p/></span></p>

Pikes clashed against spears, hammers against shields, swords against helms,

driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh meat below.<p/></span></p>

Saphira.<p/></span></p>

battle, for they would be too exposed to Galbatorix’s magicians at the front. 
Taking a deep breath, Eragon began to search for those magicians with his mind, 
firing arrows all the while.<p/></span></p>

spellcaster. The instant he was alerted, Eragon reached out to the woman who 
made the discovery, and from there to the foe she grappled with. Bringing the 
full power of his will to bear, Eragon demolished the magician’s resistance, 
took control of his consciousness—doing his best to ignore the man’s 
terror—determined which troops the man was guarding, and slew the man with one 
of the twelve words of death. Without pause, Eragon located the minds of each 
of the now-unprotected soldiers and killed them as well. The Varden cheered as 
the knot of men went limp.<p/></span></p>

Eragon. The soldiers had had no chance to escape or fight back.<i>How different 
from Farthen Dûr,</i> he thought. Though he marveled at the perfection of his 
skills, the deaths sickened him. But there was no time to dwell on it.<p/></span></p>

the Empire began to man their engines of war: catapults that cast round 
missiles of hard-baked ceramic, trebuchets armed with barrels of liquid fire, 
and ballistae that bombarded the attackers with a hail of arrows six feet long. 
The ceramic balls and the liquid fire caused terrific damage when they landed. 
One ball exploded against the ground not ten yards from Saphira. As Eragon 
ducked behind his shield, a jagged fragment spun toward his head, only to be 
stopped dead in the air by one of his wards. He blinked at the sudden loss of 
energy.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_11143"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The engines soon stalled the Varden’s advance, 
sowing mayhem wherever they aimed.<i>They have to be destroyed if we’re going 
to last long enough to wear down the Empire,</i> realized Eragon. It would be 
easy for Saphira to dismantle the machines, but she dared not fly among the 
soldiers for fear of an attack by magic.<p/></span></p>

they would be protected against any conceivable enchantment.<i>Unless . . .</i> 
Extending himself, he found the mind of a soldier who tended one of the 
catapults. Though he was sure the soldier was defended by some magician, Eragon 
was able to gain dominance over him and direct his actions from afar. He guided 
the man up to the weapon, which was being loaded, then had him use his sword to 
hack at the skein of twisted rope that powered the machine. The rope was too 
thick to sever before the soldier was dragged away by his comrades, but the 
damage was already done. With a mighty<i>crack,</i> the partially wound skein 
broke, sending the arm of the catapult flying backward and injuring several 
men. His lips curled in a grim smile, Eragon proceeded to the next catapult 
and, in short order, disabled the remainder of the engines.<p/></span></p>

dozens of the Varden collapsing around Saphira; one of Du Vrangr Gata had been 
overwhelmed. He uttered a dreadful curse and flung himself back along the trail 
of magic as he searched for the man who cast the fatal spell, entrusting the 
welfare of his body to Saphira and his guards.<p/></span></p>

magicians, but to little avail, for they were wily and cunning and did not

greater degree than ever before, vanquishing all differences between them to 
become a single entity. They bellowed, leaped forward, and forged a path to the 
front line. Once there, Eragon could not tell from whose mouth emanated the 
ravenous jet of flame that consumed a dozen soldiers, cooking them in their 
mail, nor whose arm it was that brought Zar’roc down in an arc, cleaving a

first: a great ravening creature with claws and fangs dyed red, who slew all in 
her path with swipes of her paws and lashes of her tail and with billowing 
waves of flame that engulfed entire platoons of soldiers. Her brilliant scales 
glittered like stars and nearly blinded her foes with their reflected light. 
Next they saw Eragon running alongside Saphira. He moved faster than the 
soldiers could react and, with strength beyond men, splintered shields with a 
single blow, rent armor, and clove the swords of those who opposed him. Shot 
and dart cast at him fell to the pestilent ground ten feet away, stopped by his 
wards.<p/></span></p>

Saphira—to fight his own race than it had been to fight the Urgals in Farthen

to the main body of the Varden to avoid being surrounded. By the end of their 
last attack, Eragon had to reduce or eliminate certain wards around Arya, Orik, 
Nasuada, Saphira, and himself in order to keep the spells from exhausting him 
too quickly. For though his strength was great, so too were the demands of 
battle.<p/></span></p>

shaft pierced his armor, but they knocked the wind out of him and left bruises 
the size of apples.<i>Don’t stop! You’ve dealt with worse pain than this

with mountains of their enemies, and yet the Empire never faltered or fell 
back. For every man they killed, another stepped forth to take his place. A 
sense of hopelessness engulfed Eragon as the mass of soldiers gradually forced 
the Varden to retreat toward their own camp. He saw his despair mirrored in the 
faces of Nasuada, Arya, King Orrin, and even Angela when he passed them in 
battle.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_11221"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>It was true—a great host marched out of the 
east toward the Burning Plains. At its head strode King Hrothgar, clad in gold

Eragon and Saphira.<p/></span></p>

circling high over the trampled, smoking plain. As the relentless clamor of 
combat faded from his ears, Eragon took a deep breath, feeling his mind clear. 
Below, he was surprised by how scattered both armies had become. The Empire and 
the Varden had disintegrated into a series of smaller groups contending against 
one another over the entire breadth and width of the Burning Plains. It was 
into this confused tumult that the dwarves inserted themselves, catching the 
Empire from the side—as Orrin had done earlier with his cavalry.<p/></span></p>

turned to her left and soared through the clouds in the direction of the Jiet 
River. A gust of wind blew the peat smoke out of their way and unveiled a large 
three-masted ship riding upon the orange water, rowing against the current with 
two banks of oars. The ship was scarred and damaged and flew no colors to 
declare its allegiance. Nevertheless, Eragon readied himself to destroy the 
vessel. As Saphira dove toward it, he lifted Zar’roc overhead and loosed his 
savage war cry.<p/></span></p>
