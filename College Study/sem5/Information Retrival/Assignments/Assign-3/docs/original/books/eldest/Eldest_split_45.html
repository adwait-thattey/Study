Roran left the makeshift tent he shared with Baldor, padded to the edge of the

goose-feather arrows upright in the loam, within easy reach, then wrapped 
himself in a blanket and curled against the rockface to his left. His position 
afforded him a good view down and across the dark foothills.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7373"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As was his habit, Roran divided the landscape 
into quadrants, examining each one for a full minute, always alert for the flash 
of movement or the hint of light that might betray the approach of enemies. His 
mind soon began to wander, drifting from subject to subject with the hazy logic 
of dreams, distracting him from his task. He bit the inside of his cheek to 
force himself to concentrate. Staying awake was difficult in such mild weather.

his ear and making the skin on the back of his neck prickle with an 
apprehension of evil. The intrusive touch frightened Roran, obliterating 
everything but the conviction that he and the rest of the villagers were in 
mortal danger. He quaked as if with the ague, his heart pounded, and he had to 
struggle to resist the urge to break cover and flee.<p/></span></p>

horizon. Visible only as a void among the stars, it drifted like a torn veil 
across the sky until it covered the moon, where it remained, hovering. 
Illuminated from behind, Roran could see the translucent wings of one of the Ra’zac’s 
mounts.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7383"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The black creature opened its beak and uttered 
a long, piercing shriek. Roran grimaced with pain at the cry’s pitch and 
frequency. It stabbed at his eardrums, turned his blood to ice, and replaced 
hope and joy with despair. The ululation woke the entire forest. Birds and 
beasts for miles around exploded into a yammering chorus of panic, including, 
to Roran’s alarm, what remained of the villagers’ herds.<p/></span></p>

to the camp, whispering, “The Ra’zac are here. Be quiet and stay where you 
are,” to everyone he encountered. He saw the other sentries moving among the 
frightened villagers, spreading the same message.<p/></span></p>

hand and roared, “Are we under attack? What’s set off those blasted—” Roran 
tackled the carpenter to silence him, uttering a muffled bellow as he landed on 
his right shoulder and pained his old injury.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7395"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Together they picked their way through the 
camp to the adjacent meadow where the goats, sheep, donkeys, and horses were 
bedded. The farmers who owned the bulk of the herds slept with their charges 
and were already awake and working to soothe the beasts. Roran thanked his 
paranoia that he had insisted on having the animals scattered along the edge of 
the meadow, where the trees and brush helped to camouflage them from unfriendly 
eyes.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7397"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As he tried to pacify a clump of sheep, Roran 
glanced up at the terrible black shadow that still obscured the moon, like a 
giant bat. To his horror, it began to move toward their hiding place.<i>If that 
creature screams again, we’re doomed.<p/></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7399"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>By the time the Ra’zac circled overhead, most 
of the animals had quieted, except for one donkey, who insisted upon loosing a 
grating<i>hee-haw.</i> Without hesitation, Roran dropped to one knee, fit arrow 
to string, and shot the ass between the ribs. His aim was true, and the animal 
dropped without a sound.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7400"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7401"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He was too late, though; the braying had 
already alerted the Ra’zac. The monster swung its head in the direction of the 
clearing and descended toward it with outstretched claws, preceded by its fetid 
stench.<p/></span></p>

and stampeded across the meadow, ignoring villagers and livestock alike in 
their frantic desire to escape the Ra’zac. For almost a minute, the deer 
bounded past Roran, mincing the loam with their sharp hooves and catching the 
moonlight with their white-rimmed eyes. They came so close, he heard the soft 
gasps of their labored breathing.<p/></span></p>

place, like hunted rabbits, afraid that the Ra’zac’s departure might be a ruse

They waited for hours, tense and anxious, barely moving except to string a bow.<p/></span></p>

other men hiked into Narda. Roran knew that he risked being recognized by 
accompanying them, but their mission was too important for him to neglect. 
Besides, he was confident that his current appearance was different enough from 
his portrait on the Empire’s poster that no one would equate one with the 
other.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7426"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>They had no difficulty gaining entrance, as a 
different set of soldiers guarded the town gate, whereupon they went to the 
docks and delivered the two hundred crowns to Clovis, who was busy overseeing a

bag of coins to his belt. “There be nothing like yellow gold to brighten a 
man’s day.” He led them to a worktable and unrolled a chart of the waters 
surrounding Narda, complete with notations on the strength of various currents; 
locations of rocks, sandbars, and other hazards; and decades’ worth of sounding 
measurements. Drawing a line with his finger from Narda to a small cove 
directly south of it, Clovis said, “Here’s where we’ll meet your livestock. The 
tides are gentle this time o’ year, but we still don’t want to fight them an’ 
no bones about it, so we’ll have to be on our way directly after the high 
tide.”<p/></span></p>

eye. “Aye, it would, an’ so I’ve begun many a cruise. What I don’t want, 
though, is to be slung up on the beach, loading your animals, when the tide 
comes a-rushing back in and pushes us farther inland. There be no danger of 
that this way, but we’ll have to move smart so as we’re not left high an’ dry 
when the waters recede. Assuming we do, the sea’ll work for us, eh?”<p/></span></p>

true, an’ good seamen all—who have agreed to this venture, odd as it is. Mind 
you, most of the boys were at the bottom of their tankards when I cornered them 
last night, drinking off the pay from their last voyage, but they’ll be sober

new lads each trip anyway. So long as they follow orders, they’ll do fine; 
otherwise, they’ll get a belaying pin upsides the head, mark my words. As for 
guards, I’d like to have nine—three per boat. An’ they’d better not be as green

the others prepare for departure. It did not take long, as they were accustomed 
to breaking camp each morning. Then he picked twelve men to accompany him to 
Narda the next day. They were all good fighters, but he asked the best, like 
Horst and Delwin, to remain with the rest of the villagers in case soldiers

had just begun to brighten with pale green and the damp night air numbed their 
fingers. Roran splashed his face with water and then outfitted himself with his 
bow and quiver, his ever-present hammer, one of Fisk’s shields, and one of 
Horst’s spears. The others did likewise, with the addition of swords obtained 
during the skirmishes in Carvahall.<p/></span></p>

the white-haired soldier in the throat. Scarlet blood fountained. Releasing the

shock. Unable to bear their gazes, Roran turned his back on them and gestured 
at the culvert that ran beneath the road. “Hide the bodies before anyone sees,” 
he ordered, brusque and harsh. As they hurried to obey, he examined the parapet 
on top of the wall for sentries. Fortunately, no one was visible there or in 
the street through the gate. He bent and pulled his spear free, wiping the 
blade clean on a tuft of grass.<p/></span></p>

band. “Listen. We will walk to the docks at a quick but reasonable pace. We 
will not run. When the alarm is sounded—and someone may have heard the clash 
just now—act surprised and interested but not afraid. Whatever you do, give 
people no reason to suspect us. The lives of your families and friends depend 
on it. If we are attacked, your only duty is to see the barges launched.

man to dog in an effort to identify potential enemies. Everything around him 
appeared unnaturally bright and filled with detail; it seemed as if he could

“I’ve been watching you, Stronghammer, and I’d be interested to know how you

Roran thought of the two soldiers dead by the gate.<i>They might have had

Afraid that they might lose their nerve, Roran made a show of walking about the

depth, clarity, and color, then into the<i>Red Boar</i> ’s roiling green wake, 
where ribbons of seaweed fluttered. The pitch of the barge lulled him like the 
rock of a cradle.<i>What a beautiful day it is,</i> he thought, grateful he was

about the barge, Roran asked Clovis the names and functions of various objects

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7647"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran spent the next three hours moving and 
packing the villagers’ belongings in the<i>Red Boar</i> until Clovis expressed 
his satisfaction. The bundles had to be secured so that they would not shift 
unexpectedly and injure someone, as well as distributed so that the barge rode 
level in the water, which was no easy task as the bundles were of irregular 
size and density. Then the animals were coaxed on board much to their 
displeasure—and immobilized by tethers lashed to iron rings in the hold.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7649"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Last of all came the people, who, like the 
rest of the cargo, had to be organized into a symmetrical pattern within the 
barge to keep from capsizing it. Clovis, Torson, and Flint each ended up 
standing at the fore of their barges, shouting directions to the mass of 
villagers below.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7651"><i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>What now?</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9">thought Roran as he heard an argument break 
out on the beach. Pushing his way to the source of the disturbance, he saw 
Calitha kneeling beside her stepfather, Wayland, trying to calm the old man.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7653"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“No! I won’t go on that<i>beast</i> ! You 
can’t make me,” cried Wayland. He thrashed his withered arms and beat his heels 
in an attempt to free himself from Calitha’s embrace. Spittle flew from his 
lips. “Let me<i>go,</i> I say. Let me go!”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7655"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Wincing from his blows, Calitha said, “He’s 
been unreasonable ever since we made camp last night.”<p/></span></p>

he had died in the Spine, what with the trouble he’s caused,</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9">thought Roran. He joined Calitha, 
and together they managed to soothe Wayland so that he no longer screamed and 
hit. As a reward for his good behavior, Calitha gave him a piece of jerky, 
which occupied his entire attention. While Wayland concentrated on gumming the 
meat, she and Roran were able to guide him onto the<i>Edeline</i> and get him 
settled in a deserted corner where he would not be a nuisance.<p/></span></p>

gangplanks were withdrawn, leaving a cluster of twenty men standing on the 
beach before each barge. The three groups gathered around the prows and 
prepared to push them back into the water.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7663"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran led the effort on the<i>Red Boar.</i> 
Chanting in unison, he and his men strained against the weight of the huge 
barge, the gray sand giving beneath their feet, the timbers and cables 
creaking, and the smell of sweat in the air. For a moment, their efforts seemed 
to be in vain, then the<i>Red Boar</i> lurched and slid back a foot.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7664"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_7665"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Again!” shouted Roran. Foot by foot, they 
advanced into the sea, until the frigid water surged about their waists. A 
breaker crashed over Roran, filling his mouth with seawater, which he spat out 
vigorously, disgusted by the taste of salt; it was far more intense than he 
expected.<p/></span></p>

Roran swam alongside the<i>Red Boar</i> and pulled himself up with one of the 
ropes draped over the gunwale. Meanwhile, the sailors deployed long poles that 
they used to propel the<i>Red Boar</i> into ever deeper water, as did the crews 
of the<i>Merrybell</i> and<i>Edeline.<p/></i></span></p>

from shore, Clovis ordered the poles stowed away and oars broken out, with 
which the sailors aimed the<i>Red Boar</i>’s prow toward the cove’s entrance. 
They hoisted the sail, aligned it to catch the light wind, and, at the vanguard 
of the trio of barges, set forth for Teirm upon the uncertain expanse of the 
bounding main.<p/></span></p>
