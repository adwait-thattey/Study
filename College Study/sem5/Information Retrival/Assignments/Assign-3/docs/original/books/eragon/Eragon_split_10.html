Roran said, “There was a stranger from Therinsford at Horst’s today.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_444"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What’s his 
name?” asked Eragon. He sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a 
brisk pace. His cheeks and eyes burned from the cold.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_445"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Dempton. He 
came here to have Horst forge him some sockets,” said Roran. His stocky legs 
plowed through a drift, clearing the way for Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_446"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Doesn’t 
Therinsford have its own smith?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_447"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes,” replied 
Roran, “but he isn’t skilled enough.” He glanced at Eragon. With a shrug he 
added, “Dempton needs the sockets for his mill. He’s expanding it and offered 
me a job. If I accept, I’ll leave with him when he picks up the sockets.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_448"><span class="calibre_class_4">Millers worked 
all year. During winter they ground whatever people brought them, but in 
harvest season they bought grain and sold it as flour. It was hard, dangerous 
work; workers often lost fingers or hands to the giant millstones. “Are you 
going to tell Garrow?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_449"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes.” A grimly 
amused smile played across Roran’s face.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_450"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What for? You 
know what he thinks about us going away. It’ll only cause trouble if you say 
anything. Forget about it so we can eat tonight’s dinner in peace.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_451"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I can’t. I’m 
going to take the job.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_452"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon halted. 
“Why?” They faced each other, their breath visible in the air. “I know money is 
hard to come by, but we always manage to survive. You don’t have to leave.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_453"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No, I don’t. 
But the money is for myself.” Roran tried to resume walking, but Eragon refused 
to budge.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_454"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What do you 
need it for?” he demanded.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_455"><span class="calibre_class_4">Roran’s 
shoulders straightened slightly. “I want to marry.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_456"><span class="calibre_class_4">Bewilderment and 
astonishment overwhelmed Eragon. He remembered seeing Katrina and Roran kissing 
during the traders’ visit, but marriage? “Katrina?” he asked weakly, just to 
confirm. Roran nodded. “Have you asked her?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_457"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Not yet, but 
come spring, when I can raise a house, I will.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_458"><span class="calibre_class_4">“There’s too 
much work on the farm for you to leave now,” protested Eragon. “Wait until 
we’re ready for planting.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_459"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No,” said 
Roran, laughing slightly. “Spring’s the time I’ll be needed the most. The 
ground will have to be furrowed and sown. The crops must be weeded—not to 
mention all the other chores. No, this is the best time for me to go, when all 
we really do is wait for the seasons to change. You and Garrow can make do 
without me. If all goes well, I’ll soon be back working on the farm, with a 
wife.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_460"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
reluctantly conceded that Roran made sense. He shook his head, but whether with 
amazement or anger, he knew not. “I guess I can only wish you the best of luck. 
But Garrow may take this with ill humor.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_461"><span class="calibre_class_4">“We will see.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_462"><span class="calibre_class_4">They resumed 
walking, the silence a barrier between them. Eragon’s heart was disturbed. It 
would take time before he could look upon this development with favor. When 
they arrived home, Roran did not tell Garrow of his plans, but Eragon was sure 
that he soon would.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_463"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_464"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon went to 
see the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him. He approached 
apprehensively, aware now that it was an equal.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_465"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_466"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Is that all you 
can say?” he snapped.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_467"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_468"><span class="calibre_class_4">His eyes widened 
at the unexpected reply, and he sat down roughly.<i>Now it has a sense of 
humor. What next?</i> Impulsively, he broke a dead branch with his foot. 
Roran’s announcement had put him in a foul mood. A questioning thought came 
from the dragon, so he told it what had happened. As he talked his voice grew 
steadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air. He ranted until 
his emotions were spent, then ineffectually punched the ground.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_469"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I don’t want 
him to go, that’s all,” he said helplessly. The dragon watched impassively, 
listening and learning. Eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes. 
He looked at the dragon thoughtfully. “You need a name. I heard some 
interesting ones today; perhaps you’ll like one.” He mentally ran through the 
list Brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic, 
noble, and pleasing to the ear. “What do you think of Vanilor or his successor, 
Eridor? Both were great dragons.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_470"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">No,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said the dragon. 
It sounded amused with his efforts.<i>Eragon.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_471"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That’s<i>my</i> 
name; you can’t have it,” he said, rubbing his chin. “Well, if you don’t like 
those, there are others.” He continued through the list, but the dragon 
rejected every one he proposed. It seemed to be laughing at something Eragon 
did not understand, but he ignored it and kept suggesting names. “There was 
Ingothold, he slew the . . .” A revelation stopped him.<i>That’s the problem! 
I’ve been choosing male names. You are a she!</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_472"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">The dragon 
folded her wings smugly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_473"><span class="calibre_class_4">Now that he knew 
what to look for, he came up with half a dozen names. He toyed with Miremel, 
but that did not fit—after all, it was the name of a brown dragon. Opheila and 
Lenora were also discarded. He was about to give up when he remembered the last 
name Brom had muttered. Eragon liked it, but would the dragon?<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_474"><span class="calibre_class_4">He asked.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_475"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Are you 
Saphira?” She looked at him with intelligent eyes. Deep in his mind he felt her 
satisfaction.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_476"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Something 
clicked in his head and her voice echoed, as if from a great distance. He 
grinned in response. Saphira started humming.<p/></span></p>
