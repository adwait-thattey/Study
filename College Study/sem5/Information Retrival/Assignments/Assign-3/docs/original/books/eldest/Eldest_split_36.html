<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5458"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Nasuada crossed her arms without bothering to 
conceal her impatience as she examined the two men before her.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5460"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The one on the right had a neck so thick, it 
forced his head to jut forward at nearly right angles to his shoulders, giving 
him a stubborn, dim-witted appearance. This was intensified by his heavy brow 
with its two cliffs of matted hair—almost long enough to pull over his eyes—and 
bulbous lips that remained puckered into a pink mushroom, even when he spoke. 
She knew better than to put stock in his repulsive looks, though. No matter its 
rough housing, his tongue was as clever as a jester’s.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5462"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The only identifying feature of the second man 
was his pale skin, which refused to darken under Surda’s relentless sun, even 
though the Varden had been in Aberon, the capital, for some weeks now. From his 
coloring, Nasuada guessed he had been born in the northern reaches of the 
Empire. He held a knit wool cap that he wrung into a hard rope between his 
hands.<p/></span></p>

man. “An unlucky number, by all accounts, Master Gamble. And so it has proved 
for you. You are guilty of both theft and destroying someone else’s property 
without offering proper recompense.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5474"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He gave her a jocular grin and scratched the 
side of his face. The rasp of his untrimmed fingernails over his stubble 
annoyed her, and it was only with an effort of will that she kept from asking 
him to stop. “Well, not to be disrespectful, Ma’am, but filling my stomach 
wouldn’t be a problem if you fed us properly, what with all the work we do. I’m 
a large man, an’ I need a bit o’ meat in my belly after half a day breaking 
rocks with a mattock. I did my best to resist temptation, I did. But three 
weeks of short rations and watching these farmers drive around fat livestock 
they wouldn’t share even if a body were starving . . . Well, I’ll admit, it 
broke me. I’m not a strong man when it comes to food. I like it hot and I like 
plenty of it. An’ I don’t fancy I’m the only one willing to help himself.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5476"><i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>And that’s the heart of the problem,</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9">reflected Nasuada. The Varden 
could not afford to feed its members, not even with Surda’s king, Orrin, 
helping. Orrin had opened his treasury to them, but he had refused to behave as 
Galbatorix was wont to do when moving his army across the Empire, which was to 
appropriate supplies from his countrymen without paying for them.<i>A noble 
sentiment, but one that only makes my task harder.</i> Still, she knew that 
acts like those were what separated her, Orrin, Hrothgar, and Islanzadí from 
Galbatorix’s despotism.<i>It would be so easy to cross that divide without 
noticing it.<p/></i></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5477"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5478"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I understand your reasons, Master Gamble. 
However, although the Varden aren’t a country and we answer to no one’s 
authority but our own, that does<i>not</i> give you or anyone else leave to 
ignore the rule of law as laid down by my predecessors or as it’s observed here 
in Surda. Therefore, I order you to pay a copper for each chicken you stole.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5479"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5480"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Gamble surprised her by acceding without

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5481"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5482"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“That’s it?” exclaimed the pale man. He wrung 
his cap even tighter. “That’s no fair price. If I sold them in any market, 
they’d—”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5483"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5484"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>She could not contain herself any longer. 
“Yes! You’d get more. But I happen to know that Master Gamble cannot afford to 
give you the chickens’ full price, as I’m the one who provides his salary! As I 
do yours. You forget that if I decided to acquire your poultry for the good of 
the Varden, you’d get no more than a copper a chicken and be lucky at that. Am 
I understood?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5485"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5490"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>After a moment, the pale man subsided and

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5491"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5492"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Very well. You’re both dismissed.” With an 
expression of sardonic admiration, Gamble touched his brow and bowed to Nasuada 
before backing out of the stone room with his sullen opponent. “You too,” she 
said to the guards on either side of the door.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5493"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5494"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As soon as they were gone, she slumped in her 
chair with an exhausted sigh and reached for her fan, batting it over her face 
in a futile attempt to dissipate the pinpricks of sweat that accumulated on her 
forehead. The constant heat drained her strength and made even the smallest 
task arduous.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5495"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5496"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>She suspected she would feel tired even if it 
were winter. Familiar as she was with the innermost secrets of the Varden, it 
still had taken more work than she expected to transport the entire 
organization from Farthen Dûr, through the Beor Mountains, and deliver them to 
Surda and Aberon. She shuddered, remembering long, uncomfortable days spent in 
the saddle. Planning and executing their departure had been exceedingly 
difficult, as was integrating the Varden into their new surroundings while 
simultaneously preparing for an attack on the Empire.<i>I don’t have enough 
time each day to solve all these problems,</i> she lamented.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5497"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5498"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Finally, she dropped the fan and rang the 
bellpull, summoning her handmaid, Farica. The banner hanging to the right of 
the cherrywood desk rippled as the door hidden behind it opened. Farica slipped 
out to stand with downcast eyes by Nasuada’s elbow.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5499"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5500"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Are there any more?” asked Nasuada.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5501"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5502"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“No, Ma’am.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5504"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>She tried not to let her relief show. Once a 
week, she held an open court to resolve the Varden’s various disputes. Anyone 
who felt that they had been wronged could seek an audience with her and ask for 
her judgment. She could not imagine a more difficult and thankless chore. As 
her father had often said after negotiating with Hrothgar, “A good compromise 
leaves everyone angry.” And so it seemed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5505"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5506"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Returning her attention to the matter at hand, 
she told Farica, “I want that Gamble reassigned. Give him a job where his 
talent with words will be of some use. Quartermaster, perhaps, just so long as 
it’s a job where he’ll get full rations. I don’t want to see him before me for 
stealing again.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5507"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5508"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Farica nodded and went to the desk, where she 
recorded Nasuada’s instructions on a parchment scroll. That skill alone made 
her invaluable. Farica asked, “Where can I find him?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5509"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5510"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“One of the work gangs in the quarry.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5512"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Yes, Ma’am. Oh, while you were occupied, King 
Orrin asked that you join him in his laboratory.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5513"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5514"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“What has he done in there now, blind 
himself?” Nasuada washed her wrists and neck with lavender water, then checked 
her hair in the mirror of polished silver that Orrin had given her and tugged 
on her overgown until the sleeves were straight.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5515"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5516"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Satisfied with her appearance, she swept out 
of her chambers with Farica in tow. The sun was so bright today that no torches 
were needed to illuminate the inside of Borromeo Castle, nor could their added 
warmth have been tolerated. Shafts of light fell through the crossletted arrow 
slits and glowed upon the inner wall of the corridor, striping the air with 
bars of golden dust at regular intervals. Nasuada looked out one embrasure 
toward the barbican, where thirty or so of Orrin’s orange-clad cavalry soldiers 
were setting forth on another of their ceaseless rounds of patrols in the 
countryside surrounding Aberon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5517"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5518"><i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Not that they could do much good if Galbatorix 
decided to attack us himself,</span></i><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_16">she thought bitterly. Their only protection against that was 
Galbatorix’s pride and, she hoped, his fear of Eragon. All leaders were aware 
of the risk of usurpation, but usurpers themselves were doubly afraid of the 
threat that a single determined individual could pose. Nasuada knew that she 
was playing an exceedingly dangerous game with the most powerful madman in 
Alagaësia. If she misjudged how far she could push him, she and the rest of the 
Varden would be destroyed, along with any hope of ending Galbatorix’s reign.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5519"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5520"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The clean smell of the castle reminded her of 
the times she had stayed there as a child, back when Orrin’s father, King 
Larkin, still ruled. She never saw much of Orrin then. He was five years older 
than her and already occupied with his duties as a prince. Nowadays, though, 
she often felt as if she were the elder one.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5521"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5522"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>At the door to Orrin’s laboratory, she had to 
stop and wait for his bodyguards, who were always posted outside, to announce 
her presence to the king. Soon Orrin’s voice boomed out into the stairwell: 
“Lady Nasuada! I’m so glad you came. I have something to show you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5523"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5524"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Mentally bracing herself, she entered the 
laboratory with Farica. A maze of tables laden with a fantastic array of 
alembics, beakers, and retorts confronted them, like a glass thicket waiting to 
snag their dresses on any one of its myriad fragile branches. The heavy odor of 
metallic vapors made Nasuada’s eyes water. Lifting their hems off the floor, 
she and Farica wended their way in single file toward the back of the room, 
past hourglasses and scales, arcane tomes bound with black iron, dwarven 
astrolabes, and piles of phosphorescent crystal prisms that produced fitful 
blue flashes.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5526"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>They met Orrin by a marble-topped bench, where 
he stirred a crucible of quicksilver with a glass tube that was closed at one 
end, open at the other, and must have measured at least three feet in length, 
although it was only a quarter of an inch thick.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5528"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Sire,” said Nasuada. As befitted one of equal 
rank to the king, she remained upright while Farica curtsied. “You seem to have 
recovered from the explosion last week.”<p/></span></p>

with his first dagger, he lit a taper with the coals from a brazier, which she 
could not fathom how he endured in the stifling weather, carried the flaming 
brand back to the bench, and used it to start a pipe packed with cardus weed.<p/></span></p>

found that since my eardrum hasn’t completely sealed up yet, I can do this. . .

issued from his left ear, like a snake leaving its den, and coiled up the side 
of his head. It was so unexpected, Nasuada burst out laughing, and after a 
moment, Orrin joined her, releasing a plume of smoke from his mouth. “It’s the 
most peculiar sensation,” he confided. “Tickles like crazy on the way out.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5542"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He snapped his fingers. “Of course.” Dipping 
his long glass tube in the crucible, he filled it with quicksilver, then capped 
the open end with one finger and showed the whole thing to her. “Would you 
agree that the only thing in this tube is quicksilver?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5546"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“And what about now?” With a quick movement, 
he inverted the tube and planted the open end inside the crucible, removing his 
finger. Instead of all pouring out, as Nasuada expected, the quicksilver in the 
tube dropped about halfway, then stopped and held its position. Orrin pointed 
to the empty section above the suspended metal. He asked, “What occupies that 
space?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5547"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_5548"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“It must be air,” asserted Nasuada.<p/></span></p>

were true, how would the air bypass the quicksilver or diffuse through the 
glass? No routes are available by which the atmosphere can gain admission.” He 
gestured at Farica. “What’s your opinion, maid?”<p/></span></p>

astonishment. “None, of course. At least not that I can think of. However, this 
will help us to understand the mechanics of our world, how and why things 
happen. It’s a wondrous discovery. Who knows what else it might lead to?” While 
he spoke, he emptied the tube and carefully placed it in a velvet-padded box 
that held similar delicate instruments. “The prospect that truly excites me, though, 
is of using magic to ferret out nature’s secrets. Why, just yesterday, with a 
single spell, Trianna helped me to discover two entirely new gases. Imagine 
what could be learned if magic were systematically applied to the disciplines 
of natural philosophy. I’m considering learning magic myself, if I have the 
talent for it, and if I can convince some magic users to divulge their 
knowledge. It’s a pity that your Dragon Rider, Eragon, didn’t accompany you 
here; I’m sure that he could help me.”<p/></span></p>

Surdan people had relatives in the Varden, and vice versa. They were too 
closely linked for either of them to abandon the other. No, the real reason 
that Orrin had taken offense was the question of authority. Since it was nigh 
impossible to keep large groups of armed warriors at the ready over extended 
periods of time—as Nasuada had learned, feeding that many inactive people was a 
logistical nightmare—the Varden had begun taking jobs, starting farms, and 
otherwise assimilating into their host country.<i>Where will that leave me 
eventually? As the leader of a nonexistent army? A general or councilor under 
Orrin?</i> Her position was precarious. If she moved too quickly or with too 
much initiative, Orrin would perceive it as a threat and turn against her, 
especially now that she was cloaked in the glamour of the Varden’s victory in 
Farthen Dûr. But if she waited too long, they would lose their chance to 
exploit Galbatorix’s momentary weakness. Her only advantage over the maze of 
opposition was her command of the one element that had instigated this act of 
the play: Eragon and Saphira.<p/></span></p>

command, Orrin. That was never my intention, and I apologize if it appeared 
that way.” He bowed his neck with a stiff bob. Unsure of how to continue, she 
leaned on her fingertips against the lip of the bench. “It’s only . . . so many 
things must be done. I work night and day—I keep a tablet beside my bed for 
notes—and yet I never catch up; I feel as if we are always balanced on the 
brink of disaster.”<p/></span></p>

moment. “You are newly come to your power, whereas I have held mine for a

disservice if you insist on overworking yourself. No one can function properly 
without occasional peace and quiet. They don’t have to be long breaks, just 
five or ten minutes. You could even practice your archery, and then you would 
still serve your goals, albeit in a different manner. . . . That’s why I had 
this laboratory constructed in the first place. That’s why I blow smoke and 
play with quicksilver, as you put it—so that I don’t scream with frustration
