<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2278"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>So thought Roran as he listened to the 
anguished moans of the men injured during the previous night’s battle with the 
Ra’zac and soldiers. Roran shuddered with fear and rage until his whole body 
was consumed with feverish chills that left his cheeks burning and his breath 
short. And he was sad, so very sad . . . as if the Ra’zac’s deeds had destroyed 
the innocence of his childhood haunts.<p/></span></p>

wounded, Roran continued toward Horst’s house, noting the makeshift barriers 
that filled the gaps between buildings: the boards, the barrels, the piles of 
rocks, and the splintered frames of the two wagons destroyed by the Ra’zac’s 
explosives. It all seemed pitifully fragile.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2282"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The few people who moved through Carvahall 
were glassy-eyed with shock, grief, and exhaustion. Roran was tired too, more 
than he could ever remember being. He had not slept since the night before 
last, and his arms and back ached from the fighting.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2283"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2284"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He entered Horst’s house and saw Elain 
standing by the open doorway to the dining room, listening to the steady burn 
of conversation that emanated from within. She beckoned him over.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2286"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>After they had foiled the Ra’zac’s 
counterattack, the prominent members of Carvahall had sequestered themselves in 
an attempt to decide what action the village should take and if Horst and his 
allies should be punished for initiating the hostilities. The group had been in 
deliberation most of the morning.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2287"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2288"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran peeked into the room. Seated around the 
long table were Birgit, Loring, Sloan, Gedric, Delwin, Fisk, Morn, and a number 
of others. Horst presided at the head of the table.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2289"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2292"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Morn waved a hand. “We’ve been over this 
before. Whether what<i>has</i> been done<i>should</i> have been done is beside 
the point. I happen to agree with it—Quimby was my friend as much as anyone’s, 
and I shudder to think what those monsters would do with Roran—but . . . but 
what I want to know is how we can escape this predicament.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2293"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2294"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Easy, kill the soldiers,” barked Sloan.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2296"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“And then what? More men will follow until we 
drown in a sea of crimson tunics. Even if we surrender Roran, it’ll do no good; 
you heard what the Ra’zac said—they’ll kill us if we protect Roran and enslave 
us if we don’t. You may feel differently, but, as for myself, I would rather 
die than spend my life as a slave.” Morn shook his head, his mouth set in a 
flat grim line. “We cannot survive.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2300"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“There’s nowhere to go,” retorted Kiselt. 
“We’re backed against the Spine, the soldiers have blocked the road, and beyond 
them is the rest of the Empire.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2301"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2302"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“It’s all your fault,” cried Thane, stabbing a 
shaking finger at Horst. “They will torch our houses and murder our children 
because of you. You!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2303"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2304"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Horst stood so quickly, his chair toppled over 
backward. “Where is your honor, man? Will you let them eat us without fighting 
back?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2305"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2306"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“<i>Yes,</i>if it means suicide otherwise.” Thane 
glared around the table, then stormed out past Roran. His face was contorted by 
pure, unadulterated fear.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2307"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2308"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Gedric spotted Roran then and waved him in. 
“Come, come, we’ve been waiting for you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2309"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2310"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran clasped his hands in the small of his 
back as scores of hard eyes inspected him. “How can I help?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2311"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2312"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I think,” said Gedric, “we’ve all agreed that 
it would accomplish nothing to give you to the Empire at this point. Whether we 
would if that wasn’t the case is neither here nor there. The only thing we can 
do is prepare for another attack. Horst will make spearheads—and other weapons 
if he has time—and Fisk has agreed to construct shields. Fortunately, his 
carpentry shop didn’t burn. And someone needs to oversee our defenses. We would 
like it to be you. You’ll have plenty of assistance.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2313"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2314"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran nodded. “I’ll do my best.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2316"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Beside Morn, Tara stood, towering over her 
husband. She was a large woman, with gray-streaked black hair and strong hands 
that were just as capable of twisting off a chicken’s head as separating a pair 
of brawlers. She said, “Make sure you do, Roran, else we’ll have more 
funerals.” Then she turned to Horst. “Before we go any further, there are men 
to bury. And there are children who should be sent to safety, maybe to Cawley’s 
farm on Nost Creek. You should go as well, Elain.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2317"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2318"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I won’t leave Horst,” said Elain calmly.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2320"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Tara bristled. “This is no place for a woman 
five months pregnant. You’ll lose the child running around like you have.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2321"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2322"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“It would do me far more harm to worry in

and every other wife in Carvahall will.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2323"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2324"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Horst came around the table and, with a tender 
expression, took Elain’s hand. “Nor would I have you anywhere but at my side. 
The children should go, though. Cawley will care for them well, but we must 
make sure that the route to his farm is clear.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2325"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2326"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Not only that,” rasped Loring, “none of us, 
not one blasted man jack can have a thing to do with the families down the 
valley, ’side from Cawley, of course. They can’t help us, and we don’t want 
those<i>desecrators</i> to trouble ’em.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2327"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2328"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Everyone agreed that he was right, then the 
meeting ended and the attendees dispersed throughout Carvahall. Before long, 
however, they recongregated—along with most of the village—in the small 
cemetery behind Gertrude’s house. Ten white-swathed corpses were arranged 
beside their graves, a sprig of hemlock on each of their cold chests and a 
silver amulet around each of their necks.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2329"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2330"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Gertrude stood forth and recited the men’s names: 
“Parr, Wyglif, Ged, Bardrick, Farold, Hale, Garner, Kelby, Melkolf, and Albem.” 
She placed black pebbles over their eyes, then raised her arms, lifted her face 
to the sky, and began the quavering death lay. Tears seeped from the corners of 
her closed eyes as her voice rose and fell with the immemorial phrases, sighing 
and moaning with the village’s sorrow. She sang of the earth and the night and 
of humanity’s ageless sorrow from which none escape.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2331"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2332"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>After the last mournful note faded into 
silence, family members praised the feats and traits of those they had lost. 
Then the bodies were buried.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2333"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2334"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As Roran listened, his gaze lit upon the 
anonymous mound where the three soldiers had been interred.<i>One killed by 
Nolfavrell, and two by me.</i> He could still feel the visceral shock of muscle 
and bone giving . . . crunching . . . pulping under his hammer. His bile rose 
and he had to struggle not to be sick in full view of the village.<i>I am the 
one who destroyed them.</i> Roran had never expected or wanted to kill, and yet 
he had taken more lives than anyone else in Carvahall. It felt as if his brow 
was marked with blood.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2335"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2336"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He left as soon as possible—not even stopping 
to speak with Katrina—and climbed to a point where he could survey Carvahall 
and consider how best to protect it. Unfortunately, the houses were too far 
apart to form a defensive perimeter by just fortifying the spaces between 
buildings. Nor did Roran think it would be a good idea to have soldiers 
fighting up against the walls of people’s houses and trampling their gardens.<i>The 
Anora River guards our western flank,</i> he thought,<i>but as for the rest of 
Carvahall, we couldn’t even keep a child out of it. . . . What can we build in 
a few hours that will be a strong enough barrier?<p/></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2338"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He jogged into the middle of the village and 
shouted, “I need everyone who is free to help cut down trees!” After a minute, 
men began to trickle out of the houses and through the streets. “Come on, more! 
We all have to help!” Roran waited as the group around him continued to grow.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2342"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran raised his voice so they could all hear. 
“We need a wall around Carvahall; the thicker the better. I figure if we get 
some big trees, lay them on their sides, and sharpen the branches, the Ra’zac 
will have a pretty hard time getting over them.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2346"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran hesitated, trying to gauge Carvahall’s 
circumference. “At least fifty. Maybe sixty to do it properly.” The men swore 
and began to argue. “Wait!” Roran counted the number of people in the crowd. He 
arrived at forty-eight. “If you each fell a tree in the next hour, we’ll be 
almost done. Can you do that?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2347"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2350"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Darmmen spoke up: “What about brambles? We

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2352"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran grinned. “That’s a great idea. Also, 
those of you with sons, have them harness your horses so we can drag the trees 
back.” The men agreed and scattered through Carvahall to gather axes and saws 
for the job. Roran stopped Darmmen and said, “Make sure that the trees have 
branches all along the trunk or else they won’t work.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2362"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“What is your point, Roran?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2364"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I’d like you to organize every woman and 
child, and everyone else you can, to dig. It’s too much for me to handle by 
myself, and we don’t have long. . . .” Roran looked her straight in the eyes. 
“Please.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2365"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2366"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Birgit frowned. “Why ask me?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2368"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Because, like me, you hate the Ra’zac, and I

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2369"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2370"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Aye,” whispered Birgit, then clapped her 
hands briskly. “Very well, as you wish. But I will never forget, Roran 
Garrowsson, that it was you and your family who brought about my husband’s 
doom.” She strode away before Roran could respond.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2371"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2372"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He accepted her animosity with equanimity; it 
was to be expected, considering her loss. He was only lucky she had not started 
a blood feud. Then he shook himself and ran to where the main road entered 
Carvahall. It was the weakest spot in the village and had to be doubly 
protected.<i>The Ra’zac can’t be allowed to just blast their way in again.<p/></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2374"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran recruited Baldor, and together they 
began excavating a ditch across the road. “I’ll have to go soon,” warned Baldor 
between strokes of his pickax. “Dad needs me in the forge.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2375"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2376"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran grunted an acknowledgment without 
looking up. As he worked, his mind once again filled with memories of the 
soldiers: how they had looked as he struck them, and the feeling, the horrible<i>feeling</i> 
of smashing a body as if it were a rotten stump. He paused, nauseated, and 
noted the commotion throughout Carvahall as people readied themselves for the 
next assault.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2377"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2378"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>After Baldor left, Roran completed the 
thigh-deep ditch himself, then went to Fisk’s workshop. With the carpenter’s 
permission, he had five logs from the stockpile of seasoned wood pulled by 
horses back to the main road. There Roran tipped the logs on end into the 
trench so that they formed an impenetrable barrier into Carvahall.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2379"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2380"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As he tamped down the earth around the logs, 
Darmmen trotted up. “We got the trees. They’re just being put into place now.” 
Roran accompanied him to Carvahall’s northern edge, where twelve men wrestled 
four lush green pines into alignment while a team of draft horses under the 
whip of a young boy returned to the foothills. “Most of us are helping to 
retrieve the trees. The others got inspired; they seemed determined to chop 
down the rest of the forest when I left.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2381"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2382"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Good, we can use the extra timber.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2384"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Darmmen pointed to a pile of dense brambles 
that sat on the edge of Kiselt’s fields. “I cut those along the Anora. Use them 
however you want. I’m going to find more.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2385"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2386"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran clapped him on the arm, then turned 
toward the eastern side of Carvahall, where a long, curved line of women, 
children, and men labored in the dirt. He went to them and found Birgit issuing 
orders like a general and distributing water among the diggers. The trench was 
already five feet wide and two feet deep. When Birgit paused for breath, he 
said, “I’m impressed.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2387"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2388"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>She brushed back a lock of hair without 
looking at him. “We plowed the ground to begin with. It made things easier.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2389"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2390"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Do you have a shovel I can use?” he asked. 
Birgit pointed to a mound of tools at the other end of the trench. As Roran 
walked toward it, he spied the copper gleam of Katrina’s hair in the midst of 
the bobbing backs. Beside her, Sloan hacked at the soft loam with a furious, 
obsessive energy, as if he were attempting to tear open the earth’s skin, to 
peel back its clay hide and expose the muscle beneath. His eyes were wild, and 
his teeth were bared in a knotted grimace, despite the flecks of dirt and filth 
that spotted his lips.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2391"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2392"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran shuddered at Sloan’s expression and 
hurried past, averting his face so as to avoid meeting his bloodshot gaze. He 
grabbed a shovel and immediately plunged it into the soil, doing his best to 
forget his worries in the heat of physical exertion.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2396"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The day progressed in a continuous rush of 
activity, without breaks for meals or rest. The trench grew longer and deeper, 
until it cupped two-thirds of the village and reached the banks of the Anora 
River. All the loose dirt was piled on the inside edge of the trench in an 
attempt to prevent anyone from jumping over it . . . and to make it difficult 
to climb out.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2397"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2398"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The wall of trees was finished in early 
afternoon. Roran stopped digging then to help sharpen the innumerable 
branches—which were overlapped and interlocked as much as possible—and affix 
the nets of brambles. Occasionally, they had to pull out a tree so farmers like 
Ivor could drive their livestock into the safety of Carvahall.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2399"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2400"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>By evening the fortifications were stronger 
and more extensive than Roran had dared hope, though they still required 
several more hours of work to complete to his satisfaction.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2401"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2402"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>He sat on the ground, gnawing a hunk of 
sourdough bread and staring at the stars through a haze of exhaustion. A hand 
dropped on his shoulder, and he looked up to see Albriech. “Here.” Albriech 
extended a rough shield—made of sawed boards pegged together—and a 
six-foot-long spear. Roran accepted them gratefully, then Albriech proceeded 
onward, distributing spears and shields to whomever he encountered.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2403"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2404"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran dragged himself upright, got his hammer 
from Horst’s house, and thus armed, went to the entrance to the main road, 
where Baldor and two others kept watch. “Wake me when you need to rest,” Roran 
said, then lay on the soft grass underneath the eaves of a nearby house. He 
arranged his weapons so he could find them in the dark and closed his eyes in 
eager anticipation.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2405"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2406"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Roran.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2407"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2408"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The whisper came from by his right ear. 
“Katrina?” He struggled into a sitting position, blinking as she unshuttered a 
lantern so a key of light struck his thigh. “What are you doing here?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2409"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2410"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I wanted to see you.” Her eyes, large and 
mysterious against her pale face, pooled with the night’s shadows. She took his 
arm and led him to a deserted porch far out of earshot of Baldor and the other 
guards. There she placed her hands on his cheeks and softly kissed him, but he 
was too tired and troubled to respond to her affection. She drew away and 
studied him. “What is wrong, Roran?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2411"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2412"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>A bark of humorless laughter escaped him. 
“What’s wrong? The world is wrong; it’s as askew as a picture frame knocked on 
its side.” He jammed his fist against his gut. “And I am wrong. Every time I 
allow myself to relax, I see the soldiers bleeding under my hammer. Men I<i>killed,</i> 
Katrina. And their eyes . . . their<i>eyes</i> ! They knew they were about to 
die and that they could nothing do about it.” He trembled in the darkness. 
“They knew . . . I knew . . . and I still had to do it. It couldn’t—” Words 
failed him as he felt hot tears roll down his cheeks.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2413"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2414"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Katrina cradled his head as Roran cried from 
the shock of the past few days. He wept for Garrow and Eragon; he wept for 
Parr, Quimby, and the other dead; he wept for himself; and he wept for the fate 
of Carvahall. He sobbed until his emotions ebbed and left him as dry and hollow 
as an old barley husk.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2415"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2416"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Forcing himself to take a long breath, Roran 
looked at Katrina and noticed her own tears. He brushed them away with his 
thumb, like diamonds in the night. “Katrina . . . my love.” He said it again, 
tasting the words: “My love. I have naught to give you but my love. Still . . . 
I must ask. Will you marry me?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2417"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2418"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>In the dim lantern light, he saw pure joy and 
wonder leap across her face. Then she hesitated and troubled doubt appeared. It 
was wrong for him to ask, or for her to accept, without Sloan’s permission. But 
Roran no longer cared; he had to know now if he and Katrina would spend their 
lives together.<p/></span></p>
