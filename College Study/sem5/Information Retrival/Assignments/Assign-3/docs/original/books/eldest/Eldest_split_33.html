<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4627"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Awall of thick, smoky air engulfed Roran as he 
entered the Seven Sheaves, Morn’s tavern. He stopped beneath the Urgal horns 
pegged over the door and let his eyes adjust to the dim interior. “Hello?” he 
called.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4628"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4629"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The door to the back rooms banged open as Tara 
plowed forward, trailed by Morn. They both glared sullenly at Roran. Tara 
planted her meaty fists on her hips and demanded, “What do you want here?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4631"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran stared at her for a moment, trying to 
determine the source of her animosity. “Have you decided whether to accompany 
me into the Spine?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4632"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

said, “Whatever your intentions are, if you<i>were</i> to go, Elain would like 
to know if you have room in your bags for a few more items, or if you need 
extra room yourself. She has—”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4636"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4637"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Extra room!” burst out Morn. He waved at the 
wall behind the bar, which was lined with oak casks. “I have, packed in straw, 
twelve barrels of the clearest winter ale, which have been kept at the perfect 
temperature for the past five months. They were Quimby’s last batch! What am I 
supposed to do with them? Or my hogsheads of lager and stout? If I leave them, 
the soldiers will dispose of it in a week, or they’ll spike the barrels and 
pour the beer into the ground, where the only creatures who’ll enjoy it will be 
grubs and worms. Oh!” Morn sat and wrung his hands, shaking his head. “Twelve 
years of work! Ever since Father died I ran the tavern the same way he did, day 
in and day out. And then you and Eragon had to cause this trouble. It . . .” He 
stopped, breathing with difficulty, and wiped his mashed face with the edge of 
his sleeve.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4639"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“There, there now,” said Tara. She put her arm 
around Morn and jabbed a finger at Roran. “Who gave you leave to stir up 
Carvahall with your fancy words? If we go, how will my poor husband make a 
living? He can’t take his trade with him like Horst or Gedric. He can’t squat 
in an empty field and farm it like you! Impossible! Everyone will go and we 
will starve. Or we will go and we will<i>still</i> starve. You have ruined us!”<p/></span></p>

Morn’s distraught one, then turned and opened the door. He paused on the 
threshold and said in a low voice, “I have always counted you among my friends. 
I would not have you killed by the Empire.” Stepping outside, he pulled his 
vest tight around himself and paced away from the tavern, ruminating the whole 
way.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4643"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>At Fisk’s well, he stopped for a drink and found 
himself joined by Birgit. She watched him struggle to turn the crank with only 
one hand, then took it from him and brought up the water bucket, which she 
passed to him without drinking. He sipped the cool liquid, then said, “I’m glad 
that you are coming.” He handed the bucket back.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4644"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4645"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Birgit eyed him. “I recognize the force that 
drives you, Roran, for it propels me as well; we both wish to find the Ra’zac. 
Once we do, though, I will have my compensation from you for Quimby’s death. 
Never forget that.” She pushed the full bucket back into the well and let it 
fall unchecked, the crank spinning wildly. A second later, the well echoed with 
a hollow splash.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4646"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4647"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran smiled as he watched her walk away. He 
was more pleased than upset by her declaration; he knew that even if everyone 
else in Carvahall were to forsake the cause or die, Birgit would still help him 
to hunt the Ra’zac. Afterward, though—if an afterward existed—he would have to 
pay her price or kill her. That was the only way to resolve such matters.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4651"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>By evening Horst and his sons had returned to 
the house, bearing two small bundles wrapped in oilcloth. “Is that all?” asked 
Elain. Horst nodded curtly, lay the bundles on the kitchen table, and unwrapped 
them to expose four hammers, three tongs, a clamp, a medium-sized bellows, and 
a three-pound anvil.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4652"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4653"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As the five of them sat to dinner, Albriech 
and Baldor discussed the various people they had seen making covert 
preparations. Roran listened intently, trying to keep track of who had lent 
donkeys to whom, who showed no signs of departing, and who might need help to 
leave.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4654"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4655"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“The biggest problem,” said Baldor, “is food. 
We can only carry so much, and it’ll be difficult to hunt enough in the Spine 
to feed two or three hundred people.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4656"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4657"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Mmm.” Horst shook his finger, his mouth full 
of beans, then swallowed. “No, hunting won’t work. We have to bring our flocks 
with us. Combined, we own enough sheep and goats to feed the lot of us for a 
month or more.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4658"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

from wandering off into the forest,” replied Horst. “Herding them will be a 
chore.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4665"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Roran spent the following day assisting 
whomever he could, saying little, and generally allowing people to see him 
working for the good of the village. Late that night, he tumbled into bed 
exhausted but hopeful.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4666"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4667"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The advent of dawn pierced Roran’s dreams and 
woke him with a sense of momentous expectation. He stood and tiptoed 
downstairs, then went outside and stared at the misty mountains, absorbed by 
the morning’s silence. His breath formed a white plume in the air, but he felt 
warm, for his heart throbbed with fear and eagerness.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4669"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>After a subdued breakfast, Horst brought the 
horses to the front of the house, where Roran helped Albriech and Baldor load 
them with saddlebags and other bundles of supplies. Next Roran took up his own 
pack, hissing as the leather shoulder strap pressed down on his injury.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4670"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4671"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Horst closed the door to the house. He 
lingered for a moment with his fingers on the steel doorknob, then took Elain’s 
hand and said, “Let’s go.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4672"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4673"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>As they walked through Carvahall, Roran saw 
somber families gathering by their houses with their piles of possessions and 
yammering livestock. He saw sheep and dogs with bags tied on their backs, teary-eyed 
children on donkeys, and makeshift sledges hitched to horses with crates of 
fluttering chickens hung on each side. He saw the fruits of his success, and he 
knew not whether to laugh or to cry.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4674"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4675"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>They stopped at Carvahall’s north end and 
waited to see who would join them. A minute passed, then Birgit approached from 
the side, accompanied by Nolfavrell and his younger siblings. Birgit greeted 
Horst and Elain and stationed herself nearby.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4676"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4677"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Ridley and his family arrived outside the wall 
of trees, driving over a hundred sheep from the east side of Palancar Valley. 
“I figured that it would be better to keep them out of Carvahall,” shouted 
Ridley over the animals.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4678"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4679"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Good thinking!” replied Horst.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4681"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Next came Delwin, Lenna, and their five 
children; Orval and his family; Loring with his sons; Calitha and Thane—who 
gave Roran a large smile; and then Kiselt’s clan. Those women who had been 
recently widowed, like Nolla, clustered around Birgit. Before the sun had 
cleared the mountain peaks, most of the village had assembled along the wall. 
But not all.<p/></span></p>

themselves, and when Ivor arrived, it was without any supplies. “You’re 
staying,” observed Roran. He sidestepped a knot of testy goats that Gertrude 
was attempting to restrain.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4684"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4685"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Aye,” said Ivor, drawing out the word into a 
weary admission. He shivered, crossed his bony arms for warmth, and faced the 
rising sun, lifting his head so as to catch the transparent rays. “Svart 
refused to leave. Heh! It was like carving against the grain to get him into 
the Spine in the first place. Someone has to look after him, an’ I don’t have 
any children, so . . .” He shrugged. “Doubt I could give up the farm anyway.”<p/></span></p>

anyone who remained.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4693"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>A thin, middle-aged man, Ethlbert, marched to 
the edge of the congregation and shouted, “You’re all fools!” With an ominous 
rustle, people turned to look at their accuser. “I’ve held my peace through 
this madness, but I’ll not follow a nattering lunatic! If you weren’t blinded 
by his words, you’d see that he’s leading you to destruction! Well, I won’t go! 
I’ll take my chances sneaking past the soldiers and finding refuge in 
Therinsford. They’re our own people at least, not the barbarians you’ll find in 
Surda.” He spat on the ground, then spun on his heel and stomped away.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4695"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Afraid that Ethlbert might convince others to 
defect, Roran scanned the crowd and was relieved to see nothing more than 
restless muttering. Still, he did not want to dawdle and give people a chance 
to change their minds. He asked Horst under his breath, “How long should we 
wait?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4696"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

Isold, and their borrowed horse. Leaving her husband, Isold hurried toward 
Horst, shooing her hands at anyone who got in her way, oblivious to the fact 
that most of her hair had escaped imprisonment in its bun and stuck out in odd 
tufts. She stopped, wheezing for breath. “I<i>am</i> sorry we’re so late, but 
Fisk had trouble closing up the shop. He couldn’t pick which planers or chisels 
to bring.” She laughed in a shrill tone, almost hysterical. “It was like 
watching a cat surrounded by mice trying to decide which one to chase. First 
this one, then that one.”<p/></span></p>

three beer casks tied to his back and an aggrieved look that was comic enough

donkey and two goats that they towed behind them. To Roran’s astonishment, the

Excluding Ivor, three families were determined to remain in Palancar Valley: 
Ethlbert’s, Parr’s, and Knute’s.<i>I can’t force them to come.</i> He sighed. 
“All right. There’s no sense in waiting longer.”<p/></span></p>

land, as is your duty, you would have discerned the source of the chaos that 
has swept Alagaësia and learned the truth of Arya and Eragon. That you might 
forget the Varden and the dwarves in your grief is understandable, but Brom? 
Vinr Älfakyn? The last of the Elf Friends? You have been blind to the world, 
Islanzadí, and lax upon your throne. I could not risk driving you further away

Saphira. She remained perfectly still, her neck arched stiffly as Glaedr 
sniffed her cheek and along the line of her wing. Eragon saw Saphira’s clenched 
leg muscles flutter with an involuntary tremor.<i>You smell of humans,</i> said 
Glaedr,<i>and all you know of your own race is what your instincts have taught 
you, but you have the heart of a true dragon.<p/></i></span></p>

not risk leaving this sanctuary, for if I had died before one of Galbatorix’s

fight. Glaedr has his disability, and I,” he touched the side of his head, “I 
am also maimed. The Forsworn broke something within me when I was their 
captive, and while I can still teach and learn, I can no longer control magic, 
except for the smallest of spells. The power escapes me, no matter how much I 
struggle. I would be worse than useless in battle, I would be a weakness and a 
liability, one who could easily be captured and used against you. So I removed 
myself from Galbatorix’s influence for the good of the many, even though I

with two stools and flagons of clear, cold water for both himself and Eragon. 
Eragon sipped his drink and admired the spacious view of Du Weldenvarden in an 
attempt to conceal his awe and nervousness while he waited for the elf to 
speak.<i>I’m in the presence of another Rider!</i> Beside him, Saphira crouched 
with her eyes fixed on Glaedr, slowly kneading the dirt between her claws.<p/></span></p>

and longer. Ten minutes passed . . . half an hour . . . then an hour. It

subsided into calm acceptance. He enjoyed just observing the day.<p/></span></p>

knowledge of magic to do more than delay. No, do not worry . . . it isn’t 
contagious, but neither can I rid myself of it.” He sighed. “I have spent 
decades binding myself with hundreds of small, weak spells that, layered one 
upon another, duplicate the effect of enchantments that are now beyond my

birth of the last dragons and to foster the Riders’ resurrection from the ruin

to you. We cannot shirk it for the sake of mere pain. Far too much is at risk, 
and we can ill afford to fail.” All Eragon could do was shake his head as panic

was inescapable. “Eragon. You must accept this burden freely. Have you no one

not doing this for her. Nor for Nasuada. Nor even for Arya. What drove him,

told, but the posture hurt his shoulders and he could barely make his hands 
meet. “Now bend forward while keeping your knees straight. Try to touch the 
ground.” This was even harder for Eragon; he ended up bowed like a hunchback, 
with his arms hanging uselessly by his head while his hamstrings twinged and 
burned. His fingers were still nine or ten inches from the ground. “At least 
you can stretch without hurting yourself. I had not hoped for so much. You can

had her contort every foot of her sinuous length in fantastic ways, culminating

extraordinary flier. I’ve rarely seen a dragon so naturally suited to the sky.” 
Saphira blinked, then shuffled her wings and busied herself cleaning one of her 
claws in a manner that hid her head from view. “You have room to improve, as do

reckoning, Oromis delved into every aspect of his and Saphira’s knowledge, from 
botany to woodworking to metallurgy and medicine, although he mainly 
concentrated on their grasp of history and the ancient language. The 
interrogation comforted Eragon, as it reminded him of how Brom used to quiz him

Eragon into his house, leaving the two dragons alone. The elf’s quarters were 
barren except for those few essentials necessary for food, hygiene, and the 
pursuit of an intellectual life. Two entire walls were dotted with cubbyholes 
that held hundreds of scrolls. Next to the table hung a golden sheath—the same 
color as Glaedr’s scales—and a matching sword with a blade the color of 
iridescent bronze.<p/></span></p>

heart of the wood, was a flat panel one span high and two wide. It depicted a 
beautiful, towering city built against an escarpment and caught in the ruddy 
light of a rising harvest moon. The pitted lunar face was bisected by the 
horizon and appeared to sit on the ground like a maculated dome as large as a 
mountain. The picture was so clear and perfectly detailed, Eragon at first took 
it to be a magical window; it was only when he saw that the image was indeed 
static that he could accept it as a piece of art.<p/></span></p>

the heart of your misery. You see what was once our city of Ilirea. It was 
burned and abandoned during Du Fyrn Skulblaka and became the capital of the

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4940"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Oromis’s eyes widened with dismay. “You don’t 
know?” Eragon shook his head. “How can you not? Considering your circumstances 
and the fear that Galbatorix wields among your people, I might understand that 
you were raised in darkness, ignorant of your heritage. But I cannot credit 
Brom with being so lax with your instruction as to neglect subjects that even 
the youngest elf or dwarf knows. The children of your Varden could tell me more 
about the past.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4944"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>This drew silence from Oromis. Finally, he 
said, “Forgive me. I did not mean to impugn Brom’s judgment, only I am 
impatient beyond reason; we have so little time, and each new thing you must 
learn reduces that which you can master during your tenure here.” He opened a 
series of cupboards hidden within the curved wall and removed bread rolls and 
bowls of fruit, which he rowed out on the table. He paused for a moment over 
the food with his eyes closed before beginning to eat. “The Broddring Kingdom 
was the human’s country before the Riders fell. After Galbatorix killed Vrael, 
he flew on Ilirea with the Forsworn and deposed King Angrenost, taking his 
throne and titles for his own. The Broddring Kingdom then formed the core of 
Galbatorix’s conquests. He added Vroengard and other lands to the east and 
south to his holdings, creating the empire you are familiar with. Technically, 
the Broddring Kingdom still exists, though, at this point, I doubt that it is 
much more than a name on royal decrees.”<p/></span></p>

inquiries, Eragon concentrated on his food. His face must have betrayed him, 
though, because Oromis said, “You remind me of Brom when I chose him as my 
apprentice. He was younger than you, only ten, but his curiosity was just as 
great. I doubt I heard aught from him for a year but<i>how, what, when,</i> 
and, above all else,<i>why.</i> Do not be shy to ask what lies in your heart.”<p/></span></p>

“Who are you? Where do you come from? . . . Where did Brom come from? What was 
Morzan like? How, what, when,<i>why</i> ? And I want to know everything about 
Vroengard and the Riders. Maybe then my own path will be clearer.”<p/></span></p>

meticulously disassembled a blackberry, prying out one plump segment at a time. 
When the last corpuscle vanished between his port-red lips, he rubbed his hands 
flat together—“polishing his palms,” as Garrow used to say—and said, “Know this 
about me, then: I was born some centuries past in our city of Luthivíra, which 
stood in the woods by Lake Tüdosten. At the age of twenty, like all elf 
children, I was presented to the eggs that the dragons had given the Riders, 
and Glaedr hatched for me. We were trained as Riders, and for near a century, 
we traveled the world over, doing Vrael’s will. Eventually, the day arrived 
when it was deemed appropriate for us to retire and pass on our experience to 
the next generation, so we took a position in Ilirea and taught new Riders, one 
or two at a time, until Galbatorix destroyed us.”<p/></span></p>

in a hundred different ways. He grew so proud and cruel that I considered 
separating him from Brom. But before I could, Morzan helped Galbatorix to steal

to use the turmoil to his advantage. He gathered together many of those who had 
been exiled, freed some who had been imprisoned, and with them he formed the 
Varden. He led them for a few years, then surrendered the position to another 
so that he was free to pursue his true passion, which was Morzan’s downfall.

and coy. One moment she would twist around to examine some feature of the 
clearing, the next she would shuffle her wings and make small advances on the 
larger dragon, weaving her head from side to side, the tip of her tail 
twitching as if she were about to pounce on a deer. She reminded Eragon of a 
kitten trying to bait an old tomcat into playing with her, only Glaedr remained 
impassive throughout her machinations.<p/></span></p>

It was the sort of casually cruel remark that humans often make, but that he

gray eyes heavy upon him. The elf’s gaze was so perceptive, Eragon was sure 
that Oromis understood what had transpired. Eragon forced a smile and motioned

Eragon thought was truly wise: “Those whom we love are often the most alien to 
us.” The elf paused. “She is very young, as are you. It took Glaedr and I 
decades before we fully understood each other. A Rider’s bond with his dragon 
is like any relationship—that is, a work in progress. Do you trust her?”<p/></span></p>
