<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_58"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_98">W</span><span class="calibre_class_4">ind howled 
through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world. A tall Shade 
lifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson 
hair and maroon eyes.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_59"><span class="calibre_class_4">He blinked in 
surprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He 
weighed the odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. 
Stop whoever is coming . . . or die.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_60"><span class="calibre_class_4">Around him 
shuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with 
black symbols. They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made 
for crushing. A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears. The monsters 
hurried into the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling quieted and the 
forest was silent again.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_61"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade peered 
around a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any human to 
see, but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the 
trees; every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze. He remained 
unnaturally quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin scratch curved 
down the blade. The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet 
stout enough to hack through the hardest armor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_62"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Urgals could 
not see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling with 
their weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed 
until the bird flew past. Then the monsters shivered in the cold night; one 
snapped a twig with his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger, and the Urgals 
shrank back, motionless. He suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid 
meat—and turned away. They were tools, nothing more.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_63"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade forced 
back his impatience as the minutes became hours. The scent must have wafted far 
ahead of its owners. He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves. He 
denied himself those luxuries, too, and stayed behind the tree, watching the 
trail. Another gust of wind rushed through the forest. The smell was stronger 
this time. Excited, he lifted a thin lip in a snarl.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_64"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Get ready,” he 
whispered, his whole body vibrating. The tip of his sword moved in small 
circles. It had taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment. 
It would not do to lose control now.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_65"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eyes brightened 
under the Urgals’ thick brows, and the creatures gripped their weapons tighter. 
Ahead of them, the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone. 
Faint smudges emerged from the darkness and advanced down the trail.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_66"><span class="calibre_class_4">Three white 
horses with riders cantered toward the ambush, their heads held high and proud, 
their coats rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_67"><span class="calibre_class_4">On the first 
horse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His build 
was slim but strong, like a rapier. A powerful bow was slung on his back. A 
sword pressed against his side opposite a quiver of arrows fletched with swan 
feathers.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_68"><span class="calibre_class_4">The last rider 
had the same fair face and angled features as the other. He carried a long 
spear in his right hand and a white dagger at his belt. A helm of extraordinary 
craftsmanship, wrought with amber and gold, rested on his head.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_69"><span class="calibre_class_4">Between these 
two rode a raven-haired elven lady, who surveyed her surroundings with poise. 
Framed by long black locks, her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her 
clothes were unadorned, yet her beauty was undiminished. At her side was a 
sword, and on her back a long bow with a quiver. She carried in her lap a pouch 
that she frequently looked at, as if to reassure herself that it was still 
there.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_70"><span class="calibre_class_4">One of the elves 
spoke quietly, but the Shade could not hear what was said. The lady answered 
with obvious authority, and her guards switched places. The one wearing the 
helm took the lead, shifting his spear to a readier grip. They passed the 
Shade’s hiding place and the first few Urgals without suspicion.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_71"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade was 
already savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward 
the elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and 
tossed their heads. The riders stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then 
wheeled their mounts around and galloped away.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_72"><span class="calibre_class_4">The lady’s horse 
surged forward, leaving her guards far behind. Forsaking their hiding, the 
Urgals stood and released a stream of black arrows. The Shade jumped out from 
behind the tree, raised his right hand, and shouted, “Garjzla!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_73"><span class="calibre_class_4">A red bolt 
flashed from his palm toward the elven lady, illuminating the trees with a 
bloody light. It struck her steed, and the horse toppled with a high-pitched 
squeal, plowing into the ground chest-first. She leapt off the animal with 
inhuman speed, landed lightly, then glanced back for her guards.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_74"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Urgals’ 
deadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves. They fell from the noble 
horses, blood pooling in the dirt. As the Urgals rushed to the slain elves, the 
Shade screamed, “After her! She is the one I want!” The monsters grunted and 
rushed down the trail.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_75"><span class="calibre_class_4">A cry tore from 
the elf’s lips as she saw her dead companions. She took a step toward them, 
then cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_76"><span class="calibre_class_4">While the Urgals 
crashed through the trees, the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted 
above them. From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest. He 
raised his hand and uttered, “Böetq istalri!” and a quarter-mile section of the 
forest exploded into flames. Grimly he burned one section after another until 
there was a ring of fire, a half-league across, around the ambush site. The 
flames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest. Satisfied, he watched 
the ring carefully, in case it should falter.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_77"><span class="calibre_class_4">The band of fire 
thickened, contracting the area the Urgals had to search. Suddenly, the Shade 
heard shouts and a coarse scream. Through the trees he saw three of his charges 
fall in a pile, mortally wounded. He caught a glimpse of the elf running from 
the remaining Urgals.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_78"><span class="calibre_class_4">She fled toward 
the craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed. The Shade examined the 
ground twenty feet below, then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her. She 
skidded around and sped back to the trail. Black Urgal blood dripped from her 
sword, staining the pouch in her hand.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_79"><span class="calibre_class_4">The horned 
monsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in, blocking the only escape 
routes. Her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out. Seeing none, 
she drew herself up with regal disdain. The Shade approached her with a raised 
hand, allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_80"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Get her.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_81"><span class="calibre_class_4">As the Urgals 
surged forward, the elf pulled open the pouch, reached into it, and then let it 
drop to the ground. In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the 
angry light of the fires. She raised it over her head, lips forming frantic 
words. Desperate, the Shade barked, “Garjzla!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_82"><span class="calibre_class_4">A ball of red 
flame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf, fast as an arrow. But he 
was too late. A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest, and the 
stone vanished. Then the red fire smote her and she collapsed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_83"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade howled 
in rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway 
through the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from 
his palm—which killed the Urgals instantly—then ripped his sword free and 
strode to the elf.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_84"><span class="calibre_class_4">Prophecies of 
revenge, spoken in a wretched language only he knew, rolled from his tongue. He 
clenched his thin hands and glared at the sky. The cold stars stared back, 
unwinking, otherworldly watchers. Disgust curled his lip before he turned back 
to the unconscious elf.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_85"><span class="calibre_class_4">Her beauty, 
which would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed 
that the stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among 
the trees. After tying the elf onto the saddle, he mounted the charger and made 
his way out of the woods.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_86"><span class="calibre_class_4">He quenched the 
fires in his path but left the rest to burn.<p/></span></p>
