that, over time, alter the appearance of a human Rider—and which Eragon had 
already begun to experience since bonding with Saphira—had been completed while 
he was unconscious. His face was now as smooth and angled as an elf’s, with 
ears tapered like theirs and eyes slanted like theirs, and his skin was as pale 
as alabaster and seemed to emit a faint glow, as if with the sheen of magic.<i>I 
look like a princeling.</i> Eragon had never before applied the term to a man, 
least of all himself, but the only word that described him now was<i>beautiful.</i> 
Yet he was not entirely an elf. His jaw was stronger, his brow thicker, his 
face broader. He was fairer than any human and more rugged than any elf.<p/></span></p>

of the mirror to examine his back. It was as smooth as it had been before the 
battle of Farthen Dûr. Tears sprang to Eragon’s eyes as he slid his hand over 
the place where Durza had maimed him. He knew that his back would never trouble 
him again.<p/></span></p>

to keep gone, but every other scar and blemish had vanished from his body, 
leaving him as unmarked as a newborn babe. Eragon traced a line upon his wrist 
where he had cut himself while sharpening Garrow’s scythe. No evidence of the 
wound remained. The blotchy scars on the insides of his thighs, remnants from 
his first flight with Saphira, had also disappeared. For a moment, he missed 
them as a record of his life, but his regret was short-lived as he realized 
that the damage from every injury he had ever suffered, no matter how small, 
had been repaired.<p/></span></p>

himself in his finest clothes: a crimson tunic stitched with gold thread; a

favored by the elves; and upon his forearms, leather vambraces the dwarves had 
given him.<p/></span></p>

night. None of them recognized him, though they greeted him as one of their own

awareness, his senses thrumming with the multitude of new sights, sounds, 
smells, and feelings that assailed him. He could see in darkness that would 
have blinded him before. He could touch a leaf and, by touch alone, count the 
individual hairs that grew upon it. He could identify the odors wafting about 
him as well as a wolf or a dragon. And he could hear the patter of mice in the 
underbrush and the noise a flake of bark makes as it falls to earth; the 
beating of his heart was as a drum to him.<p/></span></p>

dense woods, which echoed with fragments of music and voices from the 
festivities. Changed as he was, Eragon was acutely conscious of Arya’s 
presence, of the whisper of her clothes over her skin, of the soft, pale 
exposure of her neck, and of her eyelashes, which were coated with a layer of 
oil that made them glisten and curl like black petals wet with rain.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_8516"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>They stopped on the bank of a narrow stream so 
clear, it was invisible in the faint light. The only thing that betrayed its 
presence was the throaty gurgle of water pouring over rocks. Around them, the 
thick pines formed a cave with their branches, hiding Eragon and Arya from the 
world and muffling the cool, still air. The hollow seemed ageless, as if it 
were removed from the world and protected by some magic against the withering 
breath of time.<p/></span></p>

close to Arya, and all his passion for her sprang to the fore of his mind. He 
was so intoxicated with the strength and vitality coursing through his veins—as 
well as the untamed magic that filled the forest—he ignored caution and said, 
“How tall the trees, how bright the stars . . . and how beautiful you are, O 
Arya Svit-kona.” Under normal circumstances, he would have considered his deed 
the height of folly, but in that fey, madcap night, it seemed perfectly sane.<p/></span></p>

chin, her face grave and solemn and brushed with silver from the glimmering 
stars. A hint of steel entered her voice: “Hear me well, Eragon. This cannot, 
nor ever shall be. And until you master yourself, our friendship must cease to 
exist, for your emotions do nothing but distract us from our duty.” She bowed 
to him. “Goodbye, Eragon Shadeslayer.” Then she strode past and vanished into

dropped to the moss below, where they lay unabsorbed, like pearls strewn across

unrequited, and weeping that he had driven her further away.<p/></span></p>
