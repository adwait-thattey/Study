enemies,</i>thought Eragon. He had feared the Ra’zac ever since they first 
appeared in Carvahall, not only because of their villainous deeds but because 
he knew so little about the creatures. In his ignorance, he credited the Ra’zac 
with more powers than they actually possessed and regarded them with an almost 
superstitious dread.<i>Nightmares indeed.</i> But now that Oromis’s explanation 
had stripped away the Ra’zac’s aura of mystery, they no longer seemed quite so 
formidable. The fact that they were vulnerable to light and water strengthened 
Eragon’s conviction that when next they met, he would destroy the monsters that 
had killed Garrow and Brom.<p/></span></p>

Their depredations may have been what forced King Palancar to emigrate. When 
we, the Riders, became aware of the Ra’zac’s foul presence in Alagaësia, we did 
our best to eradicate them, as we would leaf blight. Unfortunately, we were 
only partially successful. Two Lethrblaka escaped, and they along with their 
pupae are the ones who have caused you so much grief. After he killed Vrael, 
Galbatorix sought them out and bargained for their services in return for his 
protection and a guaranteed amount of their favorite food. That is why 
Galbatorix allows them to live by Dras-Leona, one of the Empire’s largest 
cities.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6817"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“That they do,” Oromis agreed. Returning to 
the hut, he stepped through the black shadow of the doorway, then reappeared 
carrying a half-dozen slate tablets about a half-foot wide and a foot high. He 
presented one to Eragon. “Let us abandon such unpleasant topics for a time. I 
thought you might enjoy learning how to make a fairth. It is an excellent 
device for focusing your thoughts. The slate is impregnated with enough ink to 
cover it with any combination of colors. All you need do is concentrate upon 
the image that you wish to capture and then say, ‘Let that which I see in my 
mind’s eye be replicated on the surface of this tablet.’ ” As Eragon examined 
the clay-smooth slate, Oromis gestured at the clearing. “Look about you, 
Eragon, and find something worth preserving.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6819"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The first objects that Eragon noticed seemed 
too obvious, too banal to him: a yellow lily by his feet, Oromis’s overgrown 
hut, the white stream, and the landscape itself. None were unique. None would 
give an observer an insight into the subject of the fairth or he who had 
created it.<i>Things that change and are lost, that is what’s worth preserving,</i> 
he thought. His eye alighted upon the pale green nubs of spring growth at the 
tip of a tree’s branches and then the deep, narrow wound that seamed the trunk 
where a storm had broken a bough, tearing off a rope of bark with it. 
Translucent orbs of sap encrusted the seam, catching and refracting the light.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6820"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6821"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon positioned himself alongside the trunk 
so that the rotund galls of the tree’s congealed blood bulged out in silhouette 
and were framed by a cluster of shiny new needles. Then he fixed the scene in 
his mind as best he could and uttered the spell.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6822"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6823"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The surface of the gray tablet brightened as 
splashes of color bloomed across it, blending and mixing to produce the proper 
array of hues. When the pigments at last stopped moving, Eragon found himself 
looking at a strange copy of what he had wanted to reproduce. The sap and 
needles were rendered with vibrant, razor-sharp detail, while all else was 
slurred and bleary, as if seen through half-opened eyes. It was far removed 
from the universal clarity of Oromis’s fairth of Ilirea.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6824"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6825"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>At a sign from Oromis, Eragon handed the 
tablet to him. The elf studied it for a minute, then said, “You have an unusual 
way of thinking, Eragon-finiarel. Most humans have difficulty achieving the 
proper concentration to create a recognizable image. You, on the other hand, 
seem to observe nearly everything about whatever interests you. It’s a narrow 
focus, though. You have the same problem here that you do with your meditation. 
You must relax, broaden your field of vision, and allow yourself to absorb 
everything around you without judging what is important or not.” Setting aside 
the picture, Oromis took a second, blank tablet from the grass and gave it to 
Eragon. “Try again with what I—”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6829"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Startled, Eragon turned and saw Orik and Arya 
emerge side by side from the forest. The dwarf raised his arm in greeting. His 
beard was freshly trimmed and braided, his hair was pulled back into a neat 
ponytail, and he wore a new tunic—courtesy of the elves—that was red and brown 
and embroidered with gold thread. His appearance gave no indication of his 
condition the previous night.<p/></span></p>

traditional greeting, then, abandoning the ancient language, Oromis asked, “To

see, I am in the midst of working with Eragon, and that is of paramount 
importance.”<p/></span></p>

Eragon before continuing: “I was sent here by Hrothgar to ensure that Eragon

Tronjheim, I may give my king a true account of events.”<p/></span></p>

had ever seen. It was a flawed, imperfect picture, but it possessed such 
intensity and passion that it evoked a visceral response from Eragon.<i>Is this

brushed the dirt from his palms. “Yes, I believe I’ll do that. Thank you for 
your time, Oromis-elda. I appreciate it.” As he headed back toward Ellesméra, 
he said over his shoulder to Eragon, “I’ll be in the common room of Tialdarí

as he said it, Eragon knew that it was not true. She just concealed her fear 
better than most. Dropping to one knee, he took a piece of the fairth and pressed 
it into Oromis’s palm. “Why would I frighten her?” he asked. “Please, tell me.”<p/></span></p>

stream, where he scattered the fragments of slate over the bank, letting the 
gray flakes trickle through his fingers. “Fairths only show what you want them 
to. It’s possible to lie with them, to create a false image, but to do so 
requires more skill than you yet have. Arya knows this. She also knows, then, 
that your fairth was an accurate representation of your feelings for her.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6909"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Oromis smiled sadly. “Because it revealed the 
depth of your infatuation.” He pressed his fingertips together, forming a 
series of arches. “Let us analyze the situation, Eragon. While you are old 
enough to be considered a man among your people, in our eyes, you are no more 
than a child.” Eragon frowned, hearing echoes of Saphira’s words from the 
previous night. “Normally, I would not compare a human’s age to an elf’s, but 
since you share our longevity, you must also be judged by our standards.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6913"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Now then,” said Oromis, “how should Arya have 
responded to your fairth? It’s clear that you see her in a romantic light, 
yet—while I have no doubt Arya is fond of you—a union between the two of you is 
impossible due to your own youth, culture, race, and responsibilities. Your 
interest has placed Arya in an uncomfortable position. She dare not confront 
you, for fear of disrupting your training. But, as the queen’s daughter, she 
cannot ignore you and risk offending a Rider—especially one upon which so much 
depends. . . . Even if you were a fit match, Arya would refrain from 
encouraging you so that you could devote all of your energy to the task at 
hand. She would sacrifice her happiness for the greater good.” Oromis’s voice 
thickened: “You must understand, Eragon, that slaying Galbatorix is more 
important than any one person. Nothing else matters.” He paused, his gaze 
gentle, then added, “Given the circumstances, is it so strange Arya was 
frightened that your feelings for her could endanger everything we have worked 
for?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_6915"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon shook his head. He was ashamed that his

had been.<i>I could have avoided this entire mess if I’d just kept better 
control of myself.<p/></i></span></p>

him back inside the hut. “Think not that I am devoid of sympathy, Eragon. 
Everyone experiences ardor like yours at one point or another during their 
lives. It’s part of growing up. I also know how hard it is for you to deny 
yourself the usual comforts of life, but it’s necessary if we are to prevail.”<p/></span></p>

his confused feelings.<p/></span></p>
