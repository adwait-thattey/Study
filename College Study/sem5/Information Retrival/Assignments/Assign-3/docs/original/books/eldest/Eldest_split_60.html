stretched wide to each white horizon, fading as it did from the deepest green 
to a hazy, washed-out purple. Martins, rooks, and other woodland birds flitted 
above the gnarled pines, uttering shrieks of alarm when they beheld Saphira. 
She flew low to the canopy in order to protect her two passengers from the 
arctic temperatures in the upper reaches of the sky.<p/></span></p>

the Spine, this was the first time she and Eragon had had the opportunity to 
fly together over a great stretch of distance without having to stop or hold 
back for companions on the ground. Saphira was especially pleased with the 
trip, and she delighted in showing Eragon how Glaedr’s tutelage had enhanced 
her strength and endurance.<p/></span></p>

to Eragon, “I doubt I could ever be comfortable in the air, but I can 
understand why you and Saphira enjoy it so. Flying makes you feel free and 
unfettered, like a fierce-eyed hawk hunting his prey! It sets my heart 
a-pounding, it does.”<p/></span></p>

played a game of riddles with Saphira. Eragon excused himself from the contest 
as he had never been particularly adept at riddles; the twist of thought 
necessary to solve them always seemed to escape him. In this, Saphira far 
exceeded him. As most dragons are, she was fascinated by puzzles and found them 
quite easy to unravel.<p/></span></p>

increasing difficulty while Du Weldenvarden sped past below. Gaps in the 
thatched branches often revealed patches of silver, sections of the many rivers 
that threaded the forest. Around Saphira, the clouds billowed in a fantastic 
architecture: vaulting arches, domes, and columns; crenelated ramparts; towers 
the size of mountains; and ridges and valleys suffused with a glowing light 
that made Eragon feel as if they flew through a dream.<p/></span></p>

they had already left Du Weldenvarden behind and entered the auburn fields that 
separated the great forest from the Hadarac Desert. They made their camp among 
the grass and hunkered round their small fire, utterly alone upon the flat face 
of the earth. They were grim-faced and said little, for words only emphasized 
their insignificance in that bare and empty land.<p/></span></p>

some of his energy in the ruby that adorned Zar’roc’s pommel. The gem absorbed 
all the power he gave it, as well as Saphira’s when she lent her strength. It

the ruby and the twelve diamonds concealed within the belt of Beloth the Wise.<p/></span></p>

more scarce until, in turn, it was replaced by sunbaked ground bare of all but

Hadarac Desert, where so little moisture existed in the air that his lips soon 
cracked, though he smeared them with nalgask every few minutes. He sensed 
little life in the ground, only a handful of miserable plants interspersed with 
a few insects and lizards.<p/></span></p>

night at the southernmost end of Silverwood Forest, which lay along Lake 
Tüdosten and was named so because it was composed almost entirely of beeches, 
willows, and trembling poplars. In contrast to the endless twilight that lay 
beneath the brooding pines of Du Weldenvarden, Silverwood was filled with 
bright sunshine, larks, and the gentle rustling of green leaves. The trees 
seemed young and happy to Eragon, and he was glad to be there. And though all 
signs of the desert had vanished, the weather remained far warmer than he was 
accustomed to at that time of year. It felt more like summer than spring.<p/></span></p>

Aberon, a low, walled city centered around a bluff in an otherwise flat 
landscape. Borromeo Castle occupied the top of the bluff. The rambling citadel 
was protected by three concentric layers of walls, numerous towers, and, Eragon 
noted, hundreds of ballistae made for shooting down a dragon. The rich amber 
light from the low sun cast Aberon’s buildings in sharp relief and illuminated 
a plume of dust rising from the city’s western gate, where a line of soldiers 
sought entrance.<p/></span></p>

the castle, she brought Eragon into contact with the combined thoughts of the 
people in the capital. The noise overwhelmed him at first—how was he supposed 
to listen for foes and still function at the same time?—until he realized that, 
as usual, he was concentrating too much on specifics. All he had to do was 
sense people’s general intentions. He broadened his focus, and the individual 
voices clamoring for his attention subsided into a continuum of the emotions 
surrounding him. It was like a sheet of water that lay draped over the nearby 
landscape, undulating with the rise and fall of people’s feelings and spiking 
whenever someone was racked by extremes of passion.<p/></span></p>

Saphira’s powerful wings as she settled in the middle of the courtyard, sinking 
her claws into the bare ground to steady herself. The horses tethered in the 
yard neighed with fear, creating such an uproar that Eragon finally inserted 
himself in their minds and calmed them with words from the ancient language.<p/></span></p>

soldiers that lined the parapets and the drawn ballistae they manned. He did 
not fear the weapons, but he had no desire to become engaged in a fight with 
his allies.<p/></span></p>

out of the keep toward Saphira. They were led by a tall man with the same dark 
skin as Nasuada, only the third person Eragon had met with such a complexion. 
Halting ten paces away, the man bowed—as did his followers—then said, “Welcome, 
Rider. I am Dahwar, son of Kedar. I am King Orrin’s seneschal.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10372"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Dahwar bowed again. “I apologize that no one 
of higher rank than myself is present to greet guests as noble as you, but King 
Orrin, Lady Nasuada, and all the Varden have long since marched to confront 
Galbatorix’s army.” Eragon nodded. He had expected as much. “They left orders 
that if you came here seeking them, you should join them directly, for your 
prowess is needed if we are to prevail.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10378"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon shook his head. “We have no time to 
waste. Besides, it is not I who needs to see the map but Saphira, and I doubt 
she would fit in your halls.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10379"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10380"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>That seemed to catch the seneschal off guard. 
He blinked and ran his eyes over Saphira, then said, “Quite right, sir. In 
either case, our hospitality is yours. If there is aught you and your 
companions desire, you have but to ask.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10382"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>For the first time, Eragon realized that he 
could issue commands and expect them to be followed. “We need a week’s worth of 
provisions. For me, only fruit, vegetables, flour, cheese, bread—things like 
that. We also need our waterskins refilled.” He was impressed that Dahwar did 
not question his avoidance of meat. Orik added his requests then for jerky, 
bacon, and other such products.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10383"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10384"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Snapping his fingers, Dahwar sent two servants 
running back into the keep to collect the supplies. While everyone in the ward 
waited for the men to return, he asked, “May I assume by your presence here, 
Shadeslayer, that you completed your training with the elves?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10388"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I see.” Then, after a moment, Dahwar said, 
“Please excuse my impertinence, sir, for I am ignorant of the ways of the 
Riders, but are you not human? I was told you were.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10389"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10390"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“That he is,” growled Orik. “He was . . . 
changed. And you should be glad he was, or our predicament would be far worse 
than it is.” Dahwar was tactful enough not to pursue the subject, but from his 
thoughts Eragon concluded that the seneschal would have paid a handsome price 
for further details—any information about Eragon or Saphira was valuable in 
Orrin’s government.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10391"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10392"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>The food, water, and map were soon brought by 
two wide-eyed pages. At Eragon’s word, they deposited the items beside Saphira, 
looking terribly frightened as they did, then retreated behind Dahwar. Kneeling 
on the ground, Dahwar unrolled the map—which depicted Surda and the neighboring 
lands—and drew a line northwest from Aberon to Cithrí. He said, “Last I heard, 
King Orrin and Lady Nasuada stopped here for provender. They did not intend to 
stay, however, because the Empire is advancing south along the Jiet River and 
they wished to be in place to confront Galbatorix’s army when it arrives. The 
Varden could be anywhere between Cithrí and the Jiet River. This is only my 
humble opinion, but I would say the best place to look for them would be the 
Burning Plains.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10393"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10394"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“The Burning Plains?”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10396"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Dahwar smiled. “You may know them by their old

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10397"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10398"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“Ah, yes.” Now Eragon remembered. He had read 
about them in one of the histories Oromis assigned him. The plains—which 
contained huge deposits of peat—lay along the eastern side of the Jiet River 
where Surda’s border crossed it and had been the site of a skirmish between the 
Riders and the Forsworn. During the fight, the dragons inadvertently lit the 
peat with the flames from their mouths and the fire had burrowed underground, 
where it remained smoldering ever since. The land had been rendered 
uninhabitable by the noxious fumes that poured out of the glowing vents in the 
charred earth.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10399"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10400"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>A shiver crawled down Eragon’s left side as he 
recalled his premonition: banks of warriors colliding upon an orange and yellow 
field, accompanied by the harsh screams of gore-crows and the whistle of black 
arrows. He shivered again.<i>Fate is converging upon us,</i> he said to 
Saphira. Then, gesturing at the map:<i>Have you seen enough?<p/></i></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10401"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10404"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>In short order, he and Orik packed the 
supplies, remounted Saphira, and from her back thanked Dahwar for his service. 
As Saphira was about to take off again, Eragon frowned; a note of discord had 
entered the minds he was monitoring. “Dahwar, two grooms in the stables have 
gotten into an argument and one of them, Tathal, intends to commit murder. You 
can stop him, though, if you send men right away.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10405"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10406"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Dahwar widened his eyes in an expression of 
astonishment, and even Orik twisted round to look at Eragon. The seneschal 
asked, “How do you know this, Shadeslayer?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10407"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10408"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon merely said, “Because I am a Rider.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_10410"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Then Saphira unfurled her wings, and everyone 
on the ground ran back to avoid being battered by the rush of air as she 
flapped downward and soared into the sky. As Borromeo Castle dwindled behind 
them, Orik said, “Can you hear my thoughts, Eragon?”<p/></span></p>

night, but rather forged onward through the blackened sky. Of the moon and

The dead hours bloated and sagged and, it seemed to Eragon, clung to each second 
as if reluctant to surrender to the past.<p/></span></p>
