Saphira’s ribs, and she lifted her wing. Running his hands through his hair, he 
walked to the room’s precipice and leaned against one side, bark rough against 
his shoulder. Below, the forest sparkled like a field of diamonds as each tree 
reflected the morning light with a thousand thousand drops of dew.<p/></span></p>

him, twisting like an auger toward the canopy before she pulled up and circled 
through the sky, roaring with joy.<i>Morning, little one.</i> He smiled, happy 
that she was happy.<p/></span></p>

he found two trays of food—mostly fruit—that had been placed by the lintel 
during the night. By the trays was a bundle of clothes with a paper note pinned 
to it. Eragon had difficulty deciphering the flowing script, since he had not 
read for over a month and had forgotten some of the letters, but at last he 
understood that it said:<p/></span></p>

not hunt, and no meat is to be had in Ellesméra, nor in any of our cities. If 
you wish, you can do as the dragons of old were wont, and catch what you may in 
Du Weldenvarden. We only ask that you leave your kills in the forest so that

bundle of clothes onto his bed and carefully unfolded them, finding two 
full-length tunics of russet trimmed with thimbleberry green, a set of creamy 
leggings to wrap his calves in, and three pairs of socks so soft, they felt 
like liquid when he pulled them through his hands. The quality of the fabric 
shamed the weaving of the women of Carvahall as well as the dwarf clothes he 
wore now.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4349"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon was grateful for the new raiment. His

entered, testing the floor with his feet. He eyed the ceiling. “Give me a cave 
any day instead of a bird’s nest like this. How fared your night, Eragon? 
Saphira?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4354"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><p> </p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4357"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>“I slept like a rock.” The dwarf chuckled at 
his own jest, then his chin sank into his beard and he fingered the head of his 
ax. “I see you’ve eaten, so I’ll ask you to accompany me. Arya, the queen, and 
a host of other elves await you at the base of the tree.” He fixed Eragon with 
a testy gaze. “Something is going on that they haven’t told us about. I’m not 
sure what they want from you, but it’s important. Islanzadí’s as tense as a cornered 
wolf . . . I thought I’d warn you beforehand.”<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4359"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>Eragon thanked him, then the two of them 
descended by way of the stairs, while Saphira glided to earth. They were met on 
the ground by Islanzadí arrayed in a mantle of ruffled swan feathers, which were 
like winter snow heaped upon a cardinal’s breast. She greeted them and said, 
“Follow me.”<p/></span></p>

of Ellesméra, where the buildings were few and the paths were faint from 
disuse. At the base of a wooded knoll, Islanzadí stopped and said in a terrible 
voice, “Before we go any farther, the three of you must swear in the ancient 
language that you will never speak to outsiders of what you are about to see, 
not without permission from me, my daughter, or whoever may succeed us to the 
throne.”<p/></span></p>

Galbatorix—and if you are bound by the ancient language, you will never

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4369"><span lang="X-NONE" class="calibre_class_9"><span class="calibre_class_11"> </span>At last Orik said, “I believe that you mean no
