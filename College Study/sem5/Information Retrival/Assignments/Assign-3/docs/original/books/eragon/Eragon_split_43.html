<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3619"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_152">E</span><span class="calibre_class_4">ragon stretched 
in the hall; he was stiff from sitting so long. Behind him, the Twins entered 
Ajihad’s study and closed the door. Eragon looked at Orik. “I’m sorry that 
you’re in trouble because of me,” he apologized.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3620"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Don’t bother 
yourself,” grunted Orik, tugging on his beard. “Ajihad gave me what I wanted.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3621"><span class="calibre_class_4">Even Saphira was 
startled by the statement. “What do you mean?” said Eragon. “You can’t train or 
fight, and you’re stuck guarding me. How can that be what you wanted?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3622"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarf eyed 
him quietly. “Ajihad is a good leader. He understands how to keep the law yet 
remain just. I have been punished by his command, but I’m also one of 
Hrothgar’s subjects. Under his rule, I’m still free to do what I wish.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3623"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon realized 
it would be unwise to forget Orik’s dual loyalty and the split nature of power 
within Tronjheim. “Ajihad just placed you in a powerful position, didn’t he?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3624"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik chuckled 
deeply. “That he did, and in such a way the Twins can’t complain about it. 
This’ll irritate them for sure. Ajihad’s a tricky one, he is. Come, lad, I’m 
sure you’re hungry. And we have to get your dragon settled in.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3625"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira hissed. 
Eragon said, “Her name is Saphira.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3626"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik made a 
small bow to her. “My apologies, I’ll be sure to remember that.” He took an 
orange lamp from the wall and led them down the hallway.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3627"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Can others in 
Farthen Dûr use magic?” asked Eragon, struggling to keep up with the dwarf’s 
brisk pace. He cradled Zar’roc carefully, concealing the symbol on the sheath 
with his arm.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3628"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Few enough,” 
said Orik with a swift shrug under his mail. “And the ones we have can’t do 
much more than heal bruises. They’ve all had to tend to Arya because of the 
strength needed to heal her.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3629"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Except for the 
Twins.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3630"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Oeí,” grumbled 
Orik. “She wouldn’t want their help anyway; their arts are not for healing. 
Their talents lie in scheming and plotting for power—to everyone else’s 
detriment. Deynor, Ajihad’s predecessor, allowed them to join the Varden 
because he needed their support . . . you can’t oppose the Empire without 
spellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle. They’re a nasty 
pair, but they do have their uses.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3631"><span class="calibre_class_4">They entered one 
of the four main tunnels that divided Tronjheim. Clusters of dwarves and humans 
strolled through it, voices echoing loudly off the polished floor. The 
conversations stopped abruptly as they saw Saphira; scores of eyes fixed on 
her. Orik ignored the spectators and turned left, heading toward one of 
Tronjheim’s distant gates. “Where are we going?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3632"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Out of these 
halls so Saphira can fly to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim, the Star Rose. 
The dragonhold doesn’t have a roof—Tronjheim’s peak is open to the sky, like 
that of Farthen Dûr—so she, that is, you, Saphira, will be able to glide 
straight down into the hold. It is where the Riders used to stay when they 
visited Tronjheim.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3633"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Won’t it be 
cold and damp without a roof?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3634"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Nay.” Orik 
shook his head. “Farthen Dûr protects us from the elements. Neither rain nor 
snow intrude here. Besides, the hold’s walls are lined with marble caves for 
dragons. They provide all the shelter necessary. All you need fear are the 
icicles; when they fall they’ve been known to cleave a horse in two.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3635"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I will be fine,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">assured Saphira.<i>A 
marble cave is safer than any of the other places we’ve stayed.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3636"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Perhaps . . . Do 
you think Murtagh will be all right?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_41"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3637"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Ajihad strikes 
me as an honorable man. Unless Murtagh tries to escape, I doubt he will be 
harmed.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3638"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon crossed 
his arms, unwilling to talk further. He was dazed by the change in 
circumstances from the day before. Their mad race from Gil’ead was finally 
over, but his body expected to continue running and riding. “Where are our 
horses?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3639"><span class="calibre_class_4">“In the stables 
by the gate. We can visit them before leaving Tronjheim.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3640"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3641"><span class="calibre_class_4">They exited 
Tronjheim through the same gate they had entered. The gold griffins gleamed with 
colored highlights garnered from scores of lanterns. The sun had moved during 
Eragon’s talk with Ajihad—light no longer entered Farthen Dûr through the 
crater opening. Without those moted rays, the inside of the hollow mountain was 
velvety black. The only illumination came from Tronjheim, which sparkled 
brilliantly in the gloom. The city-mountain’s radiance was enough to brighten 
the ground hundreds of feet away.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3642"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik pointed at 
Tronjheim’s white pinnacle. “Fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there,” 
he told Saphira. “You may stay in any of the caves. Once you make your choice, 
bedding will be laid down in it and then no one will disturb you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3643"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I thought we 
were going to go together. I don’t want to be separated,” protested Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3644"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik turned to 
him. “Rider Eragon, I will do everything to accommodate you, but it would be 
best if Saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat. The tunnels to the 
banquet halls aren’t large enough for her to accompany us.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3645"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Why can’t you 
just bring me food in the hold?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3646"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Because,” said 
Orik with a guarded expression, “the food is prepared down here, and it is a 
long way to the top. If you wish, a servant could be sent up to the hold with a 
meal for you. It will take some time, but you could eat with Saphira then.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3647"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">He actually 
means it,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
thought, astonished that they would do so much for him. But the way Orik said 
it made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3648"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I’m weary,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Saphira.<i>And 
this dragonhold sounds to my liking. Go, have your meal, then come to me. It 
will be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers. We 
have suffered the hardships of the trail too long.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3649"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon looked at 
her thoughtfully, then said to Orik, “I’ll eat down here.” The dwarf smiled, 
seeming satisfied. Eragon unstrapped Saphira’s saddle so she could lie down 
without discomfort.<i>Would you take Zar’roc with you?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3650"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">she said, 
gathering up the sword and saddle with her claws.<i>But keep your bow. We must 
trust these people, though not to the point of foolishness.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3651"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I know,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he said, 
disquieted.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3652"><span class="calibre_class_4">With an 
explosive leap Saphira swept off the ground and into the still air. The steady 
whoosh of her wings was the only sound in the darkness. As she disappeared over 
the rim of Tronjheim’s peak, Orik let out a long breath. “Ah boy, you have been 
blessed indeed. I find a sudden longing in my heart for open skies and soaring 
cliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk. Still, my feet are better on the 
ground—preferably under it.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3653"><span class="calibre_class_4">He clapped his 
hands loudly. “I neglect my duties as host. I know you’ve not dined since that 
pitiful dinner the Twins saw fit to give you, so come, let’s find the cooks and 
beg meat and bread from them!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3654"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon followed 
the dwarf back into Tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they 
came to a long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for 
dwarves. Fires blazed in soapstone ovens behind a long counter.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3655"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik spoke words 
in an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddy-faced dwarf, who promptly handed 
them stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish. Then Orik took 
Eragon up several flights of stairs and into a small alcove carved out of 
Tronjheim’s outer wall, where they sat cross-legged. Eragon wordlessly reached 
for his food.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3656"><span class="calibre_class_4">When their 
platters were empty, Orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a long-stemmed 
pipe. He lit it, saying, “A worthy repast, though it needed a good draught of 
mead to wash it down properly.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3657"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon surveyed 
the ground below. “Do you farm in Farthen Dûr?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3658"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No, there’s 
only enough sunlight for moss, mushrooms, and mold. Tronjheim cannot survive 
without supplies from the surrounding valleys, which is one reason why many of 
us choose to live elsewhere in the Beor Mountains.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3659"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Then there are 
other dwarf cities?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3660"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Not as many as 
we would like. And Tronjheim is the greatest of them.” Leaning on an elbow, 
Orik took a deep pull on his pipe. “You have only seen the lower levels, so it 
hasn’t been apparent, but most of Tronjheim is deserted. The farther up you go, 
the emptier it gets. Entire floors have remained untouched for centuries. Most 
dwarves prefer to dwell under Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr in the caverns and 
passageways that riddle the rock. Through the centuries we have tunneled 
extensively under the Beor Mountains. It is possible to walk from one end of 
the mountain range to the other without ever setting foot on the surface.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3661"><span class="calibre_class_4">“It seems like a 
waste to have all that unused space in Tronjheim,” commented Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3662"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik nodded. 
“Some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our 
resources, but Tronjheim does perform one invaluable task.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3663"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What’s that?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3664"><span class="calibre_class_4">“In times of 
misfortune it can house our entire nation. There have been only three instances 
in our history when we have been forced to that extreme, but each time it has saved 
us from certain and utter destruction. That is why we always keep it 
garrisoned, ready for use.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3665"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’ve never seen 
anything as magnificent,” admitted Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3666"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik smiled 
around his pipe. “I’m glad you find it so. It took generations to build 
Tronjheim—and our lives are much longer than those of men. Unfortunately, 
because of the cursed Empire, few outsiders are allowed to see its glory.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3667"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How many Varden 
are here?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3668"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Dwarves or 
humans?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3669"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Humans—I want 
to know how many have fled the Empire.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3670"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik exhaled a 
long puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head. “There are about four 
thousand of your kin here. But that’s a poor indicator of what you want to 
know. Only people who wish to fight come here. The rest of them are under King 
Orrin’s protection in Surda.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3671"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">So few?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">thought Eragon 
with a sinking feeling. The royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand 
when it was fully marshaled, not counting the Urgals. “Why doesn’t Orrin fight 
the Empire himself?” he asked.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3672"><span class="calibre_class_4">“If he were to 
show open hostility,” said Orik, “Galbatorix would crush him. As it is, 
Galbatorix withholds that destruction because he considers Surda a minor 
threat, which is a mistake. It’s through Orrin’s assistance that the Varden 
have most of their weapons and supplies. Without him, there would be no 
resisting the Empire.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3673"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Don’t despair 
over the number of humans in Tronjheim. There are many dwarves here—many more 
than you have seen—and all will fight when the time comes. Orrin has also 
promised us troops for when we battle Galbatorix. The elves pledged their help 
as well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3674"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon absently 
touched Saphira’s mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto. He 
noticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on Orik’s helm. “What does that 
mean? I saw it on the floor in Tronjheim.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3675"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik lifted the 
iron-bound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving. “It 
is the symbol of my clan. We are the Ingietum, metalworkers and master smiths. 
The hammer and stars are inlaid into Tronjheim’s floor because it was the 
personal crest of Korgan, our founder. One clan to rule, with twelve 
surrounding. King Hrothgar is Dûrgrimst Ingietum as well and has brought my 
house much glory, much honor.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3676"><span class="calibre_class_4">When they 
returned the platters to the cook, they passed a dwarf in the hall. He stopped before 
Eragon, bowed, and said respectfully, “Argetlam.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3677"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarf left 
Eragon fumbling for an answer, flushed with unease, yet also strangely pleased 
with the gesture. No one had bowed to him before. “What did he say?” he asked, 
leaning closer to Orik.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3678"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik shrugged, 
embarrassed. “It’s an elven word that was used to refer to the Riders. It means 
‘silver hand.’ ” Eragon glanced at his gloved hand, thinking of the gedwëy 
ignasia that whitened his palm. “Do you wish to return to Saphira?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3679"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Is there 
somewhere I could bathe first? I haven’t been able to wash off the grime of the 
road for a long time. Also, my shirt is bloodstained and torn, and it stinks. 
I’d like to replace it, but I don’t have any money to buy a new one. Is there a 
way I could work for one?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3680"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Do you seek to 
insult Hrothgar’s hospitality, Eragon?” demanded Orik. “As long as you are in 
Tronjheim, you won’t have to buy a thing. You’ll pay for it in other 
ways—Ajihad and Hrothgar will see to that. Come. I’ll show you where to wash, 
then fetch you a shirt.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3681"><span class="calibre_class_4">He took Eragon 
down a long staircase until they were well below Tronjheim. The corridors were 
tunnels now—which cramped Eragon because they were only five feet high—and all 
the lanterns were red. “So the light doesn’t blind you when you leave or enter 
a dark cavern,” explained Orik.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3682"><span class="calibre_class_4">They entered a 
bare room with a small door on the far side. Orik pointed. “The pools are 
through there, along with brushes and soap. Leave your clothes here. I’ll have 
new ones waiting when you get out.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3683"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon thanked 
him and started to undress. It felt oppressive being alone underground, 
especially with the low rock ceiling. He stripped quickly and, cold, hurried 
through the door, into total darkness. He inched forward until his foot touched 
warm water, then eased himself into it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3684"><span class="calibre_class_4">The pool was 
mildly salty, but soothing and calm. For a moment he was afraid of drifting 
away from the door, into deeper water, but as he waded forward, he discovered 
the water reached only to his waist. He groped over a slippery wall until he 
found the soap and brushes, then scrubbed himself. Afterward he floated with 
his eyes closed, enjoying the warmth.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3685"><span class="calibre_class_4">When he emerged, 
dripping, into the lighted room, he found a towel, a fine linen shirt, and a 
pair of breeches. The clothes fit him reasonably well. Satisfied, he went out 
into the tunnel.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3686"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik was waiting 
for him, pipe in hand. They climbed the stairs back up into Tronjheim, then 
exited the city-mountain. Eragon gazed at Tronjheim’s peak and called Saphira 
with his mind. As she flew down from the dragonhold, he asked, “How do you 
communicate with people at the top of Tronjheim?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3687"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik chuckled. 
“That’s a problem we solved long ago. You didn’t notice, but behind the open 
arches that line each level is a single, unbroken staircase that spirals around 
the wall of Tronjheim’s central chamber. The stairs climb all the way to the 
dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim. We call it Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. 
Running up or down it isn’t swift enough for an emergency, nor convenient 
enough for casual use. Instead, we use flashing lanterns to convey messages. 
There is another way too, though it is seldom used. When Vol Turin was 
constructed, a polished trough was cut next to it. The trough acts as a giant 
slide as high as a mountain.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3688"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon’s lips 
twitched with a smile. “Is it dangerous?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3689"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Do not think of 
trying it. The slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man. If you 
slipped out of it, you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches, 
perhaps even into empty space.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3690"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira landed a 
spear’s throw away, her scales rustling dryly. As she greeted Eragon, humans 
and dwarves trickled out of Tronjheim, gathering around her with murmurs of 
interest. Eragon regarded the growing crowd uneasily. “You’d better go,” said 
Orik, pushing him forward. “Meet me by this gate tomorrow morning. I’ll be 
waiting.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3691"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon balked. 
“How will I know when it’s morning?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3692"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’ll have 
someone wake you. Now go!” Without further protest, Eragon slipped through the 
jostling group that surrounded Saphira and jumped onto her back.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3693"><span class="calibre_class_4">Before she could 
take off, an old woman stepped forward and grasped Eragon’s foot with a fierce 
grip. He tried to pull away, but her hand was like an iron talon around his 
ankle—he could not break her tenacious hold. The burning gray eyes she fixed on 
him were surrounded by a lifetime’s worth of wrinkles—the skin was folded in 
long creases down her sunken cheeks. A tattered bundle rested in the crook of 
her left arm.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3694"><span class="calibre_class_4">Frightened, 
Eragon asked, “What do you want?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3695"><span class="calibre_class_4">The woman tilted 
her arm, and a cloth fell from the bundle, revealing a baby’s face. Hoarse and 
desperate, she said, “The child has no parents—there is no one to care for her 
but me, and I am weak. Bless her with your power, Argetlam. Bless her for 
luck!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3696"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon looked to 
Orik for help, but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression. The small 
crowd fell silent, waiting for his response. The woman’s eyes were still 
fastened on him. “Bless her, Argetlam, bless her,” she insisted.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3697"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon had never 
blessed anyone. It was not something done lightly in Alagaësia, as a blessing 
could easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boon—especially if it was 
spoken with ill intent or lack of conviction.<i>Do I dare take that 
responsibility?</i> he wondered.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3698"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Bless her, Argetlam, 
bless her.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3699"><span class="calibre_class_4">Suddenly 
decided, he searched for a phrase or expression to use. Nothing came to mind 
until, inspired, he thought of the ancient language. This would be a true 
blessing, spoken with words of power, by one of power.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3700"><span class="calibre_class_4">He bent down and 
tugged the glove off his right hand. Laying his palm on the babe’s brow, he 
intoned, “Atra gülai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waíse skölir frá rauthr.” 
The words left him unexpectedly weak, as if he had used magic. He slowly pulled 
the glove back on and said to the woman, “That is all I can do for her. If any 
words have the power to forestall tragedy, it will be those.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3701"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Thank you, 
Argetlam,” she whispered, bowing slightly. She started to cover the baby again, 
but Saphira snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child. The woman 
grew rigid; her breath caught in her chest. Saphira lowered her snout and 
brushed the baby between the eyes with the tip of her nose, then smoothly 
lifted away.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3702"><span class="calibre_class_4">A gasp ran 
through the crowd, for on the child’s forehead, where Saphira had touched her, 
was a star-shaped patch of skin as white and silvery as Eragon’s gedwëy 
ignasia. The woman stared at Saphira with a feverish gaze, wordless thanks in 
her eyes.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3703"><span class="calibre_class_4">Immediately 
Saphira took flight, battering the awestruck spectators with the wind from her 
powerful wing strokes. As the ground dwindled away, Eragon took a deep breath 
and hugged her neck tightly.<i>What did you do?</i> he asked softly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3704"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I gave her hope. 
And you gave her a future.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_36"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3705"><span class="calibre_class_4">Loneliness 
suddenly flowered within Eragon, despite Saphira’s presence. Their surroundings 
were so foreign—it struck him for the first time exactly how far he was from 
home. A destroyed home, but still where his heart lay.<i>What have I become, 
Saphira?</i> he asked.<i>I’m only in the first year of manhood, yet I’ve 
consulted with the leader of the Varden, am pursued by Galbatorix, and have 
traveled with Morzan’s son—and now blessings are sought from me! What wisdom 
can I give people that they haven’t already learned? What feats can I achieve 
that an army couldn’t do better? It’s insanity! I should be back in Carvahall 
with Roran.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3706"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira took a 
long time to answer, but her words were gentle when they came.<i>A hatchling, 
that is what you are. A hatchling struggling into the world. I may be younger 
than you in years, but I am ancient in my thoughts. Do not worry about these 
things. Find peace in where and what you are. People often know what must be 
done. All you need do is show them the way—that is wisdom. As for feats, no 
army could have given the blessing you did.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3707"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">But it was 
nothing,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he 
protested.<i>A trifle.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3708"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Nay, it wasn’t. 
What you saw was the beginning of another story, another legend. Do you think 
that child will ever be content to be a tavern keeper or a farmer when her brow 
is dragon-marked and your words hang over her? You underestimate our power and 
that of fate.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3709"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon bowed his 
head.<i>It’s overwhelming. I feel as if I am living in an illusion, a dream 
where all things are possible. Amazing things do happen, I know, but always to 
someone else, always in some far-off place and time. But I found your egg, was 
tutored by a Rider, and dueled a Shade—those can’t be the actions of the farm 
boy I am, or was. Something is changing me.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3710"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">It is your wyrd 
that shapes you,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said 
Saphira.<i>Every age needs an icon—perhaps that lot has fallen to you. Farm 
boys are not named for the first Rider without cause. Your namesake was the 
beginning, and now you are the continuation. Or the end.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3711"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Ach,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Eragon, 
shaking his head.<i>It’s like speaking in riddles. . . . But if all is 
foreordained, do our choices mean anything? Or must we just learn to accept our 
fate?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3712"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira said 
firmly,<i>Eragon, I chose you from within my egg. You have been given a chance 
most would die for. Are you unhappy with that? Clear your mind of such 
thoughts. They cannot be answered and will make you no happier.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3713"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">True,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he said glumly.<i>All 
the same, they continue to bounce around within my skull.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3714"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Things have been 
. . . unsettled . . . ever since Brom died. It has made me uneasy,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">acknowledged 
Saphira, which surprised him because she rarely seemed perturbed. They were 
above Tronjheim now. Eragon looked down through the opening in its peak and saw 
the floor of the dragonhold: Isidar Mithrim, the great star sapphire. He knew that 
beneath it was nothing but Tronjheim’s great central chamber. Saphira descended 
to the dragonhold on silent wings. She slipped over its rim and dropped to 
Isidar Mithrim, landing with the sharp clack of claws.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3715"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Won’t you 
scratch it?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">asked 
Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3716"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I think not. 
It’s no ordinary gem.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
slid off her back and slowly turned in a circle, absorbing the unusual sight. 
They were in a round roofless room sixty feet high and sixty feet across. The 
walls were lined with the dark openings of caves, which differed in size from 
grottoes no larger than a man to a gaping cavern larger than a house. Shiny 
rungs were set into the marble walls so that people could reach the highest 
caves. An enormous archway led out of the dragonhold.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3717"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon examined 
the great gem under his feet and impulsively lay down on it. He pressed his 
cheek against the cool sapphire, trying to see through it. Distorted lines and 
wavering spots of color glimmered through the stone, but its thickness made it 
impossible to discern anything clearly on the floor of the chamber a mile below 
them.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3718"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Will I have to 
sleep apart from you?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3719"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira shook 
her enormous head.<i>No, there is a bed for you in my cave. Come see.</i> She 
turned and, without opening her wings, jumped twenty feet into the air, landing 
in a medium-sized cave. He clambered up after her.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3720"><span class="calibre_class_4">The cave was 
dark brown on the inside and deeper than he had expected. The roughly chiseled 
walls gave the impression of a natural formation. Near the far wall was a thick 
cushion large enough for Saphira to curl up on. Beside it was a bed built into 
the side of the wall. The cave was lit by a single red lantern equipped with a 
shutter so its glow could be muted.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3721"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I like this,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Eragon.<i>It 
feels safe.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3722"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira curled 
up on the cushion, watching him. With a sigh he sank onto the mattress, 
weariness seeping through him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3723"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira, you 
haven’t said much while we’ve been here. What do you think of Tronjheim and 
Ajihad?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3724"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">We shall see. . 
. . It seems, Eragon, that we are embroiled in a new type of warfare here. 
Swords and claws are useless, but words and alliances may have the same effect. 
The Twins dislike us—we should be on our guard for any duplicities they might 
attempt. Not many of the dwarves trust us. The elves didn’t want a human Rider, 
so there will be opposition from them as well. The best thing we can do is 
identify those in power and befriend them. And quickly, too.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3725"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Do you think 
it’s possible to remain independent of the different leaders?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3726"><span class="calibre_class_4">She shuffled her 
wings into a more comfortable position.<i>Ajihad supports our freedom, but we 
may be unable to survive without pledging our loyalty to one group or another. 
We’ll soon know either way.</i><p/></span></p>

bunched underneath Eragon when he woke, but he was still warm. Saphira was 
asleep on her cushion, her breath coming in steady gusts.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3729"><span class="calibre_class_4">For the first 
time since entering Farthen Dûr, Eragon felt secure and hopeful. He was warm 
and fed and had been able to sleep as long as he liked. Tension unknotted 
inside him—tension that had been accumulating since Brom’s death and, even 
before, since leaving Palancar Valley.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3730"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I don’t have to 
be afraid anymore. But what about Murtagh?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_11">No matter the Varden’s 
hospitality, Eragon could not accept it in good conscience, knowing 
that—intentionally or not—he had led Murtagh to his imprisonment. Somehow the 
situation had to be resolved.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3731"><span class="calibre_class_4">His gaze roamed 
the cave’s rough ceiling as he thought of Arya. Chiding himself for 
daydreaming, he tilted his head and looked out at the dragonhold. A large cat 
sat on the edge of the cave, licking a paw. It glanced at him, and he saw a 
flash of slanted red eyes.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3732"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Solembum?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he asked 
incredulously.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3733"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Obviously.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">The werecat 
shook his rough mane and yawned languorously, displaying his long fangs. He 
stretched, then jumped out of the cave, landing with a solid thump on Isidar 
Mithrim, twenty feet below.<i>Coming?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3734"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon looked at 
Saphira. She was awake now, watching him motionlessly.<i>Go. I will be fine,</i> 
she murmured. Solembum was waiting for him under the arch that led to the rest 
of Tronjheim.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3735"><span class="calibre_class_4">The moment 
Eragon’s feet touched Isidar Mithrim, the werecat turned with a flick of his 
paws and disappeared through the arch. Eragon chased after him, rubbing the 
sleep from his face. He stepped through the archway and found himself standing 
at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. There was nowhere else to go, 
so he descended to the next level.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3736"><span class="calibre_class_4">He stood in an 
open arcade that curved gently to the left and encircled Tronjheim’s central 
chamber. Between the slender columns supporting the arches, Eragon could see 
Isidar Mithrim sparkling brilliantly above him, as well as the city-mountain’s 
distant base. The circumference of the central chamber increased with each 
successive level. The staircase cut through the arcade’s floor to an identical 
level below and descended through scores of arcades until it disappeared in the 
distance. The sliding trough ran along the outside curve of the stairs. At the 
top of Vol Turin was a pile of leather squares to slide on. To Eragon’s right, 
a dusty corridor led to that level’s rooms and apartments. Solembum padded down 
the hall, flipping his tail.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3737"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Wait,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3738"><span class="calibre_class_4">He tried to 
catch up with Solembum, but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned 
passageways. Then, as Eragon rounded a corner, he saw the werecat stop before a 
door and yowl. Seemingly of its own accord, the door slid inward. Solembum 
slipped inside, then the door shut. Eragon halted in front of it, perplexed. He 
raised his hand to knock, but before he did, the door opened once more, and 
warm light spilled out. After a moment’s indecision he stepped inside.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3739"><span class="calibre_class_4">He entered an 
earthy two-room suite, lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants. 
The air was warm, fresh, and humid. Bright lanterns hung on the walls and from 
the low ceiling. Piles of intriguing items cluttered the floor, obscuring the 
corners. A large four-poster bed, curtained by even more plants, was in the far 
room.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3740"><span class="calibre_class_4">In the center of 
the main room, on a plush leather chair, sat the fortuneteller and witch, 
Angela. She smiled brightly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3741"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What are you 
doing here?” blurted Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3742"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela folded 
her hands in her lap. “Well, why don’t you sit on the floor and I’ll tell you? 
I’d offer you a chair, but I’m sitting on the only one.” Questions buzzed 
through Eragon’s mind as he settled between two flasks of acrid bubbling green 
potions.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3743"><span class="calibre_class_4">“So!” exclaimed 
Angela, leaning forward. “You<i>are</i> a Rider. I suspected as much, but I 
didn’t know for certain until yesterday. I’m sure Solembum knew, but he never 
told me. I should have figured it out the moment you mentioned Brom. Saphira . 
. . I like the name—fitting for a dragon.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3744"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Brom’s dead,” 
said Eragon abruptly. “The Ra’zac killed him.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3745"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela was taken 
aback. She twirled a lock of her dense curls. “I’m sorry. I truly am,” she said 
softly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3746"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon smiled bitterly. 
“But not surprised, are you? You foretold his death, after all.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3747"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I didn’t know 
whose death it would be,” she said, shaking her head. “But no . . . I’m not 
surprised. I met Brom once or twice. He didn’t care for my ‘frivolous’ attitude 
toward magic. It irritated him.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3748"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon frowned. 
“In Teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke. 
Why?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3749"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela’s face 
tightened momentarily. “In retrospect, it was in rather bad taste, but I didn’t 
know what would befall him. How do I put this? . . . Brom was cursed in a way. 
It was his wyrd to fail at all of his tasks except one, although through no 
fault of his own. He was chosen as a Rider, but his dragon was killed. He loved 
a woman, but it was his affection that was her undoing. And he was chosen, I 
assume, to guard and train you, but in the end he failed at that as well. The 
only thing he succeeded at was killing Morzan, and a better deed he couldn’t 
have done.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3750"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Brom never 
mentioned a woman to me,” retorted Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3751"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela shrugged 
carelessly. “I heard it from one who couldn’t have lied. But enough of this 
talk! Life goes on, and we should not trouble the dead with our worries.” She 
scooped a pile of reeds from the floor and deftly started plaiting them 
together, closing the subject to discussion.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3752"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
hesitated, then gave in. “All right. So why are you in Tronjheim instead of 
Teirm?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3753"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Ah, at last an 
interesting question,” said Angela. “After hearing Brom’s name again during 
your visit, I sensed a return of the past in Alagaësia. People were whispering 
that the Empire was hunting a Rider. I knew then that the Varden’s dragon egg 
must have hatched, so I closed my shop and set out to learn more.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3754"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You knew about 
the egg?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3755"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Of course I 
did. I’m not an idiot. I’ve been around much longer than you would believe. 
Very little happens that I don’t know about.” She paused and concentrated on 
her weaving. “Anyway, I knew I had to get to the Varden as fast as possible. 
I’ve been here for nearly a month now, though I really don’t care for this 
place—it’s far too musty for my taste. And everyone in Farthen Dûr is<i>so</i> 
serious and noble. They’re probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway.” She 
gave a long sigh, a mocking expression on her face. “And the dwarves are just a 
superstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their lives. The 
only redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow 
inside Farthen Dûr.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3756"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Then why stay?” 
asked Eragon, smiling.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3757"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Because I like 
to be wherever important events are occurring,” said Angela, cocking her head. 
“Besides, if I had stayed in Teirm, Solembum would have left without me, and I 
enjoy his company. But tell me, what adventures have befallen you since last we 
talked?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3758"><span class="calibre_class_4">For the next 
hour, Eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months. 
Angela listened quietly, but when he mentioned Murtagh’s name she sputtered, 
“Murtagh!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3759"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon nodded. 
“He told me who he is. But let me finish my story before you make any 
judgments.” He continued with his tale. When it was complete, Angela leaned 
back in her chair thoughtfully, her reeds forgotten. Without warning, Solembum 
jumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap. He curled up, eyeing Eragon 
haughtily.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3760"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela petted 
the werecat. “Fascinating. Galbatorix allied with the Urgals, and Murtagh 
finally out in the open. . . . I’d warn you to be careful with Murtagh, but 
you’re obviously aware of the danger.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3761"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Murtagh has 
been a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally,” said Eragon firmly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3762"><span class="calibre_class_4">“All the same, 
be careful.” Angela paused, then said distastefully, “And then there’s the 
matter of this Shade, Durza. I think he’s the greatest threat to the Varden 
right now, aside from Galbatorix. I<i>loathe</i> Shades—they practice the most 
unholy magic, after necromancy. I’d like to dig his heart out with a dull 
hairpin and feed it to a pig!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3763"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon was 
startled by her sudden vehemence. “I don’t understand. Brom told me that Shades 
were sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will, but why does that 
make them so evil?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3764"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela shook her 
head. “It doesn’t. Ordinary sorcerers are just that, ordinary—neither better 
nor worse than the rest of us. They use their magical strength to control 
spirits and the spirits’ powers. Shades, however, relinquish that control in 
their search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlled<i>by</i> 
spirits. Unfortunately, only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans, and 
once ensconced they never leave. Such possession can happen by accident if a 
sorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself. The problem is, once a Shade 
is created, it’s terribly difficult to kill. As I’m sure you know, only two 
people, Laetri the Elf and Irnstad the Rider, ever survived that feat.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3765"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’ve heard the 
stories.” Eragon gestured at the room. “Why are you living so high up in 
Tronjheim? Isn’t it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all 
this stuff up here?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3766"><span class="calibre_class_4">Angela threw 
back her head and laughed wryly. “Truthfully? I’m in hiding. When I first came 
to Tronjheim, I had a few days of peace—until one of guards who let me into 
Farthen Dûr blabbed about who I was. Then all the magic users here, though they<i>barely</i> 
rate the term, pestered me to join their secret group. Especially those drajl 
Twins who control it. Finally, I threatened to turn the lot of them into toads, 
excuse me, frogs, but when that didn’t deter them, I sneaked up here in the 
middle of the night. It was less work than you might imagine, especially for 
one with my skills.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3767"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Did you have to 
let the Twins into your mind before you were allowed into Farthen Dûr?” asked 
Eragon. “I was forced to let them sift through my memories.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3768"><span class="calibre_class_4">A cold gleam 
leapt into Angela’s eye. “The Twins wouldn’t dare probe me, for fear of what I 
might do to them. Oh, they’d love to, but they know the effort would leave them 
broken and gibbering nonsense. I’ve been coming here long before the Varden 
began examining people’s minds . . . and they’re not about to start on me now.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3769"><span class="calibre_class_4">She peered into 
the other room and said, “Well! This has been an enlightening talk, but I’m 
afraid you have to go now. My brew of mandrake root and newt’s tongue is about 
to boil, and it needs attending. Do come back again when you have the time. And<i>please</i> 
don’t tell anyone that I’m here. I’d hate to have to move again. It would make 
me very . . .<i>irritated.</i> And you don’t want to see me irritated!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3770"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I’ll keep your 
secret,” assured Eragon, getting up.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3771"><span class="calibre_class_4">Solembum jumped 
off Angela’s lap as she stood. “Good!” she exclaimed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3772"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon said 
farewell and left the room. Solembum guided him back to the dragonhold, then 
dismissed him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3773"><a name="c55" id="c55"><span class="calibre_class_4">H</span></a><span class="calibre_class_4"> </span><span class="calibre_class_25">ALL OF

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3774"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_154">A</span><span class="calibre_class_4">dwarf was 
waiting for Eragon in the dragonhold. After bowing and muttering, “Argetlam,” 
the dwarf said with a thick accent, “Good. Awake. Knurla Orik waits for you.” 
He bowed again and scurried away. Saphira jumped out of her cave, landing next 
to Eragon. Zar’roc was in her claws.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3775"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">What’s that for?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he asked, 
frowning.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3776"><span class="calibre_class_4">She tilted her 
head.<i>Wear it. You are a Rider and should bear a Rider’s sword. Zar’roc may 
have a bloody history, but that should not shape your actions. Forge a new 
history for it, and carry it with pride.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3777"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Are you 
sure?Remember Ajihad’s counsel.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_41"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3778"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira snorted, 
and a puff of smoke rose from her nostrils.<i>Wear it, Eragon. If you wish to 
remain above the forces here, do not let anyone’s disapproval dictate your 
actions.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3779"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">As you wish,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he said 
reluctantly, buckling on the sword. He clambered onto her back, and Saphira 
flew out of Tronjheim. There was enough light in Farthen Dûr now that the hazy 
mass of the crater walls—five miles away in each direction—was visible. While 
they spiraled down to the city-mountain’s base, Eragon told Saphira about his 
meeting with Angela.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3780"><span class="calibre_class_4">As soon as they 
landed by one of Tronjheim’s gates, Orik ran to Saphira’s side. “My king, 
Hrothgar, wishes to see both of you. Dismount quickly. We must hurry.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3781"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon trotted 
after the dwarf into Tronjheim. Saphira easily kept pace beside them. Ignoring 
stares from people within the soaring corridor, Eragon asked, “Where will we 
meet Hrothgar?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3782"><span class="calibre_class_4">Without slowing, 
Orik said, “In the throne room beneath the city. It will be a private audience 
as an act of otho—of ‘faith.’ You do not have to address him in any special 
manner, but speak to him respectfully. Hrothgar is quick to anger, but he is 
wise and sees keenly into the minds of men, so think carefully before you 
speak.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3783"><span class="calibre_class_4">Once they 
entered Tronjheim’s central chamber, Orik led the way to one of the two 
descending stairways that flanked the opposite hall. They started down the 
right-hand staircase, which gently curved inward until it faced the direction 
they had come from. The other stairway merged with theirs to form a broad 
cascade of dimly lit steps that ended, after a hundred feet, before two granite 
doors. A seven-pointed crown was carved across both doors.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3784"><span class="calibre_class_4">Seven dwarves 
stood guard on each side of the portal. They held burnished mattocks and wore 
gem-encrusted belts. As Eragon, Orik, and Saphira approached, the dwarves 
pounded the floor with the mattocks’ hafts. A deep boom rolled back up the 
stairs. The doors swung inward.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3785"><span class="calibre_class_4">A dark hall lay 
before them, a good bowshot long. The throne room was a natural cave; the walls 
were lined with stalagmites and stalactites, each thicker than a man. Sparsely 
hung lanterns cast a moody light. The brown floor was smooth and polished. At 
the far end of the hall was a black throne with a motionless figure upon it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3786"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik bowed. “The 
king awaits you.” Eragon put his hand on Saphira’s side, and the two of them 
continued forward. The doors closed behind them, leaving them alone in the dim 
throne room with the king.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3787"><span class="calibre_class_4">Their footsteps 
echoed through the hall as they advanced toward the throne. In the recesses 
between the stalagmites and stalactites rested large statues. Each sculpture 
depicted a dwarf king crowned and sitting on a throne; their sightless eyes 
gazed sternly into the distance, their lined faces set in fierce expressions. A 
name was chiseled in runes beneath each set of feet.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3788"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon and 
Saphira strode solemnly between the two rows of long-dead monarchs. They passed 
more than forty statues, then only dark and empty alcoves awaiting future 
kings. They stopped before Hrothgar at the end of the hall.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3789"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarf king 
himself sat like a statue upon a raised throne carved from a single piece of black 
marble. It was blocky, unadorned, and cut with unyielding precision. Strength 
emanated from the throne, strength that harked back to ancient times when 
dwarves had ruled in Alagaësia without opposition from elves or humans. A gold 
helm lined with rubies and diamonds rested on Hrothgar’s head in place of a 
crown. His visage was grim, weathered, and hewn of many years’ experience. 
Beneath a craggy brow glinted deep-set eyes, flinty and piercing. Over his 
powerful chest rippled a shirt of mail. His white beard was tucked under his 
belt, and in his lap he held a mighty war hammer with the symbol of Orik’s clan 
embossed on its head.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3790"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon bowed 
awkwardly and knelt. Saphira remained upright. The king stirred, as if 
awakening from a long sleep, and rumbled, “Rise, Rider, you need not pay 
tribute to me.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3791"><span class="calibre_class_4">Straightening, 
Eragon met Hrothgar’s impenetrable eyes. The king inspected him with a hard 
gaze, then said gutturally, “Âz knurl deimi lanok<i>.</i>‘Beware, the rock 
changes’—an old dictum of ours. . . . And nowadays the rock changes very fast 
indeed.” He fingered the war hammer. “I could not meet with you earlier, as 
Ajihad did, because I was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans. They 
demanded that I deny you sanctuary and expel you from Farthen Dûr. It has taken 
much work on my part to convince them otherwise.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3792"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Thank you,” 
said Eragon. “I didn’t anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3793"><span class="calibre_class_4">The king 
accepted his thanks, then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed. “See there, Rider 
Eragon, where my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones. One and forty 
there are, with I the forty-second. When I pass from this world into the care 
of the gods, my hírna will be added to their ranks. The first statue is the 
likeness of my ancestor Korgan, who forged this mace, Volund. For eight 
millennia—since the dawn of our race—dwarves have ruled under Farthen Dûr. We 
are the bones of the land, older than both the fair elves and the savage 
dragons.” Saphira shifted slightly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3794"><span class="calibre_class_4">Hrothgar leaned 
forward, his voice gravelly and deep. “I am old, human—even by our 
reckoning—old enough to have seen the Riders in all their fleeting glory, old 
enough to have spoken with their last leader, Vrael, who paid tribute to me 
within these very walls. Few are still alive who can claim that much. I 
remember the Riders and how they meddled in our affairs. I also remember the 
peace they kept that made it possible to walk unharmed from Tronjheim to Narda.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3795"><span class="calibre_class_4">“And now you 
stand before me—a lost tradition revived. Tell me, and speak truly in this, why 
have you come to Farthen Dûr? I know of the events that made you flee the 
Empire, but what is your intent now?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3796"><span class="calibre_class_4">“For now, 
Saphira and I merely want to recuperate in Tronjheim,” Eragon replied. “We are 
not here to cause trouble, only to find sanctuary from the dangers we’ve faced 
for many months. Ajihad may send us to the elves, but until he does, we have no 
wish to leave.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3797"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Then was it 
only the desire for safety that drove you?” asked Hrothgar. “Do you just seek 
to live here and forget your troubles with the Empire?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3798"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon shook his 
head, his pride rejecting that statement. “If Ajihad told you of my past, you 
should know that I have grievances enough to fight the Empire until it is 
nothing but scattered ashes. More than that, though . . . I want to aid those 
who cannot escape Galbatorix, including my cousin. I have the strength to help, 
so I must.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3799"><span class="calibre_class_4">The king seemed 
satisfied by his answer. He turned to Saphira and asked, “Dragon, what think 
you in this matter? For what reason have you come?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3800"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira lifted 
the edge of her lip to growl.<i>Tell him that I thirst for the blood of our 
enemies and eagerly await the day when we ride to battle against Galbatorix. 
I’ve no love or mercy for traitors and egg breakers like that false king. He 
held me for over a century and, even now, still has two of my brethren, whom I 
would free if possible. And tell Hrothgar I think you ready for this task.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3801"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon grimaced 
at her words, but dutifully relayed them. The corner of Hrothgar’s mouth lifted 
in a hint of grim amusement, deepening his wrinkles. “I see that dragons have 
not changed with the centuries.” He rapped the throne with a knuckle. “Do you 
know why this seat was quarried so flat and angular? So that no one would sit comfortably 
on it. I have not, and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes. 
What is there to remind you of your obligations, Eragon? If the Empire falls, 
will you take Galbatorix’s place and claim his kingship?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3802"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I don’t seek to 
wear the crown or rule,” said Eragon, troubled. “Being a Rider is 
responsibility enough. No, I would not take the throne in Urû’baen . . . not 
unless there was no one else willing or competent enough to take it.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3803"><span class="calibre_class_4">Hrothgar warned 
gravely, “Certainly you would be a kinder king than Galbatorix, but no race 
should have a leader who does not age or leave the throne. The time of the 
Riders has passed, Eragon. They will never rise again—not even if Galbatorix’s 
other eggs were to hatch.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3804"><span class="calibre_class_4">A shadow crossed 
his face as he gazed at Eragon’s side. “I see that you carry an enemy’s sword; 
I was told of this, and that you travel with a son of the Forsworn. It does not 
please me to see this weapon.” He extended a hand. “I would like to examine 
it.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3805"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon drew 
Zar’roc and presented it to the king, hilt first. Hrothgar grasped the sword 
and ran a practiced eye over the red blade. The edge caught the lantern light, 
reflecting it sharply. The dwarf king tested the point with his palm, then 
said, “A masterfully forged blade. Elves rarely choose to make swords—they 
prefer bows and spears—but when they do, the results are unmatched. This is an 
ill-fated blade; I am not glad to see it within my realm. But carry it if you 
will; perhaps its luck has changed.” He returned Zar’roc, and Eragon sheathed 
it. “Has my nephew proved helpful during your time here?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3806"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Who?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3807"><span class="calibre_class_4">Hrothgar raised 
a tangled eyebrow. “Orik, my youngest sister’s son. He’s been serving under 
Ajihad to show my support for the Varden. It seems that he has been returned to 
my command, however. I was gratified to hear that you defended him with your 
words.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3808"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
understood that this was another sign of otho, of “faith,” on Hrothgar’s part. 
“I couldn’t ask for a better guide.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3809"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That is good,” 
said the king, clearly pleased. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak with you much 
longer. My advisors wait for me, as there are matters I must deal with. I will 
say this, though: If you wish the support of the dwarves within my realm, you 
must first prove yourself to them. We have long memories and do not rush to 
hasty decisions. Words will decide nothing, only deeds.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3810"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I will keep 
that in mind,” said Eragon, bowing again.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3811"><span class="calibre_class_4">Hrothgar nodded 
regally. “You may go, then.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3812"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon turned 
with Saphira, and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king. Orik was 
waiting for them on the other side of the stone doors, an anxious expression on 
his face. He fell in with them as they climbed back up to Tronjheim’s main 
chamber. “Did all go well? Were you received favorably?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3813"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I think so. But 
your king is cautious,” said Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3814"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That is how he 
has survived this long.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3815"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I would not want 
Hrothgar angry at us,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">observed 
Saphira.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3816"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon glanced 
at her.<i>No, I wouldn’t either. I’m not sure what he thought of you—he seems 
to disapprove of dragons, though he didn’t say it outright.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3817"><span class="calibre_class_4">That seemed to 
amuse Saphira.<i>In that he is wise, especially since he’s barely knee-high to 
me.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3818"><span class="calibre_class_4">In Tronjheim’s 
center, under the sparkling Isidar Mithrim, Orik said, “Your blessing yesterday 
has stirred up the Varden like an overturned beehive. The child Saphira touched 
has been hailed as a future hero. She and her guardian have been quartered in 
the finest rooms. Everyone is talking about your ‘miracle.’ All the human 
mothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3819"><span class="calibre_class_4">Alarmed, Eragon 
furtively looked around. “What should we do?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3820"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Aside from 
taking back your actions?” asked Orik dryly. “Stay out of sight as much as 
possible. Everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold, so you won’t be 
disturbed there.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3821"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon did not 
want to return to the dragonhold yet. It was early in the day, and he wanted to 
explore Tronjheim with Saphira. Now that they were out of the Empire, there was 
no reason for them to be apart. But he wanted to avoid attention, which would 
be impossible with her at his side.<i>Saphira, what do you want to do?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3822"><span class="calibre_class_4">She nosed him, 
scales brushing his arm.<i>I’ll return to the dragonhold. There’s someone there 
I want to meet. Wander around as long as you like.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3823"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">All right,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he said,<i>but 
who do you want to meet?</i> Saphira only winked a large eye at him before 
padding down one of Tronjheim’s four main tunnels.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3824"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon explained 
to Orik where she was going, then said, “I’d like some breakfast. And then I’d 
like to see more of Tronjheim; it’s such an incredible place. I don’t want to 
go to the training grounds until tomorrow, as I’m still not fully recovered.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3825"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik nodded, his 
beard bobbing on his chest. “In that case, would you like to visit Tronjheim’s 
library? It’s quite old and contains many scrolls of great value. You might 
find it interesting to read a history of Alagaësia that hasn’t been tainted by 
Galbatorix’s hand.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3826"><span class="calibre_class_4">With a pang, 
Eragon remembered how Brom had taught him to read. He wondered if he still had 
the skill. A long time had passed since he had seen any written words. “Yes, 
let’s do that.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3827"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Very well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3828"><span class="calibre_class_4">After they ate, 
Orik guided Eragon through myriad corridors to their destination. When they 
reached the library’s carved arch, Eragon stepped through it reverently.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3829"><span class="calibre_class_4">The room 
reminded him of a forest. Rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark, 
ribbed ceiling five stories above. Between the pillars, black-marble bookcases 
stood back to back. Racks of scrolls covered the walls, interspersed with 
narrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases. Placed at regular 
intervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches. Between them 
were small tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3830"><span class="calibre_class_4">Countless books 
and scrolls were stored in the room. “This is the true legacy of our race,” 
said Orik. “Here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars, from 
antiquity to the present. Also recorded are the songs and stories composed by 
our artisans. This library may be our most precious possession. It isn’t all 
our work, though—there are human writings here as well. Yours is a 
short-lived—but prolific—race. We have little or nothing of the elves’. They 
guard their secrets jealously.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3831"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How long may I 
stay?” asked Eragon, moving toward the shelves.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3832"><span class="calibre_class_4">“As long as you 
want. Come to me if you have any questions.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3833"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon browsed 
through the volumes with delight, reaching eagerly for those with interesting 
titles or covers. Surprisingly, dwarves used the same runes to write as humans. 
He was somewhat disheartened by how hard reading was after months of neglect. 
He skipped from book to book, slowly working his way deep into the vast 
library. Eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by Dóndar, the 
tenth dwarf king.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3834"><span class="calibre_class_4">As he scanned 
the graceful lines, unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase. 
The sound startled him, but he berated himself for being silly—he could not be 
the only person in the library. Even so, he quietly replaced the book and 
slipped away, senses alert for danger. He had been ambushed too many times to 
ignore such feelings. He heard the footsteps again; only now there were two 
sets of them. Apprehensive, he darted across an opening, trying to remember 
exactly where Orik was sitting. He sidestepped around a corner and started as 
he found himself face to face with the Twins.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3835"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Twins stood 
together, their shoulders meeting, a blank expression on their smooth faces. 
Their black snake eyes bored into him. Their hands, hidden within the folds of 
their purple robes, twitched slightly. They both bowed, but the movement was 
insolent and derisive.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3836"><span class="calibre_class_4">“We have been 
searching for you,” one said. His voice was uncomfortably like the Ra’zac’s.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3837"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
suppressed a shiver. “What for?” He reached out with his mind and contacted 
Saphira. She immediately joined thoughts with him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3838"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Ever since you 
met with Ajihad, we have wanted to . . . apologize for our actions.” The words 
were mocking, but not in a way Eragon could challenge. “We have come to pay 
homage to you.” Eragon flushed angrily as they bowed again.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3839"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Careful!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">warned Saphira.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3840"><span class="calibre_class_4">He pushed back 
his rising temper. He could not afford to be riled by this confrontation. An 
idea came to him, and he said with a small smile, “Nay, it is I who pay homage 
to you. Without your approval I never could have gained entrance to Farthen 
Dûr.” He bowed to them in turn, making the movement as insulting as he could.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3841"><span class="calibre_class_4">There was a 
flicker of irritation in the Twins’ eyes, but they smiled and said, “We are 
honored that one so . . . important . . . as yourself thinks so highly of us. 
We are in your debt for your kind words.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3842"><span class="calibre_class_4">Now it was 
Eragon’s turn to be irritated. “I will remember that when I’m in need.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3843"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira intruded 
sharply in his thoughts.<i>You’re overdoing it.Don’t say anything you’ll 
regret. They will remember every word they can use against you.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3844"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">This is 
difficult enough without you making comments!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_11">he snapped. She subsided with an 
exasperated grumble.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3845"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Twins moved 
closer, the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor. Their voices 
became more pleasant. “We have searched for you for another reason as well, 
Rider. The few magic users who live in Tronjheim have formed a group. We call 
ourselves Du Vrangr Gata, or the—”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3846"><span class="calibre_class_4">“The Wandering 
Path, I know,” interrupted Eragon, remembering what Angela had said about it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3847"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Your knowledge 
of the ancient language is impressive,” said a Twin smoothly. “As we were 
saying, Du Vrangr Gata has heard of your mighty feats, and we have come to 
extend an invitation of membership. We would be honored to have one of your 
stature as a member. And I suspect that we might be able to assist you as 
well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3848"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3849"><span class="calibre_class_4">The other Twin 
said, “The two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters. We could 
guide you . . . show you spells we’ve discovered and teach you words of power. 
Nothing would gladden us more than if we could assist, in some small way, your 
path to glory. No repayment would be necessary, though if you saw fit to share 
some scraps of your own knowledge, we would be satisfied.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3850"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon’s face 
hardened as he realized what they were asking for. “Do you think I’m a half-wit?” 
he demanded harshly. “I won’t apprentice myself to you so you can learn the 
words Brom taught me! It must have angered you when you couldn’t steal them 
from my mind.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3851"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Twins 
abruptly dropped their facade of smiles. “We are not to be trifled with, boy! 
We are the ones who will test your abilities with magic. And that could be<i>most</i> 
unpleasant. Remember, it only takes one misconceived spell to kill someone. You 
may be a Rider, but the two of us are still stronger than you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3852"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon kept his 
face expressionless, even as his stomach knotted painfully. “I will consider 
your offer, but it may—”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3853"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Then we will 
expect your answer tomorrow. Make sure that it is the right one.” They smiled 
coldly and stalked deeper into the library.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3854"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon scowled.<i>I’m 
not going to join Du Vrangr Gata, no matter what they do.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3855"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">You should talk 
to Angela,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said 
Saphira.<i>She’s dealt with the Twins before. Perhaps she could be there when 
they test you. That might prevent them from harming you.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3856"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">That’s a good 
idea.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
wound through the bookcases until he found Orik sitting on a bench, busily 
polishing his war ax. “I’d like to return to the dragonhold.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3857"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarf slid 
the haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt, then escorted Eragon to 
the gate where Saphira waited. People had already gathered around her. Ignoring 
them, Eragon scrambled onto Saphira’s back, and they escaped to the sky.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3858"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">This problem 
must be resolved quickly. You cannot let the Twins intimidate you,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira said as 
she landed on Isidar Mithrim.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3859"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I know. But I 
hope we can avoid angering them.They could be dangerous enemies.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">He dismounted 
quickly, keeping a hand on Zar’roc.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3860"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">So can you. Do 
you want them as allies?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_36"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3861"><span class="calibre_class_4">He shook his 
head.<i>Not really . . . I’ll tell them tomorrow that I won’t join Du Vrangr 
Gata.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3862"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon left 
Saphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold. He wanted to see 
Angela, but he didn’t remember how to find her hiding place, and Solembum was 
not there to guide him. He roamed the deserted corridors, hoping to meet Angela 
by chance.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3863"><span class="calibre_class_4">When he grew 
tired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls, he retraced his 
footsteps to the hold. As he neared it, he heard someone speaking within the 
room. He halted and listened, but the clear voice fell silent.<i>Saphira?Who’s 
in there?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3864"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">A female . . . 
She has an air of command. I’ll distract her while you come in.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon loosened 
Zar’roc in its sheath.<i>Orik said that intruders would be kept out of the 
dragonhold, so who could this be?</i> He steadied his nerves, then stepped into 
the hold, his hand on the sword.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3865"><span class="calibre_class_4">A young woman 
stood in the center of the room, looking curiously at Saphira, who had stuck 
her head out of the cave. The woman appeared to be about seventeen years old. 
The star sapphire cast a rosy light on her, accentuating skin the same deep 
shade as Ajihad’s. Her velvet dress was wine red and elegantly cut. A jeweled 
dagger, worn with use, hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3866"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon crossed 
his arms, waiting for the woman to notice him. She continued to look at 
Saphira, then curtsied and asked sweetly, “Please, could you tell me where 
Rider Eragon is?” Saphira’s eyes sparkled with amusement.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3867"><span class="calibre_class_4">With a small 
smile, Eragon said, “I am here.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3868"><span class="calibre_class_4">The woman 
whirled to face him, hand flying to her dagger. Her face was striking, with 
almond-shaped eyes, wide lips, and round cheekbones. She relaxed and curtsied 
again. “I am Nasuada,” she said.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3869"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon inclined 
his head. “You obviously know who I am, but what do you want?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3870"><span class="calibre_class_4">Nasuada smiled 
charmingly. “My father, Ajihad, sent me here with a message. Would you like to 
hear it?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3871"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Varden’s 
leader had not struck Eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood. He 
wondered who Nasuada’s mother was—she must have been an uncommon woman to have 
attracted Ajihad’s eye. “Yes, I would.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3872"><span class="calibre_class_4">Nasuada tossed 
her hair back and recited: “He is pleased that you are doing well, but he 
cautions you against actions like your benediction yesterday. They create more 
problems than they solve. Also, he urges you to proceed with the testing as 
soon as possible—he needs to know how capable you are before he communicates 
with the elves.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3873"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Did you climb 
all the way up here just to tell me that?” Eragon asked, thinking of Vol 
Turin’s length.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3874"><span class="calibre_class_4">Nasuada shook 
her head. “I used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels. 
We could have sent the message with signals, but I decided to bring it myself 
and meet you in person.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3875"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Would you like 
to sit down?” asked Eragon. He motioned toward Saphira’s cave.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3876"><span class="calibre_class_4">Nasuada laughed 
lightly. “No, I am expected elsewhere. You should also know, my father decreed 
that you may visit Murtagh, if you wish.” A somber expression disturbed her 
previously smooth features. “I met Murtagh earlier. . . . He’s anxious to speak 
with you. He seemed lonely; you should visit him.” She gave Eragon directions 
to Murtagh’s cell.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3877"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon thanked 
her for the news, then asked, “What about Arya? Is she better? Can I see her? 
Orik wasn’t able to tell me much.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3878"><span class="calibre_class_4">She smiled 
mischievously. “Arya is recovering swiftly, as all elves do. No one is allowed 
to see her except my father, Hrothgar, and the healers. They have spent much 
time with her, learning all that occurred during her imprisonment.” She swept 
her eyes over Saphira. “I must go now. Is there anything you would have me 
convey to Ajihad on your behalf?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3879"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No, except a 
desire to visit Arya. And give him my thanks for the hospitality he’s shown 
us.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3880"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I will take 
your words directly to him. Farewell, Rider Eragon. I hope we shall soon meet 
again.” She curtsied and exited the dragonhold, head held high.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3881"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">If she really came 
all the way up Tronjheim just to meet me—pulleys or no pulleys—there was more 
to this meeting than idle chatter,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_41">remarked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3882"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Aye,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Saphira, 
withdrawing her head into the cave. Eragon climbed up to her and was surprised 
to see Solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck. The werecat 
was purring deeply, his black-tipped tail flicking back and forth. The two of 
them looked at Eragon impudently, as if to ask, “What?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3883"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon shook his 
head, laughing helplessly.<i>Saphira, is Solembum who you wanted to meet?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3884"><span class="calibre_class_4">They both 
blinked at him and answered,<i>Yes.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3885"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Just wondering,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he said, mirth 
still bubbling inside him. It made sense that they would befriend each 
other—their personalities were similar, and they were both creatures of magic. 
He sighed, releasing some of the day’s tension as he unbuckled Zar’roc.<i>Solembum, 
do you know where Angela is? I couldn’t find her, and I need her advice.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3886"><span class="calibre_class_4">Solembum kneaded 
his paws against Saphira’s scaled back.<i>She is somewhere in Tronjheim.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3887"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">When will she 
return?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3888"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Soon.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3889"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">How soon?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he asked 
impatiently.<i>I need to talk to her today.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3890"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Not that soon.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3891"><span class="calibre_class_4">The werecat 
refused to say more, despite Eragon’s persistent questions. He gave up and 
nestled against Saphira. Solembum’s purring was a low thrum above his head.<i>I 
have to visit Murtagh tomorrow,</i> he thought, fingering Brom’s ring.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3892"><a name="c56" id="c56"><span class="calibre_class_4">A</span></a><span class="calibre_class_4"> </span><span class="calibre_class_25">RYA</span><span class="calibre_class_4">’</span><span class="calibre_class_25">S</span><span class="calibre_class_4">T</span><span class="calibre_class_25">EST</span><span class="calibre_class_4"><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3893"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_155">O</span><span class="calibre_class_4">n the morning of 
their third day in Tronjheim, Eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized. 
He belted Zar’roc to his waist and slung his bow and half-full quiver across 
his back. After a leisurely flight inside Farthen Dûr with Saphira, he met Orik 
by one of Tronjheim’s four main gates. Eragon asked him about Nasuada.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3894"><span class="calibre_class_4">“An unusual 
girl,” answered Orik, glancing disapprovingly at Zar’roc. “She’s totally 
devoted to her father and spends all her time helping him. I think she does 
more for Ajihad than he knows—there have been times when she’s maneuvered his 
enemies without ever revealing her part in it.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3895"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Who is her 
mother?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3896"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That I don’t 
know. Ajihad was alone when he brought Nasuada to Farthen Dûr as a newborn 
child. He’s never said where he and Nasuada came from.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3897"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">So she too grew 
up without knowing her mother.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_41">He shook off the thought. “I’m restless. 
It’ll be good to use my muscles. Where should I go for this ‘testing’ of 
Ajihad’s?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3898"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik pointed out 
into Farthen Dûr. “The training field is half a mile from Tronjheim, though you 
can’t see it from here because it’s behind the city-mountain. It’s a large area 
where both dwarves and humans practice.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3899"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I’m coming as 
well,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">stated 
Saphira.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3900"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon told 
Orik, and the dwarf tugged on his beard. “That might not be a good idea. There 
are many people at the training field; you will be sure to attract attention.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3901"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira growled 
loudly.<i>I will come!</i> And that settled the matter.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3902"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3903"><span class="calibre_class_4">The unruly 
clatter of fighting reached them from the field: the loud clang of steel 
clashing on steel, the solid thump of arrows striking padded targets, the 
rattle and crack of wooden staves, and the shouts of men in mock battle. The 
noise was confusing, yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3904"><span class="calibre_class_4">The bulk of the 
training ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling 
with shields and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves. They drilled as a group 
in formations. Practicing beside them were hundreds of individual warriors 
outfitted with swords, maces, spears, staves, flails, shields of all shapes and 
sizes, and even, Eragon saw, someone with a pitchfork. Nearly all the fighters 
wore armor, usually chain mail and a helmet; plate armor was not as common. 
There were as many dwarves as humans, though the two kept mainly to themselves. 
Behind the sparring warriors, a broad line of archers fired steadily at gray 
sackcloth dummies.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3905"><span class="calibre_class_4">Before Eragon 
had time to wonder what he was supposed to do, a bearded man, his head and 
blocky shoulders covered by a mail coif, strode over to them. The rest of him 
was protected by a rough oxhide suit that still had hair on it. A huge 
sword—almost as long as Eragon—hung across his broad back. He ran a quick eye 
over Saphira and Eragon, as if evaluating how dangerous they were, then said 
gruffly, “Knurla Orik. You’ve been gone too long. There’s nobody left for me to 
spar with.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3906"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik smiled. 
“Oeí, that’s because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster 
sword.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3907"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Everyone except 
you,” he corrected.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3908"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That’s because 
I’m faster than a giant like you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3909"><span class="calibre_class_4">The man looked 
at Eragon again. “I’m Fredric. I’ve been told to find out what you can do. How 
strong are you?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3910"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Strong enough,” 
answered Eragon. “I have to be in order to fight with magic.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3911"><span class="calibre_class_4">Fredric shook 
his head; the coif clinked like a bag of coins. “Magic has no place in what we 
do here. Unless you’ve served in an army, I doubt any fights you’ve been in 
lasted more than a few minutes. What we’re concerned about is how you’ll be 
able to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours, or even weeks if it’s a 
siege. Do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3912"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon thought 
about it. “Only my fists.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3913"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Good answer!” 
laughed Fredric. “Well, we’ll start you off with the bow and see how you do. 
Then once some space has cleared up on the field, we’ll try—” He broke off 
suddenly and stared past Eragon, scowling angrily.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3914"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Twins 
stalked toward them, their bald heads pale against their purple robes. Orik 
muttered something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his 
belt. “I told you two to stay away from the training area,” said Fredric, 
stepping forward threateningly. The Twins seemed frail before his bulk.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3915"><span class="calibre_class_4">They looked at 
him arrogantly. “We were ordered by Ajihad to test Eragon’s proficiency with 
magic—<i>before</i>you exhaust him banging on pieces of metal.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3916"><span class="calibre_class_4">Fredric 
glowered. “Why can’t someone else test him?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3917"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No one else is 
powerful enough,” sniffed the Twins. Saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them. 
A line of smoke trickled from her nostrils, but they ignored her. “Come with 
us,” they ordered, and strode to an empty corner of the field.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3918"><span class="calibre_class_4">Shrugging, 
Eragon followed with Saphira. Behind him he heard Fredric say to Orik, “We have 
to stop them from going too far.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3919"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I know,” 
answered Orik in a low voice, “but I can’t interfere again. Hrothgar made it 
clear he won’t be able to protect me the next time it happens.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3920"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon forced 
back his growing apprehension. The Twins might know more techniques and words. 
. . . Still, he remembered what Brom had told him: Riders were stronger in 
magic than ordinary men. But would that be enough to resist the combined power 
of the Twins?<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3921"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Don’t worry so 
much; I will help you,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_36">said Saphira.<i>There are two of us as well.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3922"><span class="calibre_class_4">He touched her 
gently on the leg, relieved by her words. The Twins looked at Eragon and asked, 
“And how do you answer us, Eragon?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3923"><span class="calibre_class_4">Overlooking the 
puzzled expressions of his companions, he said flatly, “No.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3924"><span class="calibre_class_4">Sharp lines 
appeared at the corners of the Twins’ mouths. They turned so they faced Eragon 
obliquely and, bending at the waists, drew a large pentagram on the ground. 
They stepped in the middle of it, then said harshly, “We begin now. You will 
attempt to complete the tasks we assign you . . . that is all.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3925"><span class="calibre_class_4">One of the Twins 
reached into his robe, produced a polished rock the size of Eragon’s fist, and 
set it on the ground. “Lift it to eye level.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3926"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">That’s easy 
enough,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">commented 
Eragon to Saphira. “Stenr reisa!” The rock wobbled, then smoothly rose from the 
ground. Before it went more than a foot, an unexpected resistance halted it in 
midair. A smile touched the Twins’ lips. Eragon stared at them, enraged—they 
were trying to make him fail! If he became exhausted now, it would be 
impossible to complete the harder tasks. Obviously they were confident that 
their combined strength could easily wear him down.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3927"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">But I’m not 
alone either,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">snarled 
Eragon to himself.<i>Saphira, now!</i> Her mind melded with his, and the rock 
jerked through the air to stop, quivering, at eye level. The Twins’ eyes 
narrowed cruelly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3928"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Very . . . 
good,” they hissed. Fredric looked unnerved by the display of magic. “Now move 
the stone in a circle.” Again Eragon struggled against their efforts to stop 
him, and again—to their obvious anger—he prevailed. The exercises quickly 
increased in complexity and difficulty until Eragon was forced to think 
carefully about which words to use. And each time, the Twins fought him 
bitterly, though the strain never showed on their faces.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3929"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was only with 
Saphira’s support that Eragon was able to hold his ground. In a break between 
two of the tasks, he asked her,<i>Why do they continue this testing? Our 
abilities were clear enough from what they saw in my mind.</i> She cocked her 
head thoughtfully.<i>You know what?</i> he said grimly as comprehension came to 
him.<i>They’re using this as an opportunity to figure out what ancient words I 
know and perhaps learn new ones themselves.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3930"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Speak softly 
then, so that they cannot hear you, and use the simplest words possible.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3931"><span class="calibre_class_4">From then on, 
Eragon used only a handful of basic words to complete the tasks. But finding 
ways to make them perform in the same manner as a long sentence or phrase stretched 
his ingenuity to the limit. He was rewarded by the frustration that contorted 
the Twins’ faces as he foiled them again and again. No matter what they tried, 
they could not get him to use any more words in the ancient language.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3932"><span class="calibre_class_4">More than an 
hour passed, but the Twins showed no sign of stopping. Eragon was hot and 
thirsty, but refrained from asking for a reprieve—he would continue as long as 
they did. There were many tests: manipulating water, casting fire, scrying, 
juggling rocks, hardening leather, freezing items, controlling the flight of an 
arrow, and healing scratches. He wondered how long it would take for the Twins 
to run out of ideas.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3933"><span class="calibre_class_4">Finally the 
Twins raised their hands and said, “There is only one thing left to do. It is 
simple enough—any<i>competent</i> user of magic should find this easy.” One of 
them removed a silver ring from his finger and smugly handed it to Eragon. 
“Summon the essence of silver.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3934"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon stared at 
the ring in confusion. What was he supposed to do? The essence of silver, what 
was that? And how was it to be summoned? Saphira had no idea, and the Twins 
were not going to help. He had never learned silver’s name in the ancient 
language, though he knew it had to be part of<i>argetlam.</i> In desperation he 
combined the only word that might work,<i>ethgrí,</i> or “invoke,” with<i>arget.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3935"><span class="calibre_class_4">Drawing himself 
upright, he gathered together what power he had left and parted his lips to 
deliver the invocation. Suddenly a clear, vibrant voice split the air.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3936"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Stop!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3937"><span class="calibre_class_4">The word rushed 
over Eragon like cool water—the voice was strangely familiar, like a 
half-remembered melody. The back of his neck tingled. He slowly turned toward 
its source.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3938"><span class="calibre_class_4">A lone figure 
stood behind them: Arya. A leather strip encircled her brow, restraining her 
voluminous black hair, which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous 
cascade. Her slender sword was at her hip, her bow on her back. Plain black 
leather clothed her shapely frame, poor raiment for one so fair. She was taller 
than most men, and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed. An unmarked 
face reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3939"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya’s blazing 
emerald eyes were fixed on the Twins, who had turned pale with fright. She 
approached on silent footsteps and said in soft, menacing tones, “Shame! Shame 
to ask of him what only a master can do. Shame that you should use such 
methods. Shame that you told Ajihad you didn’t know Eragon’s abilities. He is 
competent. Now leave!” Arya frowned dangerously, her slanted eyebrows meeting 
like lightning bolts in a sharp V, and pointed at the ring in Eragon’s hand. 
“Arget!” she exclaimed thunderously.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3940"><span class="calibre_class_4">The silver 
shimmered, and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it. The two 
were identical except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed white-hot. At 
the sight of it, the Twins spun on their heels and fled, robes flapping wildly. 
The insubstantial ring vanished from Eragon’s hand, leaving the circlet of 
silver behind. Orik and Fredric were on their feet, eyeing Arya warily. Saphira 
crouched, ready for action.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3941"><span class="calibre_class_4">The elf surveyed 
them all. Her angled eyes paused on Eragon. Then she turned and strode toward 
the heart of the training field. The warriors ceased their sparring and looked 
at her with wonder. Within a few moments the entire field fell silent in awe of 
her presence.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3942"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon was 
inexorably dragged forward by his own fascination. Saphira spoke, but he was 
oblivious to her comments. A large circle formed around Arya. Looking only at 
Eragon, she proclaimed, “I claim the right of trial by arms. Draw your sword.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3943"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">She means to 
duel me!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3944"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">But not, I 
think, to harm you,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">replied 
Saphira slowly. She nudged him with her nose.<i>Go and acquit yourself well. I 
will watch.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3945"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
reluctantly stepped forward. He did not want to do this when he was exhausted 
from magic use and when there were so many people watching. Besides, Arya could 
be in no shape for sparring. It had only been two days since she had received 
Túnivor’s Nectar.<i>I will soften my blows so I don’t hurt her,</i> he decided.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3946"><span class="calibre_class_4">They faced each 
other across the circle of warriors. Arya drew her sword with her left hand. 
The weapon was thinner than Eragon’s, but just as long and sharp. He slid 
Zar’roc out of its polished sheath and held the red blade point-down by his 
side. For a long moment they stood motionless, elf and human watching each 
other. It flashed through Eragon’s mind that this was how many of his fights 
with Brom had started.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3947"><span class="calibre_class_4">He moved forward 
cautiously. With a blur of motion Arya jumped at him, slashing at his ribs. 
Eragon reflexively parried the attack, and their swords met in a shower of 
sparks. Zar’roc was batted aside as if it were no more than a fly. The elf did 
not take advantage of the opening, however, but spun to her right, hair 
whipping through the air, and struck at his other side. He barely stopped the blow 
and backpedaled frantically, stunned by her ferocity and speed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3948"><span class="calibre_class_4">Belatedly, 
Eragon remembered Brom’s warning that even the weakest elf could easily 
overpower a human. He had about as much chance of defeating Arya as he did 
Durza. She attacked again, swinging at his head. He ducked under the 
razor-sharp edge. But then why was she . . .<i>toying</i> with him? For a few 
long seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it, then he 
realized,<i>She wants to know how proficient I am.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3949"><span class="calibre_class_4">Understanding 
that, he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew. He flowed from 
one pose to another, recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible 
way. But no matter how inventive he was, Arya’s sword always stopped his. She 
matched his actions with effortless grace.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3950"><span class="calibre_class_4">Engaged in a 
fiery dance, their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades. At 
times they nearly touched, taut skin only a hair’s breadth away, but then 
momentum would whirl them apart, and they would withdraw for a second, only to 
join again. Their sinuous forms wove together like twisting ropes of windblown 
smoke.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3951"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon could 
never remember how long they fought. It was timeless, filled with nothing but 
action and reaction. Zar’roc grew leaden in his hand; his arm burned 
ferociously with each stroke. At last, as he lunged forward, Arya nimbly 
sidestepped, sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with 
supernatural speed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3952"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon froze as 
the icy metal touched his skin. His muscles trembled from the exertion. Dimly 
he heard Saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them. Arya 
lowered her sword and sheathed it. “You have passed,” she said quietly amid the 
noise.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3953"><span class="calibre_class_4">Dazed, he slowly 
straightened. Fredric was beside him now, thumping his back enthusiastically. 
“That was incredible swordsmanship! I even learned some new moves from watching 
the two of you. And the elf—stunning!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3954"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">But I lost,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he protested 
silently. Orik praised his performance with a broad smile, but all Eragon 
noticed was Arya, standing alone and silent. She motioned slightly with a 
finger, no more than a twitch, toward a knoll about a mile from the practice 
field, then turned and walked away. The crowd melted before her. A hush fell 
over the men and dwarves as she passed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3955"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon turned to 
Orik. “I have to go. I’ll return to the dragonhold soon.” With a swift jab, 
Eragon sheathed Zar’roc and pulled himself onto Saphira. She took off over the 
training field, which turned into a sea of faces as everyone looked at her.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3956"><span class="calibre_class_4">As they soared 
toward the knoll, Eragon saw Arya running below them with clean, easy strides. 
Saphira commented,<i>You find her form pleasing, do you not?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3957"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he admitted, 
blushing.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3958"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Her face does 
have more character than that of most humans,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_11">she sniffed.<i>But it’s long, 
like a horse’s, and overall she’s rather shapeless.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3959"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon looked at 
Saphira with amazement.<i>You’re jealous, aren’t you!</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3960"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Impossible. I 
never get jealous,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">she 
said, offended.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3961"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">You are now, 
admit it!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he 
laughed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3962"><span class="calibre_class_4">She snapped her 
jaws together loudly.<i>I am not!</i> He smiled and shook his head, but let her 
denial stand. She landed heavily on the knoll, jostling him roughly. He jumped 
down without remarking on it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3963"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya was close 
behind them. Her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner Eragon had 
seen. When she reached the top of the knoll, her breathing was smooth and 
regular. Suddenly tongue-tied, Eragon dropped his gaze. She strode past him and 
said to Saphira, “Skulblaka, eka celöbra ono un mulabra ono un onr Shur’tugal 
né haina. Atra nosu waíse fricai.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3964"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon did not 
recognize most of the words, but Saphira obviously understood the message. She 
shuffled her wings and surveyed Arya curiously. Then she nodded, humming 
deeply. Arya smiled. “I am glad that you recovered,” Eragon said. “We didn’t 
know if you would live or not.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3965"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That is why I 
came here today,” said Arya, facing him. Her rich voice was accented and 
exotic. She spoke clearly, with a hint of trill, as if she were about to sing. 
“I owe you a debt that must be repaid. You saved my life. That can never be 
forgotten.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3966"><span class="calibre_class_4">“It—it was 
nothing,” said Eragon, fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true, 
even as he spoke them. Embarrassed, he changed the subject. “How did you come 
to be in Gil’ead?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3967"><span class="calibre_class_4">Pain shadowed 
Arya’s face. She looked away into the distance. “Let us walk.” They descended from 
the knoll and meandered toward Farthen Dûr. Eragon respected Arya’s silence as 
they walked. Saphira padded quietly beside them. Finally Arya lifted her head 
and said with the grace of her kind, “Ajihad told me you were present when 
Saphira’s egg appeared.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3968"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes.” For the 
first time, Eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the 
egg over the dozens of leagues that separated Du Weldenvarden from the Spine. 
To even attempt such a feat was courting disaster, if not death.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3969"><span class="calibre_class_4">Her next words 
were heavy. “Then know this: at the moment you first beheld it, I was captured 
by Durza.” Her voice filled with bitterness and grief. “It was he who led the 
Urgals that ambushed and slew my companions, Faolin and Glenwing. Somehow he 
knew where to wait for us—we had no warning. I was drugged and transported to 
Gil’ead. There, Durza was charged by Galbatorix to learn where I had sent the 
egg and all I knew of Ellesméra.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3970"><span class="calibre_class_4">She stared ahead 
icily, jaw clenched. “He tried for months without success. His methods were . . 
. harsh. When torture failed, he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would. 
Fortunately, I still had the strength to nudge their minds and make them 
incapable. At last Galbatorix ordered that I was to be brought to Urû’baen. 
Dread filled me when I learned this, as I was weary in both mind and body and 
had no strength to resist him. If it were not for you, I would have stood 
before Galbatorix in a week’s time.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3971"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon shuddered 
inwardly. It was amazing what she had survived. The memory of her injuries was 
still vivid in his mind. Softly, he asked, “Why do you tell me all this?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3972"><span class="calibre_class_4">“So that you 
know what I was saved from. Do not presume I can ignore your deed.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3973"><span class="calibre_class_4">Humbled, he 
bowed his head. “What will you do now—return to Ellesméra?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3974"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No, not yet. 
There is much that must be done here. I cannot abandon the Varden—Ajihad needs 
my help. I’ve seen you tested in both arms and magic today. Brom taught you 
well. You are ready to proceed in your training.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3975"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You mean for me 
to go to Ellesméra?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3976"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3977"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon felt a 
flash of irritation. Did he and Saphira have no say in the matter? “When?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3978"><span class="calibre_class_4">“That is yet to 
be decided, but not for some weeks.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3979"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">At least they 
gave us that much time,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_36">thought Eragon. Saphira mentioned something to him, 
and he in turn asked Arya, “What did the Twins want me to do?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3980"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya’s sculpted 
lip curled with disgust. “Something not even they can accomplish. It is 
possible to speak the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its 
true form. It takes years of work and great discipline, but the reward is 
complete control over the object. That is why one’s true name is always kept 
hidden, for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts, they could 
dominate you utterly.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3981"><span class="calibre_class_4">“It’s strange,” 
said Eragon after a moment, “but before I was captured at Gil’ead, I had 
visions of you in my dreams. It was like scrying—and I was able to scry you 
later—but it was always during my sleep.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3982"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya pursed her 
lips pensively. “There were times I felt as if another presence was watching 
me, but I was often confused and feverish. I’ve never heard of anyone, either 
in lore or legend, being able to scry in their sleep.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3983"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I don’t 
understand it myself,” said Eragon, looking at his hands. He twirled Brom’s 
ring around his finger. “What does the tattoo on your shoulder mean? I didn’t 
mean to see it, but when I was healing your wounds . . . it couldn’t be helped. 
It’s just like the symbol on this ring.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3984"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You have a ring 
with the yawë on it?” she asked sharply.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3985"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes. It was 
Brom’s. See?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3986"><span class="calibre_class_4">He held out the 
ring. Arya examined the sapphire, then said, “This is a token given only to the 
most valued elf-friends—so valued, in fact, it has not been used in centuries. 
Or so I thought. I never knew that Queen Islanzadi thought so highly of Brom.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3987"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I shouldn’t 
wear it, then,” said Eragon, afraid that he had been presumptuous.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3988"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No, keep it. It 
will give you protection if you meet my people by chance, and it may help you 
gain favor with the queen. Tell no one of my tattoo. It should not be 
revealed.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3989"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Very well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3990"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3991"><span class="calibre_class_4">He enjoyed 
talking with Arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer. When 
they parted, he wandered through Farthen Dûr, conversing with Saphira. Despite 
his prodding, she refused to tell him what Arya had said to her. Eventually his 
thoughts turned to Murtagh and then to Nasuada’s advice.<i>I’ll get something 
to eat, then go see him,</i> he decided.<i>Will you wait for me so I can return 
to the dragonhold with you?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3992"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I will wait—go,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">said Saphira.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3993"><span class="calibre_class_4">With a grateful 
smile, Eragon dashed to Tronjheim, ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen, then 
followed Nasuada’s instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a 
man and a dwarf. When he requested entrance, the dwarf banged on the door three 
times, then unbolted it. “Just holler when you want to leave,” said the man 
with a friendly smile.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3994"><span class="calibre_class_4">The cell was 
warm and well lit, with a washbasin in one corner and a writing desk—equipped 
with quills and ink—in another. The ceiling was extensively carved with 
lacquered figures; the floor was covered with a plush rug. Murtagh lay on a 
stout bed, reading a scroll. He looked up in surprise and exclaimed cheerily, 
“Eragon! I’d hoped you would come!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3995"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How did . . . I 
mean I thought—”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3996"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You thought I 
was stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack,” said Murtagh, rolling upright 
with a grin. “Actually, I expected the same thing, but Ajihad lets me have all 
this as long as I don’t cause trouble. And they bring me huge meals, as well as 
anything I want from the library. If I’m not careful, I’ll turn into a fat 
scholar.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3997"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon laughed, 
and with a wondering smile seated himself next to Murtagh. “But aren’t you 
angry? You’re still a prisoner.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3998"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Oh, I was at 
first,” said Murtagh with a shrug. “But the more I thought about it, the more I 
came to realize that this is really the best place for me. Even if Ajihad gave 
me my freedom, I would stay in my room most of the time anyway.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_3999"><span class="calibre_class_4">“But why?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4000"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You know well 
enough. No one would be at ease around me, knowing my true identity, and there 
would always be people who wouldn’t limit themselves to harsh looks or words. 
But enough of that, I’m eager to know what’s new. Come, tell me.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4001"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon recounted 
the events of the past two days, including his encounter with the Twins in the 
library. When he finished, Murtagh leaned back reflectively. “I suspect,” he 
said, “that Arya is more important than either of us thought. Consider what 
you’ve learned: she is a master of the sword, powerful in magic, and, most 
significantly, was chosen to guard Saphira’s egg. She cannot be ordinary, even 
among the elves.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4002"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon agreed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4003"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh stared 
at the ceiling. “You know, I find this imprisonment oddly peaceful. For once in 
my life I don’t have to be afraid. I know I ought to be . . . yet something 
about this place puts me at ease. A good night’s sleep helps, too.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4004"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I know what you 
mean,” said Eragon wryly. He moved to a softer place on the bed. “Nasuada said 
that she visited you. Did she say anything interesting?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4005"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh’s gaze 
shifted into the distance, and he shook his head. “No, she only wanted to meet 
me. Doesn’t she look like a princess? And the way she carries herself! When she 
first entered through that doorway, I thought she was one of the great ladies 
of Galbatorix’s court. I’ve seen earls and counts who had wives that, compared 
to her, were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4006"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon listened 
to his praise with growing apprehension.<i>It may mean nothing,</i> he reminded 
himself.<i>You’re leaping to conclusions.</i> Yet the foreboding would not 
leave him. Trying to shake off the feeling, he asked, “How long are you going 
to remain imprisoned, Murtagh? You can’t hide forever.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4007"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh shrugged 
carelessly, but there was weight behind his words. “For now I’m content to stay 
and rest. There’s no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself 
to the Twins’ examination. No doubt I’ll tire of this eventually, but for now . 
. . I am content.”<p/></span></p>

Eragon with a sharp rap of her snout, bruising him with her hard jaw. “Ouch!” 
he exclaimed, sitting upright. The cave was dark except for a faint glow 
emanating from the shuttered lantern. Outside in the dragonhold, Isidar Mithrim 
glittered with a thousand different colors, illuminated by its girdle of 
lanterns.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4010"><span class="calibre_class_4">An agitated 
dwarf stood in the entrance to the cave, wringing his hands. “You must come, 
Argetlam! Great trouble—Ajihad summons you. There is no time!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4011"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What’s wrong?” 
asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4012"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarf only 
shook his head, beard wagging. “Go, you must! Carkna bragha! Now!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4013"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon belted on 
Zar’roc, grabbed his bow and arrows, then strapped the saddle onto Saphira.<i>So 
much for a good night’s sleep,</i> she groused, crouching low to the floor so 
he could clamber onto her back. He yawned loudly as Saphira launched herself 
from the cave.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4014"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik was waiting 
for them with a grim expression when they landed at Tronjheim’s gates. “Come, 
the others are waiting.” He led them through Tronjheim to Ajihad’s study. On 
the way, Eragon plied him with questions, but Orik would only say, “I don’t know 
enough myself—wait until you hear Ajihad.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4015"><span class="calibre_class_4">The large study 
door was opened by a pair of burly guards. Ajihad stood behind his desk, 
bleakly inspecting a map. Arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well. 
Ajihad looked up. “Good, you’re here, Eragon. Meet Jörmundur, my second in 
command.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4016"><span class="calibre_class_4">They 
acknowledged each other, then turned their attention to Ajihad. “I roused the 
five of you because we are all in grave danger. About half an hour ago a dwarf 
ran out of an abandoned tunnel under Tronjheim. He was bleeding and nearly 
incoherent, but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what was pursuing 
him: an army of Urgals, maybe a day’s march from here.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4017"><span class="calibre_class_4">Shocked silence 
filled the study. Then Jörmundur swore explosively and began asking questions 
at the same time Orik did. Arya remained silent. Ajihad raised his hands. 
“Quiet! There is more. The Urgals aren’t approaching<i>over</i> land, but<i>under</i> 
it. They’re in the tunnels . . . we’re going to be attacked from below.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4018"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon raised 
his voice in the din that followed. “Why didn’t the dwarves know about this 
sooner? How did the Urgals find the tunnels?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4019"><span class="calibre_class_4">“We’re lucky to 
know about it this early!” bellowed Orik. Everyone stopped talking to hear him. 
“There are hundreds of tunnels throughout the Beor Mountains, uninhabited since 
the day they were mined. The only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who 
don’t want contact with anyone. We could have just as easily received no 
warning at all.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4020"><span class="calibre_class_4">Ajihad pointed 
at the map, and Eragon moved closer. The map depicted the southern half of 
Alagaësia, but unlike Eragon’s, it showed the entire Beor Mountain range in 
detail. Ajihad’s finger was on the section of the Beor Mountains that touched 
Surda’s eastern border. “This,” he said, “is where the dwarf claimed to have 
come from.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4021"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Orthíad!” 
exclaimed Orik. At Jörmundur’s puzzled inquiry, he explained, “It’s an ancient 
dwelling of ours that was deserted when Tronjheim was completed. During its 
time it was the greatest of our cities. But no one’s lived there for 
centuries.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4022"><span class="calibre_class_4">“And it’s old 
enough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed,” said Ajihad. “That’s how we 
surmise it was discovered from the surface. I suspect that Orthíad is now being 
called Ithrö Zhâda. That’s where the Urgal column that was chasing Eragon and 
Saphira was supposed to go, and I’m sure it’s where the Urgals have been 
migrating all year. From Ithrö Zhâda they can travel anywhere they want in the 
Beor Mountains. They have the power to destroy both the Varden and the 
dwarves.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4023"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jörmundur bent 
over the map, eyeing it carefully. “Do you know how many Urgals there are? Are 
Galbatorix’s troops with them? We can’t plan a defense without knowing how 
large their army is.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4024"><span class="calibre_class_4">Ajihad replied 
unhappily, “We’re unsure about both those things, yet our survival rests on 
that last question. If Galbatorix has augmented the Urgals’ ranks with his own 
men, we don’t stand a chance. But if he hasn’t—because he still doesn’t want 
his alliance with the Urgals revealed, or for some other reason—it’s possible 
we can win. Neither Orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour. Even so, 
I sent runners to both of them with news of our plight. At the very least they 
won’t be caught by surprise if we fall.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4025"><span class="calibre_class_4">He drew a hand 
across his coal-black brow. “I’ve already talked with Hrothgar, and we’ve 
decided on a course of action. Our only hope is to contain the Urgals in three 
of the larger tunnels and channel them into Farthen Dûr so they don’t swarm 
inside Tronjheim like locusts.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4026"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I need you, 
Eragon and Arya, to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels. The job is 
too big for normal means. Two groups of dwarves are already working on it: one 
outside Tronjheim, the other beneath it. Eragon, you’re to work with the group 
outside. Arya, you’ll be with the one underground; Orik will guide you to them.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4027"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Why not 
collapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched?” asked 
Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4028"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Because,” said 
Orik, “that would force the Urgals to clear away the rubble, and they might 
decide to go in a direction we don’t want them to. Plus, if we cut ourselves 
off, they could attack other dwarf cities—which we wouldn’t be able to assist 
in time.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4029"><span class="calibre_class_4">“There’s also 
another reason,” said Ajihad. “Hrothgar warned me that Tronjheim sits on such a 
dense network of tunnels that if too many are weakened, sections of the city 
will sink into the ground under their own weight. We can’t risk that.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4030"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jörmundur 
listened intently, then asked, “So there won’t be any fighting inside 
Tronjheim? You said the Urgals would be channeled outside the city, into 
Farthen Dûr.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4031"><span class="calibre_class_4">Ajihad responded 
quickly, “That’s right. We can’t defend Tronjheim’s entire perimeter—it’s too 
big for our forces—so we’re going to seal all the passageways and gates leading 
into it. That will force the Urgals out onto the flats surrounding Tronjheim, where 
there’s plenty of maneuvering room for our armies. Since the Urgals have access 
to the tunnels, we cannot risk an extended battle. As long as they are here, we 
will be in constant danger of them quarrying up through Tronjheim’s floor. If 
that happens, we’ll be trapped, attacked from both the outside and inside. We 
have to prevent the Urgals from taking Tronjheim. If they secure it, it’s 
doubtful we will have the strength to roust them.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4032"><span class="calibre_class_4">“And what of our 
families?” asked Jörmundur. “I won’t see my wife and son murdered by Urgals.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4033"><span class="calibre_class_4">The lines 
deepened on Ajihad’s face. “All the women and children are being evacuated into 
the surrounding valleys. If we are defeated, they have guides who will take 
them to Surda. That’s all I can do, under the circumstances.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4034"><span class="calibre_class_4">Jörmundur 
struggled to hide his relief. “Sir, is Nasuada going as well?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4035"><span class="calibre_class_4">“She is not 
pleased, but yes.” All eyes were on Ajihad as he squared his shoulders and 
announced, “The Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours. We know their numbers 
are great, but we<i>must</i> hold Farthen Dûr. Failure will mean the dwarves’ 
downfall, death to the Varden—and eventual defeat for Surda and the elves. This 
is one battle we cannot lose. Now go and complete your tasks! Jörmundur, ready 
the men to fight.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4036"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4037"><span class="calibre_class_4">They left the 
study and scattered: Jörmundur to the barracks, Orik and Arya to the stairs 
leading underground, and Eragon and Saphira down one of Tronjheim’s four main 
halls. Despite the early hour, the city-mountain swarmed like an anthill. 
People were running, shouting messages, and carrying bundles of belongings.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4038"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon had 
fought and killed before, but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear 
into his chest. He had never had a chance to anticipate a fight. Now that he 
did, it filled him with dread. He was confident when facing only a few 
opponents—he knew he could easily defeat three or four Urgals with Zar’roc and 
magic—but in a large conflict, anything could happen.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4039"><span class="calibre_class_4">They exited 
Tronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help. Without the 
sun or moon, the inside of Farthen Dûr was dark as lampblack, punctuated by 
glittering lanterns bobbing jerkily in the crater.<i>Perhaps they’re on the far 
side of Tronjheim,</i> suggested Saphira. Eragon agreed and swung onto her 
back.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4040"><span class="calibre_class_4">They glided 
around Tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight. Saphira angled 
toward them, then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled 
dwarves who were busy digging with pickaxes. Eragon quickly explained why he 
was there. A sharp-nosed dwarf told him, “There’s a tunnel about four yards 
directly underneath us. Any help you could give us would be appreciated.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4041"><span class="calibre_class_4">“If you clear 
the area over the tunnel, I’ll see what I can do.” The sharp-nosed dwarf looked 
doubtful, but ordered the diggers off the site.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4042"><span class="calibre_class_4">Breathing slowly, 
Eragon prepared to use magic. It might be possible to actually move all the 
dirt off the tunnel, but he needed to conserve his strength for later. Instead, 
he would try to collapse the tunnel by applying force to weak sections of its 
ceiling.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4043"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Thrysta deloi,” 
he whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil. Almost immediately they 
encountered rock. He ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the 
hollow emptiness of the tunnel. Then he began searching for flaws in the rock. 
Every time he found one, he pushed on it, elongating and widening it. It was 
strenuous work, but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand. 
He made no visible progress—a fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4044"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
persevered. Before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be 
heard clearly on the surface. There was a persistent screech, then the ground 
slid inward like water draining from a tub, leaving a gaping hole seven yards 
across.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4045"><span class="calibre_class_4">As the delighted 
dwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble, the sharp-nosed dwarf led Eragon to 
the next tunnel. This one was much more difficult to collapse, but he managed 
to duplicate the feat. Over the next few hours, he collapsed over a half-dozen 
tunnels throughout Farthen Dûr, with Saphira’s help.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4046"><span class="calibre_class_4">Light crept into 
the small patch of sky above them as he worked. It was not enough to see by, 
but it bolstered Eragon’s confidence. He turned away from the crumpled ruins of 
the latest tunnel and surveyed the land with interest.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4047"><span class="calibre_class_4">A mass exodus of 
women and children, along with the Varden’s elders, streamed out of Tronjheim. 
Everyone carried loads of provisions, clothes, and belongings. A small group of 
warriors, predominantly boys and old men, accompanied them.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4048"><span class="calibre_class_4">Most of the 
activity, however, was at the base of Tronjheim, where the Varden and dwarves 
were assembling their army, which was divided into three battalions. Each 
section bore the Varden’s standard: a white dragon holding a rose above a sword 
pointing downward on a purple field.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4049"><span class="calibre_class_4">The men were silent, 
ironfisted. Their hair flowed loosely from under their helmets. Many warriors 
had only a sword and a shield, but there were several ranks of spear- and 
pikemen. In the rear of the battalions, archers tested their bowstrings.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4050"><span class="calibre_class_4">The dwarves were 
garbed in heavy battle gear. Burnished steel hauberks hung to their knees, and 
thick roundshields, stamped with the crests of their clan, rested on their left 
arms. Short swords were sheathed at their waists, while in their right hands 
they carried mattocks or war axes. Their legs were covered with extra-fine 
mail. They wore iron caps and brass-studded boots.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4051"><span class="calibre_class_4">A small figure 
detached itself from the far battalion and hurried toward Eragon and Saphira. 
It was Orik, clad like the other dwarves. “Ajihad wants you to join the army,” 
he said. “There are no more tunnels to cave in. Food is waiting for both of 
you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4052"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon and 
Saphira accompanied Orik to a tent, where they found bread and water for Eragon 
and a pile of dried meat for Saphira. They ate it without complaint; it was 
better than going hungry.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4053"><span class="calibre_class_4">When they 
finished, Orik told them to wait and disappeared into the battalion’s ranks. He 
returned, leading a line of dwarves burdened with tall piles of plate armor. 
Orik lifted a section of it and handed it to Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4054"><span class="calibre_class_4">“What is this?” 
asked Eragon, fingering the polished metal. The armor was intricately wrought 
with engraving and gold filigree. It was an inch thick in places and very 
heavy. No man could fight under that much weight. And there were far too many 
pieces for one person.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4055"><span class="calibre_class_4">“A gift from 
Hrothgar,” said Orik, looking pleased with himself. “It has lain so long among 
our other treasures that it was almost forgotten. It was forged in another age, 
before the fall of the Riders.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4056"><span class="calibre_class_4">“But what’s it<i>for</i> 
?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4057"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Why, it’s 
dragon armor, of course! You don’t think that dragons went into battle 
unprotected? Complete sets are rare because they took so long to make and 
because dragons were always growing. Still, Saphira isn’t too big yet, so this 
should fit her reasonably well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4058"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Dragon armor!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">As Saphira nosed 
one of the pieces, Eragon asked,<i>What do you think?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4059"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Let’s try it on,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">she said, a 
fierce gleam in her eye.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4060"><span class="calibre_class_4">After a good 
deal of struggling, Eragon and Orik stepped back to admire the result. 
Saphira’s entire neck—except for the spikes along its ridge—was covered with 
triangular scales of overlapping armor. Her belly and chest were protected by 
the heaviest plates, while the lightest ones were on her tail. Her legs and 
back were completely encased. Her wings were left bare. A single molded plate 
lay on top of her head, leaving her lower jaw free to bite and snap.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4061"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira arched 
her neck experimentally, and the armor flexed smoothly with her.<i>This will 
slow me down, but it’ll help stop the arrows. How do I look?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4062"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Very intimidating,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">replied Eragon 
truthfully. That pleased her.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4063"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik picked up 
the remaining items from the ground. “I brought you armor as well, though it 
took much searching to find your size. We rarely forge arms for men or elves. I 
don’t know who this was made for, but it has never been used and should serve 
you well.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4064"><span class="calibre_class_4">Over Eragon’s 
head went a stiff shirt of leather-backed mail that fell to his knees like a 
skirt. It rested heavily on his shoulders and clinked when he moved. He belted 
Zar’roc over it, which helped keep the mail from swinging. On his head went a 
leather cap, then a mail coif, and finally a gold-and-silver helm. Bracers were 
strapped to his forearms, and greaves to his lower legs. For his hands there 
were mail-backed gloves. Last, Orik handed him a broad shield emblazoned with 
an oak tree.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4065"><span class="calibre_class_4">Knowing that 
what he and Saphira had been given was worth several fortunes, Eragon bowed and 
said, “Thank you for these gifts. Hrothgar’s presents are greatly appreciated.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4066"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Don’t give 
thanks now,” said Orik with a chuckle. “Wait until the armor saves your life.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4067"><span class="calibre_class_4">The warriors 
around them began marching away. The three battalions were repositioning 
themselves in different parts of Farthen Dûr. Unsure of what they should do, 
Eragon looked at Orik, who shrugged and said, “I suppose we should accompany 
them.” They trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the crater wall. 
Eragon asked about the Urgals, but Orik only knew that scouts had been posted 
underground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4068"><span class="calibre_class_4">The battalion 
halted at one of the collapsed tunnels. The dwarves had piled the rubble so 
that anyone inside the tunnel could easily climb out.<i>This must be one of the 
places they’re going to force the Urgals to surface,</i> Saphira pointed out.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4069"><span class="calibre_class_4">Hundreds of 
lanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground. They provided a great 
pool of light that glowed like an evening sun. Fires blazed along the rim of 
the tunnel’s roof, huge cauldrons of pitch heating over them. Eragon looked 
away, fighting back revulsion. It was a terrible way to kill anyone, even an 
Urgal.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4070"><span class="calibre_class_4">Rows of 
sharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny 
barrier between the battalion and the tunnel. Eragon saw an opportunity to help 
and joined a group of men digging trenches between the saplings. Saphira 
assisted as well, scooping out the dirt with her giant claws. While they 
labored, Orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the 
archers. Eragon drank gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed 
around. After the trenches were finished and filled with pointed stakes, 
Saphira and Eragon rested.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4071"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik returned to 
find them seated together. He wiped his brow. “All the men and dwarves are on 
the battlefield. Tronjheim has been sealed off. Hrothgar has taken charge of 
the battalion to our left. Ajihad leads the one ahead of us.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4072"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Who commands 
this one?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4073"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Jörmundur.” 
Orik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4074"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira nudged 
Eragon.<i>Look.</i> His hand tightened on Zar’roc as he saw Murtagh, helmed, 
carrying a dwarven shield and his hand-and-a-half sword, approaching with 
Tornac.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4075"><span class="calibre_class_4">Orik cursed and 
leapt to his feet, but Murtagh said quickly, “It’s all right; Ajihad released 
me.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4076"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Why would he do 
that?” demanded Orik.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4077"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh smiled 
wryly. “He said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions. 
Apparently, he doesn’t think I would be able to do much damage even if I did 
turn on the Varden.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4078"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon nodded in 
welcome, relaxing his grip. Murtagh was an excellent and merciless 
fighter—exactly whom Eragon wanted by his side during battle.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4079"><span class="calibre_class_4">“How do we know 
you’re not lying?” asked Orik.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4080"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Because I say 
so,” announced a firm voice. Ajihad strode into their midst, armed for battle 
with a breastplate and an ivory-handled sword. He put a strong hand on Eragon’s 
shoulder and drew him away where the others could not hear. He cast an eye over 
Eragon’s armor. “Good, Orik outfitted you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4081"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes . . . has 
anything been seen in the tunnels?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4082"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Nothing.” 
Ajihad leaned on his sword. “One of the Twins is staying in Tronjheim. He’s 
going to watch the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his 
brother to me. I know you can speak with your mind. I need you to tell the 
Twins anything,<i>anything,</i> unusual that you see while fighting. Also, I’ll 
relay orders to you through them. Do you understand?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4083"><span class="calibre_class_4">The thought of 
being linked to the Twins filled Eragon with loathing, but he knew it was 
necessary. “I do.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4084"><span class="calibre_class_4">Ajihad paused. 
“You’re not a foot soldier or horseman, nor any other type of warrior I’m used 
to commanding. Battle may prove differently, but I think you and Saphira will 
be safer on the ground. In the air, you’ll be a choice target for Urgal 
archers. Will you fight from Saphira’s back?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4085"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon had never 
been in combat on horseback, much less on Saphira. “I’m not sure what we’ll do. 
When I’m on Saphira, I’m up too high to fight all but a Kull.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4086"><span class="calibre_class_4">“There will be 
plenty of Kull, I’m afraid,” said Ajihad. He straightened, pulling his sword 
out of the ground. “The only advice I can give you is to avoid unnecessary 
risks. The Varden cannot afford to lose you.” With that, he turned and left.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4087"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon returned 
to Orik and Murtagh and hunkered next to Saphira, leaning his shield against 
his knees. The four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors 
around them. Light from Farthen Dûr’s opening waned as the sun crept below the 
crater rim.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4088"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon turned to 
scan the encampment and froze, heart jolting. About thirty feet away sat Arya 
with her bow in her lap. Though he knew it was unreasonable, he had hoped she 
might accompany the other women out of Farthen Dûr. Concerned, he hastened to 
her. “You will fight?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4089"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I do what I 
must,” Arya said calmly.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4090"><span class="calibre_class_4">“But it’s too 
dangerous!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4091"><span class="calibre_class_4">Her face 
darkened. “Do not pamper me, human. Elves train both their men and women to 
fight. I am not one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is 
danger. I was given the task of protecting Saphira’s egg . . . which I failed. 
My breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if I did not guard you and 
Saphira on this field. You forget that I am stronger with magic than any here, 
including you. If the Shade comes, who can defeat him but me? And who else has 
the right?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4092"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon stared at 
her helplessly, knowing she was right and hating the fact. “Then stay safe.” Out 
of desperation, he added in the ancient language, “Wiol pömnuria ilian.” For my 
happiness.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4093"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya turned her 
gaze away uneasily, the fringe of her hair obscuring her face. She ran a hand 
along her polished bow, then murmured, “It is my wyrd to be here. The debt must 
be paid.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4094"><span class="calibre_class_4">He abruptly 
retreated to Saphira. Murtagh looked at him curiously. “What did she say?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4095"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Nothing.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4096"><span class="calibre_class_4">Wrapped in their 
own thoughts, the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled 
by. Farthen Dûr’s crater again grew black, except for the sanguine lantern glow 
and the fires heating the pitch. Eragon alternated between myopically examining 
the links of his mail and spying on Arya. Orik repeatedly ran a whetstone over 
the blade of his ax, periodically eyeing the edge between strokes; the rasp of 
metal on stone was irritating. Murtagh just stared into the distance.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4097"><span class="calibre_class_4">Occasionally, 
messengers ran through the encampment, causing the warriors to surge to their 
feet. But it always proved to be a false alarm. The men and dwarves became 
strained; angry voices were often heard. The worst part about Farthen Dûr was 
the lack of wind—the air was dead, motionless. Even when it grew warm and 
stifling and filled with smoke, there was no reprieve.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4098"><span class="calibre_class_4">As the night 
dragged on, the battlefield stilled, silent as death. Muscles stiffened from 
the waiting. Eragon stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids. He 
shook himself to alertness and tried to focus through his stupor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4099"><span class="calibre_class_4">Finally Orik 
said, “It’s late. We should sleep. If anything happens, the others will wake 
us.” Murtagh grumbled, but Eragon was too tired to complain. He curled up 
against Saphira, using his shield as a pillow. As his eyes closed, he saw that 
Arya was still awake, watching over them.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4100"><span class="calibre_class_4">His dreams were 
confused and disturbing, full of horned beasts and unseen menaces. Over and 
over he heard a deep voice ask, “Are you ready?” But he never had an answer. 
Plagued by such visions, his sleep was shallow and uneasy until something 
touched his arm. He woke with a start.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4101"><a name="c58" id="c58"><span class="calibre_class_4">B</span></a><span class="calibre_class_4"> </span><span class="calibre_class_25">ATTLE</span><span class="calibre_class_4">U</span><span class="calibre_class_25">NDER</span><span class="calibre_class_4"><br/>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4102"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_157">“I</span><span class="calibre_class_4">t has begun,” 
Arya said with a sorrowful expression. The troops in the encampment stood 
alertly with their weapons drawn. Orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough 
room. Arya nocked an arrow and held it ready to shoot.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4103"><span class="calibre_class_4">“A scout ran out 
of a tunnel a few minutes ago,” said Murtagh to Eragon. “The Urgals are 
coming.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4104"><span class="calibre_class_4">Together they 
watched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened 
stakes. A minute dragged by, then another . . . and another. Without taking his 
eyes from the tunnel, Eragon hoisted himself into Saphira’s saddle, Zar’roc in 
his hand, a comfortable weight. Murtagh mounted Tornac beside him. Then a man 
cried, “I hear them!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4105"><span class="calibre_class_4">The warriors 
stiffened; grips tightened on weapons. No one moved . . . no one breathed. 
Somewhere a horse nickered.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4106"><span class="calibre_class_4">Harsh Urgal 
shouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnel’s opening. 
At a command, the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides, pouring the 
scalding liquid into the tunnel’s hungry throat. The monsters howled in pain, 
arms flailing. A torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch, and an orange pillar 
of greasy flames roared up in the opening, engulfing the Urgals in an inferno. 
Sickened, Eragon looked across Farthen Dûr at the other two battalions and saw 
similar fires by each. He sheathed Zar’roc and strung his bow.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4107"><span class="calibre_class_4">More Urgals soon 
tamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned 
brethren. They clumped together, presenting a solid wall to the men and 
dwarves. Behind the palisade Orik had helped build, the first row of archers 
pulled on their bows and fired. Eragon and Arya added their arrows to the 
deadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the Urgals’ ranks.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4108"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Urgal line 
wavered, threatening to break, but they covered themselves with their shields 
and weathered the attack. Again the archers fired, but the Urgals continued to 
stream onto the surface at a ferocious rate.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4109"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon was 
dismayed by their numbers. They were supposed to kill every single one? It 
seemed a madman’s task. His only encouragement was that he saw none of 
Galbatorix’s troops with the Urgals. Not yet, at least.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4110"><span class="calibre_class_4">The opposing 
army formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly. Tattered 
and sullen standards were raised in the monsters’ midst. Baleful notes echoed 
through Farthen Dûr as war horns sounded. The entire group of Urgals charged 
with savage war cries.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4111"><span class="calibre_class_4">They dashed 
against the rows of stakes, covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as 
the ranks at the vanguard were crushed against the posts. A cloud of black 
arrows flew over the barrier at the crouched defenders. Eragon ducked behind 
his shield, and Saphira covered her head. Arrows rattled harmlessly against her 
armor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4112"><span class="calibre_class_4">Momentarily 
foiled by the pickets, the Urgal horde milled with confusion. The Varden 
bunched together, waiting for the next attack. After a pause, the war cries 
were raised again as the Urgals surged forward. The assault was bitter. Its 
momentum carried the Urgals through the stakes, where a line of pikemen jabbed 
frantically at their ranks, trying to repel them. The pikemen held briefly, but 
the ominous tide of Urgals could not be halted, and they were overwhelmed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4113"><span class="calibre_class_4">The first lines 
of defense breached, the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first 
time. A deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the 
conflict. Saphira bellowed and leapt toward the fight, diving into a whirlwind 
of noise and blurred action.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4114"><span class="calibre_class_4">With her jaws 
and talons, Saphira tore through an Urgal. Her teeth were as lethal as any 
sword, her tail a giant mace. From her back, Eragon parried a hammer blow from 
an Urgal chief, protecting her vulnerable wings. Zar’roc’s crimson blade seemed 
to gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4115"><span class="calibre_class_4">From the corner 
of his eye, Eragon saw Orik hewing Urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax. 
Beside the dwarf was Murtagh on Tornac, his face disfigured by a vicious snarl 
as he swung his sword angrily, cutting through every defense. Then Saphira spun 
around, and Eragon saw Arya leap past the lifeless body of an opponent.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4116"><span class="calibre_class_4">An Urgal bowled 
over a wounded dwarf and hacked at Saphira’s front right leg. His sword skated 
off her armor with a burst of sparks. Eragon smote him on the head, but Zar’roc 
stuck in the monster’s horns and was yanked from his grasp. With a curse he 
dived off Saphira and tackled the Urgal, smashing his face with the shield. He 
jerked Zar’roc out of the horns, then dodged as another Urgal charged him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4117"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira, I need 
you!</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">he 
shouted, but the battle’s tide had separated them. Suddenly a Kull jumped at 
him, club raised for a blow. Unable to lift his shield in time, Eragon uttered, 
“Jierda!” The Kull’s head snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke. 
Four more Urgals succumbed to Zar’roc’s thirsty bite, then Murtagh rode up 
beside Eragon, driving the press of Urgals backward.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4118"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Come on!” he 
shouted, and reached down from Tornac, pulling Eragon onto the horse. They 
rushed toward Saphira, who was embroiled in a mass of enemies. Twelve spear-wielding 
Urgals encircled her, needling her with their lances. They had already managed 
to prick both of her wings. Her blood splattered the ground. Every time she 
rushed at one of the Urgals, they bunched together and jabbed at her eyes, 
forcing her to retreat. She tried to sweep the spears away with her talons, but 
the Urgals jumped back and evaded her.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4119"><span class="calibre_class_4">The sight of 
Saphira’s blood enraged Eragon. He swung off Tornac with a wild cry and stabbed 
the nearest Urgal through the chest, withholding nothing in his frenzied 
attempt to help Saphira. His attack provided the distraction she needed to 
break free. With a kick, she sent an Urgal flying, then barreled to him. Eragon 
grabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle. Murtagh 
raised his hand, then charged into another knot of Urgals.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4120"><span class="calibre_class_4">By unspoken 
consent, Saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies, seeking a 
respite from the madness. Eragon’s breath trembled. His muscles were clenched, 
ready to ward off the next attack. Every fiber of his being thrilled with 
energy, making him feel more alive than ever before.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4121"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira circled 
long enough for them to recover their strength, then descended toward the 
Urgals, skimming the ground to avoid detection. She approached the monsters from 
behind, where their archers were gathered.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4122"><span class="calibre_class_4">Before the 
Urgals realized what was happening, Eragon lopped off the heads of two archers, 
and Saphira disemboweled three others. She took off again as alarms sounded, 
quickly soaring out of bow range.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4123"><span class="calibre_class_4">They repeated 
the tactic on a different flank of the army. Saphira’s stealth and speed, 
combined with the dim lighting, made it nearly impossible for the Urgals to 
predict where she would strike next. Eragon used his bow whenever Saphira was 
in the air, but he quickly ran out of arrows. Soon the only thing left in his 
quiver was magic, which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately 
needed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4124"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira’s 
flights over the combatants gave Eragon a unique understanding of how the 
battle was progressing. There were three separate fights raging in Farthen Dûr, 
one by each open tunnel. The Urgals were disadvantaged by the dispersal of 
their forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the tunnels at 
once. Even so, the Varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from 
advancing and were slowly being driven back toward Tronjheim. The defenders 
seemed insignificant against the mass of Urgals, whose numbers continued to 
increase as they poured out of the tunnels.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4125"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Urgals had 
organized themselves around several standards, each representing a clan, but it 
was unclear who commanded them overall. The clans paid no attention to each 
other, as if they were receiving orders from elsewhere. Eragon wished he knew 
who was in charge so he and Saphira could kill him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4126"><span class="calibre_class_4">Remembering 
Ajihad’s orders, he began relaying information to the Twins. They were 
interested by what he had to say about the Urgals’ apparent lack of a leader 
and questioned him closely. The exchange was smooth, if brief. The Twins told 
him,<i>You’re ordered to assist Hrothgar; the fight goes badly for him.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4127"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Understood,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
responded.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4128"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira swiftly 
flew to the besieged dwarves, swooping low over Hrothgar. Arrayed in golden 
armor, the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin, wielding Volund, 
the hammer of his ancestors. His white beard caught the lantern light as he 
looked up at Saphira. Admiration glinted in his eyes.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4129"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira landed 
beside the dwarves and faced the oncoming Urgals. Even the bravest Kull quailed 
before her ferocity, allowing the dwarves to surge forward. Eragon tried to 
keep Saphira safe. Her left flank was protected by the dwarves, but to her 
front and right raged a sea of enemies. He showed no mercy on those and took 
every advantage he could, using magic whenever Zar’roc could not serve him. A 
spear bounced off his shield, denting it and leaving him with a bruised 
shoulder. Shaking off the pain, he cleaved open an Urgal’s skull, mixing brains 
with metal and bone.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4130"><span class="calibre_class_4">He was in awe of 
Hrothgar—who, though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves, 
was still undiminished on the battlefield. No Urgal, Kull or not, could stand 
before the dwarf king and his guards and live. Every time Volund struck, it 
sounded the gong of death for another enemy. After a spear downed one of his 
warriors, Hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and, with astounding strength, 
hurled it completely through its owner twenty yards away. Such heroism 
emboldened Eragon to ever greater risks, seeking to hold his own with the 
mighty king.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4131"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon lunged at 
a giant Kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from Saphira’s saddle. Before 
he could recover, the Kull darted past Saphira’s defenses and swung his sword. 
The brunt of the blow caught Eragon on the side of his helm, throwing him 
backward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring thunderously.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4132"><span class="calibre_class_4">Stunned, he 
tried to pull himself upright, but the Kull had already prepared for another 
blow. As the Kull’s arm descended, a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from 
his chest. Howling, the monster toppled to the side. In his place stood Angela.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4133"><span class="calibre_class_4">The witch wore a 
long red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green. She bore 
a strange two-handed weapon—a long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to 
each end. Angela winked at Eragon mischievously, then dashed away, spinning her 
staff-sword like a dervish. Close behind her was Solembum in the form of a 
young shaggy-haired boy. He held a small black dagger, sharp teeth bared in a 
feral snarl.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4134"><span class="calibre_class_4">Still dazed from 
his battering, Eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle. Saphira 
jumped into the air and wheeled high above, letting him recuperate. He scanned 
Farthen Dûr’s plains and saw, to his dismay, that all three battles were going 
badly. Neither Ajihad, Jörmundur, nor Hrothgar could stop the Urgals. There 
were simply too many.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4135"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon wondered 
how many Urgals he could kill at once with magic. He knew his limits fairly 
well. If he were to kill enough to make a difference . . . it would probably be 
suicide. That might be what it took to win.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4136"><span class="calibre_class_4">The fighting 
continued for one endless hour after another. The Varden and dwarves were 
exhausted, but the Urgals remained fresh with reinforcements.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4137"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was a 
nightmare for Eragon. Though he and Saphira fought their hardest, there was 
always another Urgal to take the place of the one just killed. His whole body 
hurt—especially his head. Every time he used magic he lost a little more 
energy. Saphira was in better condition, though her wings were punctured with 
small wounds.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4138"><span class="calibre_class_4">As he parried a 
blow, the Twins contacted him urgently.<i>There are loud noises under 
Tronjheim. It sounds like Urgals are trying to dig into the city! We need you 
and Arya to collapse any tunnels they’re excavating.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4139"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
dispatched his opponent with a sword thrust.<i>We’ll be right there.</i> He 
looked for Arya and saw her engaged with a knot of struggling Urgals. Saphira 
quickly forged a path to the elf, leaving a pile of crumpled bodies in her 
wake. Eragon extended his hand and said, “Get on!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4140"><span class="calibre_class_4">Arya jumped onto 
Saphira’s back without hesitation. She wrapped her right arm around Eragon’s 
waist, wielding her bloodstained sword with the other. As Saphira crouched to 
take off, an Urgal ran at her, howling, then lifted an ax and smashed her in 
the chest.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4141"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira roared 
with pain and lurched forward, feet leaving the ground. Her wings snapped open, 
straining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side, right 
wingtip scraping the ground. Below them, the Urgal pulled back his arm to throw 
the ax. But Arya raised her palm, shouting, and an emerald ball of energy shot 
from her hand, killing the Urgal. With a colossal heave of her shoulders, 
Saphira righted herself, barely making it over the heads of the warriors. She 
pulled away from the battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4142"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Are you all 
right?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">asked 
Eragon, concerned. He could not see where she had been struck.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4143"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I’ll live,</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">she said grimly,<i>but 
the front of my armor has been crushed together.It hurts my chest, and I’m 
having trouble moving.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4144"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Can you get us 
to the dragonhold?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4145"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">. . . We’ll see.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4146"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon explained 
Saphira’s condition to Arya. “I’ll stay and help Saphira when we land,” she 
offered. “Once she is free of the armor, I will join you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4147"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Thank you,” he 
said. The flight was laborious for Saphira; she glided whenever she could. When 
they reached the dragonhold, she dropped heavily to Isidar Mithrim, where the 
Twins were supposed to be watching the battle, but it was empty. Eragon jumped 
to the floor and winced as he saw the damage the Urgal had done. Four of the 
metal plates on Saphira’s chest had been hammered together, restricting her 
ability to bend and breathe. “Stay well,” he said, putting a hand on her side, 
then ran out the archway.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4148"><span class="calibre_class_4">He stopped and 
swore. He was at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. Because of his 
worry for Saphira, he had not considered how he would get to Tronjheim’s 
base—where the Urgals were breaking in. There was no time to climb down. He 
looked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs, then grabbed one of the 
leather pads and threw himself down on it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4149"><span class="calibre_class_4">The stone slide 
was smooth as lacquered wood. With the leather underneath him, he accelerated 
almost instantly to a frightening speed, the walls blurring and the curve of 
the slide pressing him high against the wall. Eragon lay completely flat so he 
would go faster. The air rushed past his helm, making it vibrate like a weather 
vane in a gale. The trough was too confined for him, and he was perilously 
close to flying out, but as long as he kept his arms and legs still, he was 
safe.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4150"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was a swift 
descent, but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom. The 
slide leveled out at the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge 
carnelian floor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4151"><span class="calibre_class_4">When he finally 
came to a stop, he was too dizzy to walk. His first attempt to stand made him 
nauseated, so he curled up, head in his hands, and waited for things to stop 
spinning. When he felt better, he stood and warily looked around.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4152"><span class="calibre_class_4">The great 
chamber was completely deserted, the silence unsettling. Rosy light filtered 
down from Isidar Mithrim. He faltered—Where was he supposed to go?—and cast out 
his mind for the Twins. Nothing. He froze as loud knocking echoed through 
Tronjheim.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4153"><span class="calibre_class_4">An explosion 
split the air. A long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet 
up. Needles of rocks flew outward as it crashed down. Eragon stumbled back, 
stunned, groping for Zar’roc. The twisted shapes of Urgals clambered out of the 
hole in the floor.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4154"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
hesitated. Should he flee? Or should he stay and try to close the tunnel? Even 
if he managed to seal it before the Urgals attacked him, what if Tronjheim was 
already breached elsewhere? He could not find all the places in time to prevent 
the city-mountain from being captured.<i>But if I run to one of Tronjheim’s 
gates and blast it open, the Varden could retake Tronjheim without having to 
siege it.</i> Before he could decide, a tall man garbed entirely in black armor 
emerged from the tunnel and looked directly at him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4155"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was Durza.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4156"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade 
carried his pale blade marked with the scratch from Ajihad. A black roundshield 
with a crimson ensign rested on his arm. His dark helmet was richly decorated, 
like a general’s, and a long snakeskin cloak billowed around him. Madness 
burned in his maroon eyes, the madness of one who enjoys power and finds himself 
in the position to use it.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4157"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon knew he 
was neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him. He 
immediately warned Saphira, though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue 
him. He dropped into a crouch and quickly reviewed what Brom had told him about 
fighting another magic user. It was not encouraging. And Ajihad had said that 
Shades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4158"><span class="calibre_class_4">Durza gazed at 
him contemptuously and said, “Kaz jtierl trazhid! Otrag bagh.” The Urgals eyed 
Eragon suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room. Durza 
slowly approached Eragon with a triumphant expression. “So, my young Rider, we 
meet again. You were foolish to escape from me in Gil’ead. It will only make 
things worse for you in the end.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4159"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You’ll never 
capture me alive,” growled Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4160"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Is that so?” 
asked the Shade, raising an eyebrow. The light from the star sapphire gave his 
skin a ghastly tint. “I don’t see your ‘friend’ Murtagh around to help you. You 
can’t stop me now. No one can!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4161"><span class="calibre_class_4">Fear touched 
Eragon.<i>How does he know about Murtagh?</i> Putting all the derision he could 
into his voice, he jeered, “How did you like being shot?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4162"><span class="calibre_class_4">Durza’s face 
tightened momentarily. “I will be repaid in blood for that. Now tell me where 
your dragon is hiding.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4163"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Never.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4164"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade’s 
countenance darkened. “Then I will force it from you!” His sword whistled 
through the air. The moment Eragon caught the blade on his shield, a mental 
probe spiked deep into his thoughts. Fighting to protect his consciousness, he 
shoved Durza back and attacked with his own mind.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4165"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon battered 
with all his strength against the iron-hard defenses surrounding Durza’s mind, 
but to no avail. He swung Zar’roc, trying to catch Durza off guard. The Shade 
knocked the blow aside effortlessly, then stabbed in return with lightning 
speed.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4166"><span class="calibre_class_4">The point of the 
sword caught Eragon in the ribs, piercing his mail and driving out his breath. 
The mail slipped, though, and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire. 
The distraction was all Durza needed to break into Eragon’s mind and begin 
taking control.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4167"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No!” cried 
Eragon, throwing himself at the Shade. His face contorted as he grappled with 
Durza, yanking on his sword arm. Durza tried to cut Eragon’s hand, but it was 
protected by the mail-backed glove, which sent the blade glancing downward. As 
Eragon kicked his leg, Durza snarled and swept his black shield around, 
knocking him to the floor. Eragon tasted blood in his mouth; his neck throbbed. 
Ignoring his injuries, he rolled over and hurled his shield at Durza. Despite 
the Shade’s superior speed, the heavy shield clipped him on the hip. As Durza 
stumbled, Eragon caught him on the upper arm with Zar’roc. A line of blood 
traced down the Shade’s arm.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4168"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon thrust at 
the Shade with his mind and drove through Durza’s weakened defenses. A flood of 
images suddenly engulfed him, rushing through his consciousness—<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4169"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4170"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Durza as a young 
boy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains. The tribe abandoned 
them and called his father “oathbreaker.” Only it was not Durza then, but

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4172"><span class="calibre_class_4">The Shade reeled 
wildly, face twisted in pain. Eragon tried to control the torrent of memories, 
but the force of them was overwhelming.<p/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4187"><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4188"><span class="calibre_class_4">The sword smote 
heavily across Eragon’s back, cutting through both mail and skin. He screamed 
as pain blasted through him, forcing him to his knees. Agony bowed his body in 
half and obliterated all thought. He swayed, barely conscious, hot blood running 
down the small of his back. Durza said something he could not hear.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4189"><span class="calibre_class_4">In anguish, 
Eragon raised his eyes to the heavens, tears streaming down his cheeks. 
Everything had failed. The Varden and dwarves were destroyed. He was defeated. 
Saphira would give herself up for his sake—she had done it before—and Arya 
would be recaptured or killed. Why had it ended like this? What justice could 
this be? All was for nothing.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4190"><span class="calibre_class_4">As he looked at 
Isidar Mithrim far above his tortured frame, a flash of light erupted in his 
eyes, blinding him. A second later, the chamber rang with a deafening report. 
Then his eyes cleared, and he gaped with disbelief.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4191"><span class="calibre_class_4">The star 
sapphire had shattered. An expanding torus of huge dagger-like pieces plummeted 
toward the distant floor—the shimmering shards near the walls. In the center of 
the chamber, hurtling downward headfirst, was Saphira. Her jaws were open and 
from between them erupted a great tongue of flame, bright yellow and tinged 
with blue. On her back was Arya: hair billowing wildly, arm uplifted, palm 
glowing with a nimbus of green magic.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4192"><span class="calibre_class_4">Time seemed to 
slow as Eragon saw Durza tilt his head toward the ceiling. First shock, then 
anger contorted the Shade’s face. Sneering defiantly, he raised his hand and 
pointed at Saphira, a word forming on his lips.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4193"><span class="calibre_class_4">A hidden reserve 
of strength suddenly welled up inside Eragon, dredged from the deepest part of 
his being. His fingers curled around the hilt of his sword. He plunged through 
the barrier in his mind and took hold of the magic. All his pain and rage 
focused on one word:<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4194"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">“Brisingr!”</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4195"><span class="calibre_class_4">Zar’roc blazed 
with bloody light, heatless flames running along it . . .<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4196"><span class="calibre_class_4">He lunged 
forward . . .<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4197"><span class="calibre_class_4">And stabbed 
Durza in the heart.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4198"><span class="calibre_class_4">Durza looked 
down with shock at the blade protruding from his breast. His mouth was open, 
but instead of words, an unearthly howl burst from him. His sword dropped from 
nerveless fingers. He grasped Zar’roc as if to pull it out, but it was lodged 
firmly in him.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4199"><span class="calibre_class_4">Then Durza’s 
skin turned transparent. Under it was neither flesh nor bone, but swirling 
patterns of darkness. He shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated, 
splitting his skin. With one last cry, Durza was rent from head to toe, 
releasing the darkness, which separated into three entities who flew through 
Tronjheim’s walls and out of Farthen Dûr. The Shade was gone.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_4200"><span class="calibre_class_4">Bereft of 
strength, Eragon fell back with arms outstretched. Above him, Saphira and Arya 
had nearly reached the floor—it looked as if they were going to smash into it 
with the deadly remains of Isidar Mithrim. As his sight faded, Saphira, Arya, 
the myriad fragments—all seemed to stop falling and hang motionless in the air.<p/></span></p>
