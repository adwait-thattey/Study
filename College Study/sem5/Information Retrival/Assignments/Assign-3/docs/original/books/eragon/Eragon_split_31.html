<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2344"><span class="calibre_class_18" id="cfs_135">F</span><span class="calibre_class_4">or a long while, 
Eragon was aware only of the burning in his side. Each breath was painful. It 
felt as though he had been the one stabbed, not Brom. His sense of time was 
skewed; it was hard to tell if weeks had gone by, or only a few minutes. When 
consciousness finally came to him, he opened his eyes and peered curiously at a 
campfire several feet away. His hands were still tied together, but the drug 
must have worn off because he could think clearly again.<i>Saphira, are you 
injured?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2345"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">No, but you and 
Brom are.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">She 
was crouched over Eragon, wings spread protectively on either side.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2346"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira, you 
didn’t make that fire, did you? And you couldn’t have gotten out of those 
chains by yourself.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2347"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">No.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> <p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2348"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">I didn’t think 
so.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
struggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2349"><span class="calibre_class_4">The stranger, 
dressed in battered clothes, exuded a calm, assured air. In his hands was a 
bow, at his side a long hand-and-a-half sword. A white horn bound with silver 
fittings lay in his lap, and the hilt of a dagger protruded from his boot. His 
serious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair. He appeared to 
be a few years older than Eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller. Behind him a 
gray war-horse was picketed. The stranger watched Saphira warily.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2350"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Who are you?” 
asked Eragon, taking a shallow breath.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2351"><span class="calibre_class_4">The man’s hands 
tightened on his bow. “Murtagh.” His voice was low and controlled, but 
curiously emotional.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2352"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon pulled 
his hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him. He clenched his 
teeth as his side flared with pain. “Why did you help us?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2353"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You aren’t the 
only enemies the Ra’zac have. I was tracking them.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2354"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You know who 
they are?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2355"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Yes.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2356"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
concentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic. He 
hesitated, aware of Murtagh’s eyes on him, then decided it didn’t matter. 
“Jierda!” he grunted. The ropes snapped off his wrists. He rubbed his hands to 
get the blood flowing.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2357"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh sucked 
in his breath. Eragon braced himself and tried to stand, but his ribs seared 
with agony. He fell back, gasping between clenched teeth. Murtagh tried to come 
to his aid, but Saphira stopped him with a growl. “I would have helped you 
earlier, but your dragon wouldn’t let me near you.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2358"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Her name’s Saphira,” 
said Eragon tightly.<i>Now let him by! I can’t do this alone. Besides, he saved 
our lives.</i> Saphira growled again, but folded her wings and backed away. 
Murtagh eyed her flatly as he stepped forward.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2359"><span class="calibre_class_4">He grasped 
Eragon’s arm, gently pulling him to his feet. Eragon yelped and would have 
fallen without support. They went to the fire, where Brom lay on his back. “How 
is he?” asked Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2360"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Bad,” said 
Murtagh, lowering him to the ground. “The knife went right between his ribs. 
You can look at him in a minute, but first we’d better see how much damage the 
Ra’zac did to you.” He helped Eragon remove his shirt, then whistled. “Ouch!”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2361"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Ouch,” agreed 
Eragon weakly. A blotchy bruise extended down his left side. The red, swollen 
skin was broken in several places. Murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed 
lightly. Eragon yelled, and Saphira growled a warning.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2362"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh glanced 
at Saphira as he grabbed a blanket. “I think you have some broken ribs. It’s 
hard to tell, but at least two, maybe more. You’re lucky you’re not coughing up 
blood.” He tore the blanket into strips and bound Eragon’s chest.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2363"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon slipped 
the shirt back on. “Yes . . . I’m lucky.” He took a shallow breath, sidled over 
to Brom, and saw that Murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound. 
With trembling fingers, he undid the bandage.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2364"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I wouldn’t do 
that,” warned Murtagh. “He’ll bleed to death without it.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2365"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon ignored 
him and pulled the cloth away from Brom’s side. The wound was short and thin, 
belying its depth. Blood streamed out of it. As he had learned when Garrow was 
injured, a wound inflicted by the Ra’zac was slow to heal.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2366"><span class="calibre_class_4">He peeled off 
his gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words Brom had 
taught him.<i>Help me, Saphira,</i> he implored.<i>I am too weak to do this 
alone.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2367"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira crouched 
next to him, fixing her eyes on Brom.<i>I am here, Eragon.</i> As her mind 
joined his, new strength infused his body. Eragon drew upon their combined 
power and focused it on the words. His hand trembled as he held it over the 
wound. “Waíse heill!” he said. His palm glowed, and Brom’s skin flowed 
together, as if it had never been broken. Murtagh watched the entire process.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2368"><span class="calibre_class_4">It was over 
quickly. As the light vanished, Eragon sat, feeling sick.<i>We’ve never done 
that before,</i> he said.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2369"><span class="calibre_class_4">Saphira nodded.<i>Together 
we can cast spells that are beyond either of us.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2370"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh examined 
Brom’s side and asked, “Is he completely healed?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2371"><span class="calibre_class_4">“I can only mend 
what is on the surface. I don’t know enough to fix whatever’s damaged inside. 
It’s up to him now. I’ve done all I can.” Eragon closed his eyes for a moment, 
utterly weary. “My . . . my head seems to be floating in clouds.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2372"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You probably 
need to eat,” said Murtagh. “I’ll make soup.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2373"><span class="calibre_class_4">While Murtagh 
fixed the meal, Eragon wondered who this stranger was. His sword and bow were 
of the finest make, as was his horn. Either he was a thief or accustomed to 
money—and lots of it.<i>Why was he hunting the Ra’zac? What have they done to 
make him an enemy? I wonder if he works for the Varden?</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2374"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh handed 
him a bowl of broth. Eragon spooned it down and asked, “How long has it been 
since the Ra’zac fled?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2375"><span class="calibre_class_4">“A few hours.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2376"><span class="calibre_class_4">“We have to go 
before they return with reinforcements.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2377"><span class="calibre_class_4">“You might be 
able to travel,” said Murtagh, then gestured at Brom, “but he can’t. You don’t 
get up and ride away after being stabbed between the ribs.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2378"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">If we make a 
litter, can you carry Brom with your claws like you did with Garrow?</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon asked 
Saphira.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2379"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">Yes, but landing 
will be awkward.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4"> 
<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2380"><i><span class="calibre_class_4">As long as it 
can be done.</span></i><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon 
said to Murtagh, “Saphira can carry him, but we need a litter. Can you make 
one? I don’t have the strength.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2381"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Wait here.” 
Murtagh left the camp, sword drawn. Eragon hobbled to his bags and picked up 
his bow from where it had been thrown by the Ra’zac. He strung it, found his 
quiver, then retrieved Zar’roc, which lay hidden in shadow. Last, he got a 
blanket for the litter.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2382"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh returned 
with two saplings. He laid them parallel on the ground, then lashed the blanket 
between the poles. After he carefully tied Brom to the makeshift litter, 
Saphira grasped the saplings and laboriously took flight. “I never thought I 
would see a sight like that,” Murtagh said, an odd note in his voice.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2383"><span class="calibre_class_4">As Saphira 
disappeared into the dark sky, Eragon limped to Cadoc and hoisted himself 
painfully into the saddle. “Thanks for helping us. You should leave now. Ride 
as far away from us as you can. You’ll be in danger if the Empire finds you 
with us. We can’t protect you, and I wouldn’t see harm come to you on our 
account.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2384"><span class="calibre_class_4">“A pretty 
speech,” said Murtagh, grinding out the fire, “but where will you go? Is there 
a place nearby that you can rest in safety?”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2385"><span class="calibre_class_4">“No,” admitted 
Eragon.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2386"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh’s eyes 
glinted as he fingered the hilt of his sword. “In that case, I think I’ll 
accompany you until you’re out of danger. I’ve no better place to be. Besides, 
if I stay with you, I might get another shot at the Ra’zac sooner than if I 
were on my own. Interesting things are bound to happen around a Rider.”<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2387"><span class="calibre_class_4">Eragon wavered, 
unsure if he should accept help from a complete stranger. Yet he was 
unpleasantly aware that he was too weak to force the issue either way.<i>If 
Murtagh proves untrustworthy, Saphira can always chase him away.</i> “Join us 
if you wish.” He shrugged.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2388"><span class="calibre_class_4">Murtagh nodded 
and mounted his gray war-horse. Eragon grabbed Snowfire’s reins and rode away 
from the camp, into the wilderness. An oxbow moon provided wan light, but he 
knew that it would only make it easier for the Ra’zac to track them.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2389"><span class="calibre_class_4">Though Eragon 
wanted to question Murtagh further, he kept silent, conserving his energy for riding. 
Near dawn Saphira said,<i>I must stop. My wings are tired and Brom needs 
attention. I discovered a good place to stay, about two miles ahead of where 
you are.</i><p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2390"><span class="calibre_class_4">They found her 
sitting at the base of a broad sandstone formation that curved out of the ground 
like a great hill. Its sides were pocked with caves of varying sizes. Similar 
domes were scattered across the land. Saphira looked pleased with herself.<i>I 
found a cave that can’t be seen from the ground. It’s large enough for all of 
us, including the horses. Follow me.</i> She turned and climbed up the 
sandstone, her sharp claws digging into the rock. The horses had difficulty, as 
their shod hooves could not grip the sandstone. Eragon and Murtagh had to pull 
and shove the animals for almost an hour before they managed to reach the cave.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2391"><span class="calibre_class_4">The cavern was a 
good hundred feet long and more than twenty feet wide, yet it had a small 
opening that would protect them from bad weather and prying eyes. Darkness 
swallowed the far end, clinging to the walls like mats of soft black wool.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2392"><span class="calibre_class_4">“Impressive,” 
said Murtagh. “I’ll gather wood for a fire.” Eragon hurried to Brom. Saphira 
had set him on a small rock ledge at the rear of the cave. Eragon clasped 
Brom’s limp hand and anxiously watched his craggy face. After a few minutes, he 
sighed and went to the fire Murtagh had built.<p/></span></p> 
 
<p class="MsoNormal" id="calibre_css_id_2393"><span class="calibre_class_4">They ate 
quietly, then tried to give Brom water, but the old man would not drink. 
Stymied, they spread out their bedrolls and slept.<p/></span></p>
