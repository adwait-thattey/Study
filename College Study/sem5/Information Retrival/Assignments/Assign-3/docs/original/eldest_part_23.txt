 The day is done; the stars are bright;
 The leaves are still; the moon is white!
 Laugh at woe and laugh at foe,
 Menoa’s scion now is safe this night!
 A forest child we lost to strife;
 A sylvan daughter caught by life!
 Freed of fear and freed of flame,
 She tore a Rider from the shadows rife!
 Again the dragons rise on wing,
 Strong of blade and strong of arm,
 The time is ripe for us to kill a king!
