once a modicum of strength returned to him eragon staggered out of the alley skirting the dead monsters
he did not get far before cadoc trotted to his side
good you were not hurt mumbled eragon
he noticed without particularly caring that his hands were shaking violently and his movements were jerky
he felt detached as if everything he saw were happening to someone else
eragon found snowfire nostrils flared and ears flat against his head prancing by the corner of a house ready to bolt
brom was still slumped motionless in the saddle
eragon reached out with his mind and soothed the horse
once snowfire relaxed eragon went to brom
there was a long blood soaked cut on the old man is right arm
the wound bled profusely but it was neither deep nor wide
still eragon knew it had to be bound before brom lost too much blood
he stroked snowfire for a moment then slid brom out of the saddle
the weight proved too much for him and brom dropped heavily to the ground
eragon was shocked by his own weakness
a scream of rage filled his head
saphira dived out of the sky and landed fiercely in front of him keeping her wings half raised
she hissed angrily eyes burning
her tail lashed and eragon winced as it snapped ** you hurt she asked rage boiling in her voice
no he assured her as he laid brom on his back
she growled and exclaimed where are the ones who did this i will tear them apart
he wearily pointed in the direction of the alley
it will do no good they re already dead
he nodded
** with a few terse words he told her what had happened while he searched his saddlebags for the rags in which zar roc had been wrapped
eragon grunted
he found a long rag and carefully rolled back brom is sleeve
with a few deft strokes he cleaned the cut and bandaged it ** wish we were still in palancar valley he said to ** at least i knew what plants were good for healing
here i do not have any idea what will help him
he retrieved brom is sword from the ground wiped it then returned it to the sheath on brom is belt
we should leave said ** may be more urgals lurking about
can you carry brom your saddle will hold him in place and you can protect him
yes but i am not leaving you alone
fine fly next to me but let is get out of ** tied the saddle onto saphira then put his arms around brom and tried to lift him but again his diminished strength failed ** help
she snaked her head past him and caught the back of brom is robe between her teeth
arching her neck she lifted the old man off the ground like a cat would a kitten and deposited him onto her back
then eragon slipped brom is legs through the saddle is straps and tightened them
he looked up when the old man moaned and shifted
brom blinked blearily putting a hand to his head
he gazed down at eragon with concern
did saphira get here in time
eragon shook his head
i will explain it later
your arm is injured
i bandaged it as best i could but you need a safe place to rest
yes said brom gingerly touching his arm
do you know where my sword
ah i see you found it
eragon finished tightening the straps
saphira is going to take you and follow me by air
are you sure you want me to ride her asked brom
i can ride snowfire
not with that arm
this way even if you faint you wo not fall off
brom nodded
i am ** he wrapped his good arm around saphira is neck and she took off in a flurry springing high into the sky
eragon backed away buffeted by the eddies from her wings and returned to the horses
he tied snowfire behind cadoc then left yazuac returning to the trail and following it southward
it led through a rocky area veered left and continued along the bank of the ninor river
ferns mosses and small bushes dotted the side of the path
it was refreshingly cool under the trees but eragon did not let the soothing air lull him into a sense of security
he stopped briefly to fill the waterskins and let the horses drink
glancing down he saw the ra zac is ** least we re going in the right direction
saphira circled overhead keeping a keen eye on him
it disturbed him that they had seen only two urgals
the villagers had been killed and yazuac ransacked by a large horde yet where was it perhaps the ones we encountered were a rear guard or a trap left for anyone who was following the main force
