i am sorry he said and released an unsteady breath
i can not seem to concentrate
blast it do not apologize growled roran
just do ** leaping down from snowfire he grasped carn on either side of his head holding him in place
look at ** look into the center of my eyes
that is it
keep staring at me
good
now place the ward around us
carn is features cleared and his shoulders loosened and then in a confident voice he recited the incantation
as he uttered the last word he sagged slightly in roran is grip before recovering
it is done he said
roran patted him on the shoulder then clambered into snowfire is saddle again
sweeping his gaze over the ten horsemen he said guard my sides and my back but otherwise keep behind me so long as i am able to swing my hammer
remember the bolts cannot harm you now
carn you stay here
do not move too much conserve your strength
if you feel like you can not maintain the spell any longer signal us before you end it
agreed
carn sat on the front step of the house and nodded
agreed
renewing his grip on his shield and hammer roran took a deep breath attempting to calm himself
brace yourselves he said and clucked his tongue to snowfire
with the ten horsemen following roran rode out into the middle of the dirt street that ran between the houses and faced the soldiers once more
five hundred or so of galbatorix is troops remained in the center of the village most of them crouching or kneeling behind their shields while they struggled to reload their crossbows
occasionally a soldier would stand and loose a bolt at one of the archers on the roofs before dropping back behind his shield as a flight of arrows sliced through the air where he had just been
throughout the corpse strewn clearing patches of arrows studded the ground like reeds sprouting from the bloody soil
several hundred feet away on the far side of the soldiers roran could see a knot of thrashing bodies and he assumed that was where sand edric and whatever remained of their forces were fighting the soldiers
if the young woman and the boy were still in the clearing he did not notice them
a quarrel buzzed toward roran
when the bolt was less than a yard from his chest it abruptly changed direction and hurtled off at an angle missing him and his men
roran flinched but the missile was already past
his throat constricted and his heartbeat doubled
glancing around roran spotted a broken wagon leaning against a house off to his left
he pointed at it and said pull that over here and lay it upside down
block as much of the street as you ** to the archers he shouted do not let the soldiers sneak around and attack us from the ** when they come at us thin out their ranks as much as you can
and as soon as you run out of arrows come join us
just be careful you do not shoot us by accident or i swear i will haunt your halls for the rest of **
more quarrels flew at roran and the other horsemen in the street but in every case the bolts glanced off carn is ward and veered into a wall or the ground or vanished into the sky
roran watched his men drag the wagon into the street
when they were nearly finished he lifted his chin filled his lungs and then projecting his voice toward the soldiers he roared ho there you cowering carrion ** see how only eleven of us bar your way
win past us and you win your freedom
try your hand if you have the guts
what you hesitate where is your manhood you deformed maggots you bilious swine faced murderers your fathers were dribbling half wits who should have been drowned at ** aye and your mothers were poxy trollops and the consorts of ** roran smiled with satisfaction as several of the soldiers howled with outrage and began to insult him in return
one of the soldiers however seemed to lose his will to continue fighting for he sprang to his feet and ran northward covering himself with his shield and darting from side to side in a desperate attempt to avoid the archers
despite his efforts the varden shot him dead before he had gone more than a hundred feet
** exclaimed roran
cowards you are every last one of you you verminous river ** if it will give you spine then know this roran stronghammer is my name and eragon shadeslayer is my ** kill me and that foul king of yours will reward you with an earldom or more
