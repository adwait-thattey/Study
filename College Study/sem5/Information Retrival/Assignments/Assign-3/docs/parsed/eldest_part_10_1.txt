eragon yawned and covered his mouth as people filed into the underground amphitheater
the spacious arena echoed with a babble of voices discussing the funeral that had just concluded
eragon sat on the lowest tier level with the podium
with him were orik arya hrothgar nasuada and the council of elders
saphira stood on the row of stairs that cut upward through the tiers
leaning over orik said ever since korgan each of our kings has been chosen here
it is fitting that the varden should do likewise
it is yet to be seen thought eragon if this transfer of power will remain peaceful
he rubbed an eye brushing away fresh tears the funeral ceremony had left him shaken
lathered over the remnants of his grief anxiety now twisted his gut
he worried about his own role in the upcoming events
even if all went well he and saphira were about to make potent enemies
his hand dropped to zar roc and tightened on the pommel
it took several minutes for the amphitheater to fill
then jormundur stepped up to the podium
people of the varden we last stood here fifteen years ago at deynor is death
his successor ajihad did more to oppose the empire and galbatorix than any before
he won countless battles against superior forces
he nearly killed durza putting a scratch on the shade is blade
and greatest of all he welcomed rider eragon and saphira into tronjheim
however a new leader must be chosen one who will win us even more glory
eragon tried not to react he was pleased to see that jormundur did not even blink
he said perhaps in years to come but he has other duties and responsibilities now
no the council of elders has thought long on this we need one who understands our needs and wants one who has lived and suffered alongside us
one who refused to flee even when battle was imminent
at that moment eragon sensed comprehension rush through the listeners
the name came as a whisper from a thousand throats and was uttered by jormundur himself ** with a bow jormundur stepped aside
next was arya
she surveyed the waiting audience then said the elves honor ajihad tonight
and on behalf of queen islanzadi i recognize nasuada is ascension and offer her the same support and friendship we extended to her father
may the stars watch over her
hrothgar took the podium and stated gruffly i too support nasuada as do the ** he moved aside
then it was eragon is turn
standing before the crowd with all eyes upon him and saphira he said we support nasuada as ** saphira growled in affirmation
pledges spoken the council of elders lined themselves on either side of the podium jormundur at their head
bearing herself proudly nasuada approached and knelt before him her dress splayed in raven billows
raising his voice jormundur said by the right of inheritance and succession we have chosen nasuada
by merit of her father is achievements and the blessings of her peers we have chosen nasuada
i now ask you have we chosen well
jormundur nodded
then by the power granted to this council we pass the privileges and responsibilities accorded to ajihad to his only descendant ** he gently placed a circlet of silver on nasuada is brow
taking her hand he lifted her upright and pronounced i give you our new **
for ten minutes the varden and dwarves cheered thundering their approbation until the hall rang with the clamor
once their cries subsided sabrae motioned to eragon whispering now is the time to fulfill your promise
at that moment all noise seemed to cease for eragon
his nervousness disappeared too swallowed in the tide of the moment
steeling himself with a breath he and saphira started toward jormundur and nasuada each step an eternity
as they walked he stared at sabrae elessari umerth and falberd noting their half smiles smugness and on sabrae is part outright disdain
behind the council members stood arya
she nodded in support
we are about to change history said saphira
we re throwing ourselves off a cliff without knowing how deep the water below is
ah but what a glorious flight
with a brief look at nasuada is serene face eragon bowed and kneeled
slipping zar roc from its sheath he placed the sword flat on his palms then lifted it as if to proffer it to jormundur
