a black beard carelessly trimmed roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles
sloan what have you done now
** he gave eragon a murderous gaze then spat this
boy came in here and started badgering me
i asked him to leave but he wo not budge
i even threatened him and he still ignored ** sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at horst
is this true demanded the smith
** replied eragon
i offered this stone as payment for some meat and he accepted it
when i told him that i d found it in the spine he refused to even touch it
what difference does it make where it came from
horst looked at the stone curiously then returned his attention to the butcher
why wo not you trade with him sloan i ve no love for the spine myself but if it is a question of the stone is worth i will back it with my own money
the question hung in the air for a moment
then sloan licked his lips and said this is my own store
i can do whatever i want
katrina stepped out from behind horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten copper
father eragonis willing to pay
give him the meat and then we can have supper
sloan is eyes narrowed dangerously
go back to the house this is none of your business
i saidgo ** katrina is face hardened then she marched out of the room with a stiff back
eragon watched with disapproval but dared not interfere
horst tugged at his beard before saying reproachfully fine you can deal with me
what were you going to get eragon his voice reverberated through the room
horst pulled out a purse and counted out a pile of coins
give me your best roasts and steaks
make sure that it is enough to fill eragon is ** the butcher hesitated his gaze darting between horst and eragon
not selling to me would be a very bad idea stated horst
glowering venomously sloan slipped into the back room
a frenzy of chopping wrapping and low cursing reached them
after several uncomfortable minutes he returned with an armful of wrapped meat
his face was expressionless as he accepted horst is money then proceeded to clean his knife pretending that they were not there
horst scooped up the meat and walked outside
eragon hurried behind him carrying his pack and the stone
the crisp night air rolled over their faces refreshing after the stuffy shop
thank you horst
uncle garrow will be pleased
horst laughed quietly
do not thank me
i ve wanted to do that for a long time
sloan is a vicious troublemaker it does him good to be humbled
katrina heard what was happening and ran to fetch me
good thing i came the two of you were almost at blows
unfortunately i doubt he will serve you or any of your family the next time you go in there even if you do have coins
why did he explode like that we ve never been friendly but he is always taken our money
and i ve never seen him treat katrina that way said eragon opening the top of the pack
horst shrugged
ask your uncle
he knows more about it than i do
eragon stuffed the meat into his pack
well now i have one more reason to hurry home
to solve this mystery
here this is rightfully ** he proffered the stone
horst chuckled
no you keep your strange rock
as for payment albriech plans to leave for feinster next spring
he wants to become a master smith and i am going to need an assistant
you can come and work off the debt on your spare days
eragon bowed slightly delighted
horst had two sons albriech and baldor both of whom worked in his forge
taking one is place was a generous offer
again thank ** i look forward to working with ** he was glad that there was a way for him to pay horst
his uncle would never accept charity
then eragon remembered what his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt
roran wanted me to give katrina a message but since i can not can you get it to her
he wants her to know that he will come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will see her then
eragon was slightly embarrassed
no he also wants her to know that she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else
horst is face broke into a broad grin and he winked at eragon
getting serious is not he
