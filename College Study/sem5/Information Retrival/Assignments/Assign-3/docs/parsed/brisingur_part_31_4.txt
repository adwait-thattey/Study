i see no forest of stone
clambering down from his pony orik handed the reins to the warrior behind him and said walk with me if you would eragon
together they strode toward the twisting bank of fog eragon shortening his steps to match orik is
the mist kissed eragon is face cool and moist
the vapor became so thick that it obscured the rest of the valley enveloping them in a featureless gray landscape where even up and down seemed arbitrary
undaunted orik proceeded with a confident gait
eragon however felt disoriented and slightly unsteady and he walked with a hand held out in front of him in case he should bump into anything hidden within the fog
orik stopped at the edge of a thin crack that defaced the granite they stood on and said what see you now
squinting eragon swept his gaze back and forth but the fog seemed as monotonous as ever
he opened his mouth to say as much but then noticed a slight irregularity in the texture of the mist to his right a faint pattern of light and dark that held its shape even while the mist drifted past
he became aware of other areas that were static as well strange abstract patches of contrast that formed no recognizable objects
i do not
he started to say when a breath of wind ruffled his hair
under the gentle encouragement of the newborn breeze the fog thinned and the disjoined patterns of shade resolved into the boles of large ash colored trees with bare and broken limbs
dozens of the trees surrounded him and orik the pale skeletons of an ancient forest
eragon pressed his palm against a trunk
the bark was as cold and hard as a boulder
blotches of pallid lichen clung to the surface of the tree
the back of eragon is neck prickled
although he did not consider himself overly superstitious the ghostly mist and the eerie half light and the appearance of the trees themselves grim and foreboding and mysterious ignited a spark of fear inside of him
he wet his lips and asked how did these come to be
orik shrugged
some claim that guntera must have placed them here when he created alagaesia out of nothingness
others claim helzvog made them for stone is his favorite element and would not the god of stone have trees of stone for his garden and still others say no that once these were trees like any others and a great catastrophe eons ago must have buried them in the ground and that over time wood became dirt and dirt became stone
only the gods know for certain
who besides them can hope to understand the whys and wherefores of the world orik shifted his position
our ancestors discovered the first of the trees while quarrying granite here over a thousand years ago
the then grimstborith of durgrimst ingeitum hvalmar lackhand stopped the mining and instead had his masons chisel out the trees from the surrounding stone
when they had excavated nigh on fifty trees hvalmar realized that there might be hundreds or even thousands of stone trees entombed within the side of mount thardur and so he ordered his men to abandon the project
this place however captured the imagination of our race and ever since knurlan from every clan have traveled here and labored to extricate more trees from the grip of the granite
there are even knurlan who have dedicated their lives to the task
it has also become a tradition to send troublesome offspring here to chisel out a tree or two while under the supervision of a master mason
it gives them time to repent of their ** with one hand orik stroked his braided beard
i spent some months here myself when i was a rambunctious lad of four and thirty
and did you repent of your ways
eta
no
it was too
tedious
after all those weeks i had freed only a single branch from the granite so i ran away and fell in with a group of vrenshrrgn
yes knurlagn of the clan vrenshrrgn war wolves wolves of war however you might say it in this tongue
i fell in with them became drunk on ale and as they were hunting nagran decided that i too should kill a boar and bring it to hrothgar to appease his anger at me
it was not the wisest thing i have done
even our most skilled warriors fear to hunt nagran and i was still more boy than man
