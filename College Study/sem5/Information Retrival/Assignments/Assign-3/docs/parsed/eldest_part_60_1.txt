underneath saphira the pathless forest stretched wide to each white horizon fading as it did from the deepest green to a hazy washed out purple
martins rooks and other woodland birds flitted above the gnarled pines uttering shrieks of alarm when they beheld saphira
she flew low to the canopy in order to protect her two passengers from the arctic temperatures in the upper reaches of the sky
except for when saphira fled the ra zac into the spine this was the first time she and eragon had had the opportunity to fly together over a great stretch of distance without having to stop or hold back for companions on the ground
saphira was especially pleased with the trip and she delighted in showing eragon how glaedr is tutelage had enhanced her strength and endurance
after his initial discomfort abated orik said to eragon i doubt i could ever be comfortable in the air but i can understand why you and saphira enjoy it so
flying makes you feel free and unfettered like a fierce eyed hawk hunting his ** it sets my heart a pounding it does
to reduce the tedium of the journey orik played a game of riddles with saphira
eragon excused himself from the contest as he had never been particularly adept at riddles the twist of thought necessary to solve them always seemed to escape him
in this saphira far exceeded him
as most dragons are she was fascinated by puzzles and found them quite easy to unravel
orik said the only riddles i know are in dwarvish
i will do mine best to translate them but the results may be rough and ** then he asked
while with life i do glow
not fair growled ** know little of your gods
eragon had no need to repeat her words for orik had granted permission for her to project them directly into his mind
orik laughed
do you give up
** a few minutes the only sound was the sweep of her wings until she asked is it a candle
a puff of hot smoke floated back into orik is and eragon is faces as she ** do poorly with such riddles
i ve not been inside a house since the day i hatched and i find enigmas difficult that deal with domestic subjects
next she offered
this proved a terrible poser for orik
he grumbled and groaned and gnashed his teeth in frustration
behind him eragon could not help but grin for he saw the answer plain in saphira is mind
finally orik said well what is it you have bested me with this
by the black raven is crime and by this rhyme
now it was orik is turn to cry not ** this is not mine native tongue
you cannot expect me to grasp such **
fair is fair
it was a proper riddle
eragon watched the muscles at the back of orik is neck bunch and knot as the dwarf jutted his head forward
ifthat is your stance o irontooth then i d have you solve this riddle that every dwarf child knows
i am named morgothal is forge and helzvog is womb
i veil nordvig is daughter and bring gray death
and make the world anew with helzvog is blood
and so they went exchanging riddles of increasing difficulty while du weldenvarden sped past below
gaps in the thatched branches often revealed patches of silver sections of the many rivers that threaded the forest
around saphira the clouds billowed in a fantastic architecture vaulting arches domes and columns crenelated ramparts towers the size of mountains and ridges and valleys suffused with a glowing light that made eragon feel as if they flew through a dream
so fast was saphira that when dusk arrived they had already left du weldenvarden behind and entered the auburn fields that separated the great forest from the hadarac desert
they made their camp among the grass and hunkered round their small fire utterly alone upon the flat face of the earth
they were grim faced and said little for words only emphasized their insignificance in that bare and empty land
eragon took advantage of their stop to store some of his energy in the ruby that adorned zar roc is pommel
the gem absorbed all the power he gave it as well as saphira is when she lent her strength
it would concluded eragon be a number of days before they could saturate both the ruby and the twelve diamonds concealed within the belt of beloth the wise
