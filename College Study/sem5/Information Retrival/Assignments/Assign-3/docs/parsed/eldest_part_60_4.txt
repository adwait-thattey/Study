ah ** now eragon remembered
he had read about them in one of the histories oromis assigned him
the plains which contained huge deposits of peat lay along the eastern side of the jiet river where surda is border crossed it and had been the site of a skirmish between the riders and the forsworn
during the fight the dragons inadvertently lit the peat with the flames from their mouths and the fire had burrowed underground where it remained smoldering ever since
the land had been rendered uninhabitable by the noxious fumes that poured out of the glowing vents in the charred earth
a shiver crawled down eragon is left side as he recalled his premonition banks of warriors colliding upon an orange and yellow field accompanied by the harsh screams of gore crows and the whistle of black arrows
he shivered ** is converging upon us he said to saphira
then gesturing at the map have you seen enough
in short order he and orik packed the supplies remounted saphira and from her back thanked dahwar for his service
as saphira was about to take off again eragon frowned a note of discord had entered the minds he was monitoring
dahwar two grooms in the stables have gotten into an argument and one of them tathal intends to commit murder
you can stop him though if you send men right away
dahwar widened his eyes in an expression of astonishment and even orik twisted round to look at eragon
the seneschal asked how do you know this shadeslayer
eragon merely said because i am a rider
then saphira unfurled her wings and everyone on the ground ran back to avoid being battered by the rush of air as she flapped downward and soared into the sky
as borromeo castle dwindled behind them orik said can you hear my thoughts eragon
do you want me to try i have not you know
frowning eragon concentrated his attention on the dwarf is consciousness and was surprised to find orik is mind well protected behind thick mental barriers
he could sense orik is presence but not his thoughts and feelings
nothing
orik grinned
good
i wanted to make sure i had not forgotten my old lessons
by unspoken consent they did not stop for the night but rather forged onward through the blackened sky
of the moon and stars they saw no sign no flash or pale gleam to breach the oppressive gloom
the dead hours bloated and sagged and it seemed to eragon clung to each second as if reluctant to surrender to the past
when the sun finally returned bringing with it its welcome light saphira landed by the edge of a small lake so eragon and orik could stretch their legs relieve themselves and eat breakfast without the constant movement they experienced on her back
they had just taken off again when a long low brown cloud appeared on the edge of the horizon like a smudge of walnut ink on a sheet of white paper
the cloud grew wider and wider as saphira approached it until by late morning it obscured the entire land beneath a pall of foul vapors
they had reached the burning plains of alagaesia
