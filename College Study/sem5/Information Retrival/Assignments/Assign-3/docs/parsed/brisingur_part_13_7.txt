without warning the twelve elves filled the air with their clear bright laughter and birds for over a mile in every direction burst into song
the sound of their mirth was like water falling on crystal
nasuada smiled without meaning to and around her she saw similar expressions on the faces of her guards
even the two urgals seemed giddy with joy
and when the elves fell silent and the world became mundane again nasuada felt the sadness of a fading dream
a film of tears obscured her vision for a clutch of heartbeats and then that too was gone
smiling for the first time and thereby presenting a visage both handsome and terrifying blodhgarm said it will be an honor to serve alongside a woman as intelligent capable and witty as yourself lady nasuada
one of these days when your duties permit i would be delighted to teach you our game of runes
you would make a formidable opponent i am sure
the elves sudden shift in behavior reminded her of a word she had occasionally heard the dwarves use to describe them capricious
it had seemed a harmless enough description when she was a girl it reinforced her concept of the elves as creatures who flitted from one delight to another like fairies in a garden of flowers but she now recognized that what the dwarves really meant was ** beware for you never know what an elf will do
she sighed to herself depressed by the prospect of having to contend with another group of beings intent on controlling her for their own ends
is life always this complicated she wondered
or do i bring it upon myself
from within the camp she saw king orrin riding toward them at the head of a massive train of nobles courtiers functionaries major and minor advisers assistants servants men at arms and a plethora of other species she did not bother identifying while from the west rapidly descending on outstretched wings she saw saphira
girding herself for the loud tedium about to engulf them she said it may be some months before i have the opportunity to accept your offer blodhgarm but i appreciate it nevertheless
i would enjoy the distraction of a game after the work of a long day
for the present however it must remain a deferred pleasure
the entire weight of human society is about to crash down upon you
i suggest you prepare yourselves for an avalanche of names questions and requests
we humans are a curious lot and none of us have seen so many elves before
we are prepared for this lady nasuada said blodhgarm
as king orrin is thundering cavalcade drew near and saphira prepared to land flattening the grass with the wind from her wings nasuada is last thought was oh dear
i will have to put a battalion around blodhgarm to keep him from being torn apart by the women in the camp
and even that might not solve the problem
