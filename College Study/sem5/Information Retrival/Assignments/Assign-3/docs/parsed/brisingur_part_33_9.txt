he flipped upright and berating himself for not trying this sooner shouted a spell laced with nine of the twelve death words oromis had taught him
however the moment after he loosed his magic he abandoned the spell for the black garbed dwarves were protected by numerous wards
given a few minutes he might have been able to evade or defeat the wards but minutes might as well have been days in a battle such as theirs where every second was as long as an hour
having failed with magic eragon hardened his thoughts into an iron hard spear and launched it at where the consciousness of one of the black garbed dwarves ought to be
the spear skated off mental armor of a sort eragon had not encountered before smooth and seamless seemingly unbroken by the concerns natural to mortal creatures engaged in a struggle to the death
someone else is protecting them eragon realized
there are more behind this attack than just these seven
pivoting on one foot eragon lunged forward and with his falchion impaled his leftmost attacker in a knee drawing blood
the dwarf stumbled and eragon is guards converged upon him grasping the dwarf is arms so he could not swing his dire blade and hacking at him with their curved axes
the nearest of the last two attackers raised his shield in anticipation of the blow eragon was about to direct at him
summoning the full measure of his might eragon cut at the shield intending to shear it and the arm underneath in half as he had often done with zar roc
in the fever of battle though he forgot to account for the dwarf is inexplicable speed
as the falchion neared its target the dwarf tilted his shield so as to deflect the blow to the side
two plumes of sparks erupted from the surface of the shield as the falchion glanced off the upper part and then the steel spike mounted in the center
momentum carried the falchion farther than eragon had intended and it continued flying through the air until it struck edge first against a wall jarring eragon is arm
with a crystalline sound the blade of the falchion shattered into a dozen pieces leaving him with a six inch spike of jagged metal protruding from the hilt
dismayed eragon dropped the broken sword and gripped the rim of the dwarf is buckler wresting with him back and forth and struggling to keep the shield between him and the dagger graced with a halo of translucent colors
the dwarf was incredibly tough he matched eragon is efforts and even succeeded in pushing him back a step
releasing the buckler with his right hand but still holding on with his left eragon drew back his arm and struck the shield as hard as he could punching through the tempered steel as easily as if it were made of rotten wood
because of the calluses on his knuckles he felt no pain from the impact
the force of the blow threw the dwarf against the opposite wall
his head lolling upon a boneless neck the dwarf dropped to the ground like a puppet whose strings had been severed
eragon pulled his hand back through the jagged hole in the shield scratching himself on the torn metal and drew his hunting knife
then the last of the black garbed dwarves was upon him
eragon parried his dagger twice
thrice
and then cut through the dwarf is padded sleeve and scored his dagger arm from the elbow to the wrist
the dwarf hissed with pain blue eyes furious above his cloth mask
he initiated a series of blows the dagger whistling through the air faster than the eye could follow which forced eragon to hop away to avoid the deadly edge
the dwarf pressed the attack
for several yards eragon succeeded in evading him until his heel struck a body and in attempting to step around it he stumbled and fell against a wall bruising his shoulder
with an evil laugh the dwarf pounced stabbing downward toward eragon is exposed chest
throwing up an arm in a futile attempt to protect himself eragon rolled farther down the hallway knowing that this time his luck had run out and he would not be able to escape
as he completed a revolution and his face was momentarily turned toward the dwarf again eragon glimpsed the pale dagger descending toward his flesh like a bolt of lightning from on high
