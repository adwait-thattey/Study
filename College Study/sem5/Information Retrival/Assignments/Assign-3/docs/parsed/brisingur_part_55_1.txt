roran stood with his arms outstretched while katrina laced up the sides of the padded jerkin she had fitted for him
when she finished she tugged on the hem of the jerkin smoothing out the wrinkles and said there now
is it too tight
she retrieved his greaves from the cot they shared and knelt before him in the flickering candlelight
roran watched as she buckled the greaves onto his lower legs
she cupped the curve of his calf with her hand as she secured the second piece of armor her flesh warm against his through the fabric of his trousers
standing she turned to the cot again and picked up his bracers
roran held out his arms toward her and stared into her eyes even as she stared into his
with slow deliberate motions she fastened the bracers onto his forearms then drew her hands from the inside of his elbow down to his wrists where he clasped her hands with his own
she smiled and pulled free of his gentle grip
next from the cot she took his shirt of mail
she rose up onto the tips of her toes and lifted the hauberk over his head and held it there while he fit his arms into the sleeves
the mail tinkled like ice as she released it and it fell onto his shoulders unfurling so that the lower edge hung level with his knees
on his head she set his leather arming cap tying it firmly in place with a knot under his chin
she held his face between her hands for a moment then kissed him once upon the lips and fetched his peaked helm which she carefully slid over the arming cap
roran slipped his arm around her thickening waist as she started back toward the cot stopping her
listen to me he said
i will be ** he tried to convey all his love for her through the tone of his voice and the strength of his gaze
do not just sit here all alone
promise me that
go to elain she could use your help
she is sick and her child is overdue
katrina lifted her chin her eyes gleaming with tears he knew she would not shed until after he had left
must you march in the front line she whispered
someone must and it might as well be me
whom would you send in my stead
anyone
anyone at ** katrina looked down and was silent for a span then she removed a red kerchief from the bodice of her dress and said here carry this favor of mine so that the whole world may know how proud i am of ** and she tied the kerchief to his sword belt
roran kissed her twice and released her and she fetched his shield and spear from the cot
he kissed her a third time as he took them from her then fit his arm through the strap on his shield
if something does happen to me he began to say
katrina placed a finger upon his lips
shh
speak not of it lest it should come true
very ** he hugged her one last time
be safe
although he hated to leave her roran raised his shield and strode out of the tent into the pale light of dawn
men dwarves and urgals streamed westward through the camp heading toward the trampled field where the varden were assembling
roran filled his lungs with the cool morning air and then followed knowing that his band of warriors would be waiting for him
once he arrived at the field he sought out jormundur is division and after reporting to jormundur made his way to the front of the group where he chose to stand next to yarbog
the urgal glanced at him then grunted a good day for a battle
a horn sounded at the forefront of the varden as soon as the sun broke over the horizon
roran hefted his spear and began to run forward like everyone else around him howling at the top of his lungs as arrows rained down upon them and boulders whistled past overhead flying in either direction
ahead of him a stone wall eighty feet tall loomed
the siege of feinster had begun
