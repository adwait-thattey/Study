** ** exclaimed a female elf with long black hair
are you hurt we heard saphira is lament and we thought one of you might have died
eragon glanced at arya
his oath of secrecy to queen islanzadi would not allow him to discuss oromis or glaedr while in the presence of anyone not from du weldenvarden such as lady lorana without permission from the queen arya or whoever might succeed islanzadi to the knotted throne in ellesmera
she nodded and said i release you from your vow eragon both of you
speak of them to whomever you choose
no we are not hurt eragon said
however oromis and glaedr have just died slain in battle over gil ead
as one the elves cried out in shock and then began to ply eragon with dozens of questions
arya raised a hand and said restrain yourselves
now is not the time or place to satisfy your curiosity
there are still soldiers about and we do not know who might be listening
keep your sorrow hidden within your hearts until we are safe and ** she paused and looked at eragon then said i will explain the full circumstances of their deaths to you once i know them myself
nen ono weohnata arya drottningu they murmured
did you hear my call eragon asked blodhgarm
i did the fur covered elf said
we came as fast as we could but there were many soldiers between there and here
eragon twisted his hand over his chest in the elves traditional gesture of respect
i apologize for leaving you behind blodhgarmelda
the heat of battle made me foolish and overconfident and we nearly died because of my mistake
you need not apologize shadeslayer
we too made a mistake today one which i promise we shall not repeat
from now on we will fight alongside you and the varden without reserve
together they all trooped down the stairs to the courtyard outside
the varden had killed or captured most of the soldiers within the keep and the few men who were still fighting surrendered once they saw that lady lorana was in the custody of the varden
since the stairwell was too small for her saphira had descended by wing to the courtyard and was waiting for them when they arrived
eragon stood with saphira arya and lady lorana while one of the varden fetched jormundur
when jormundur joined them they informed him of what had happened within the tower which amazed him greatly and then gave over lady lorana to his custody
jormundur bowed to her
you may rest assured lady we shall treat you with the respect and dignity due your station
we may be your enemies but we are still civilized men
thank you she replied
i am relieved to hear it
however my main concern now is for the safety of my subjects
if i might i would like to speak with your leader nasuada about her plans for them
i believe she wishes to speak with you as well
as they parted lady lorana said i am most grateful to you elf and to you as well dragon rider for killing that monster before he could wreak sorrow and destruction upon feinster
fate has placed us on opposite sides of this conflict but that does not mean i cannot admire your bravery and prowess
we may never meet again so fare thee well both of you
eragon bowed and said fare thee well lady lorana
may the stars watch over you said arya
blodhgarm and the elves under his command accompanied eragon saphira and arya as they searched feinster for nasuada
they found her riding her stallion through the gray streets inspecting the damage to the city
nasuada greeted eragon and saphira with evident relief
i am glad you have finally returned
we ve needed you here these past few days
i see you have a new sword eragon a dragon rider is sword
did the elves give it to you
in an indirect way ** eragon eyed the various people standing nearby and lowered his voice
nasuada we must talk with you alone
it is important
very ** nasuada studied the buildings that lined the street then pointed at a house that appeared abandoned
let us talk in there
two of nasuada is guards the nighthawks ran forward and entered the house
they reappeared a few minutes later and bowed to nasuada saying it is empty my lady
good
thank ** she dismounted her steed handed the reins to one of the men in her retinue and strode inside
