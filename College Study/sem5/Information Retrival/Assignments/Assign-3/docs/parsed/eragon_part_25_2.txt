it would be unfortunate if anyone knew i was here
jeod looked around wildly shock plain on his face
i thought you were dead he whispered
what happened why have not you contacted me before
all things will be explained
do you have a place where we can talk safely
jeod hesitated swinging his gaze between eragon and brom face unreadable
finally he said we can not talk here but if you wait a moment i will take you somewhere we can
fine said brom
jeod nodded and vanished behind the door
i hope i can learn something of brom is past thought eragon
there was a rapier at jeod is side when he reappeared
an embroidered jacket hung loosely on his shoulders matched by a plumed hat
brom cast a critical eye at the finery and jeod shrugged self consciously
he took them through teirm toward the citadel
eragon led the horses behind the two men
jeod gestured at their destination
risthart the lord of teirm has decreed that all the business owners must have their headquarters in his castle
even though most of us conduct our business elsewhere we still have to rent rooms there
it is nonsense but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm
we will be free of eavesdroppers in there the walls are thick
they went through the fortress is main gate and into the keep
jeod strode to a side door and pointed to an iron ring
you can tie the horses there
no one will bother ** when snowfire and cadoc were safely tethered he opened the door with an iron key and let them inside
within was a long empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls
eragon was surprised by how cold and damp it was
when he touched the wall his fingers slid over a layer of slime
he shivered
jeod snatched a torch from its bracket and led them down the hall
they stopped before a heavy wooden door
he unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a bearskin rug laden with stuffed chairs
bookshelves stacked with leather bound tomes covered the walls
jeod piled wood in the fireplace then thrust the torch under it
the fire quickly roared
you old man have some explaining to do
brom is face crinkled with a smile
who are you calling an old man the last time i saw you there was no gray in your hair
now it looks like it is in the final stages of decomposition
and you look the same as you did nearly twenty years ago
time seems to have preserved you as a crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation
enough of ** get on with the story
that is always what you were good at said jeod impatiently
eragon is ears pricked up and he waited eagerly to hear what brom would say
brom relaxed into a chair and pulled out his pipe
he slowly blew a smoke ring that turned green darted into the fireplace then flew up the chimney
do you remember what we were doing in gil ead
yes of course said jeod
that sort of thing is hard to forget
an understatement but true nevertheless said brom dryly
when we were
separated i could not find you
in the midst of the turmoil i stumbled into a small room
there was not anything extraordinary in it just crates and boxes but out of curiosity i rummaged around anyway
fortune smiled on me that hour for i found what we had been searching ** an expression of shock ran over jeod is face
once it was in my hands i could not wait for you
at any second i might have been discovered and all lost
disguising myself as best i could i fled the city and ran to the
brom hesitated and glanced at eragon then said ran to our friends
they stored it in a vault for safekeeping and made me promise to care for whomever received it
until the day when my skills would be needed i had to disappear
no one could know that i was alive not even you though it grieved me to pain you unnecessarily
so i went north and hid in carvahall
eragon clenched his jaw infuriated that brom was deliberately keeping him in the dark
jeod frowned and asked then our
friends knew that you were alive all along
he sighed
i suppose the ruse was unavoidable though i wish they had told me
is not carvahall farther north on the other side of the spine brom inclined his head
for the first time jeod inspected eragon
