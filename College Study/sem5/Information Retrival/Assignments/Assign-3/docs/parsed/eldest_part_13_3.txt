roran grabbed his blankets and saddled the frightened mare then spurred her farther up the mountain hoping to find clear air
it quickly became apparent that the smoke was ascending with him so he turned and cut sideways through the forest
after several minutes spent maneuvering in the dark they finally broke free and rode onto a ledge swept clean by a breeze
purging his lungs with long breaths roran scanned the valley for the fire
he spotted it in an instant
carvahall is hay barn glowed white in a cyclone of flames transforming its precious contents into a fountain of amber motes
roran trembled as he watched the destruction of the town is feed
he wanted to scream and run through the forest to help with the bucket brigade yet he could not force himself to abandon his own safety
now a molten spark landed on delwin is house
within seconds the thatched roof exploded in a wave of fire
roran cursed and tore his hair tears streaming down his face
this was why mishandling fire was a hanging offense in ** it an accident was it the soldiers are the ra zac punishing the villagers for shielding me
am i somehow responsible for this
fisk is house joined the conflagration next
aghast roran could only avert his face hating himself for his cowardice
by dawn all the fires had been extinguished or burned out on their own
only sheer luck and a calm night saved the rest of carvahall from being consumed
roran waited until he was sure of the outcome then retreated to his old camp and threw himself down to rest
from morning through evening he was oblivious to the world except through the lens of his troubled dreams
upon his return to awareness roran simply waited for the visitor he was sure would appear
this time it was albriech
he arrived at dusk with a grim worn expression
come with me he said
roran tensed
why have they decided to give me up if hewas the cause of the fire he could understand the villagers wanting him gone
he might even agree it was necessary
it was unreasonable to expect everyone in carvahall to sacrifice themselves for him
still that did not mean he would allow them to just hand him over to the ra zac
after what the two monsters had done to quimby roran would fight to the death to avoid being their prisoner
because said albriech clenching his jaw muscles it was the soldiers who started the fire
morn banned them from the seven sheaves but they still got drunk on their own beer
one of them dropped a torch against the hay barn on his way to bed
a few burns
gertrude was able to handle them
we tried to negotiate with the ra zac
they spat on our requests that the empire replace our losses and the guilty face justice
they even refused to confine the soldiers to the tents
albriech chuckled hollowly
for hammer and tongs
we need your help to
remove the ra zac
you would do that for me
we re not risking ourselves for your sake alone
this concerns the entire village now
at least come talk to father and the others and hear their thoughts
i d think you would be glad to get out of these cursed mountains
roran considered albriech is proposition long and hard before deciding to accompany ** is this or run for it and i can always run later
he fetched the mare tied his bags to the saddle then followed albriech toward the valley floor
their progress slowed as they neared carvahall using trees and brush for cover
slipping behind a rain barrel albriech checked to see if the streets were clear then signaled to roran
together they crept from shadow to shade constantly on guard for the empire is servants
at horst is forge albriech opened one of the double doors just far enough for roran and the mare to quietly enter
inside the workshop was lit by a single candle which cast a trembling glow over the ring of faces that hovered about it in the surrounding darkness
horst was there his thick beard protruded like a shelf into the light flanked by the hard visages of delwin gedric and then loring
the rest of the group was composed of younger men baldor loring is three sons parr and quimby is boy nolfavrell who was only thirteen
