he stared at his hands without seeing ** wonder if murtagh is scar ever pained him like mine does
a dead silence followed
then i am afraid
because
he ** nothing i do will prevent another attack
i do not know when or where it will happen but i do know that it is inevitable
so i wait and every moment i fear that if i lift something too heavy or stretch in the wrong way the pain will return
my own body has become the enemy
saphira hummed deep in her ** have no answers either
life is both pain and pleasure
if this is the price you must pay for the hours you enjoy is it too much
yes he snapped
he pulled off the blankets and shoved past her stumbling into the center of the camp where arya and the dwarves sat around a fire
is there food left asked eragon
duthmer wordlessly filled a bowl and handed it to him
with a deferential expression thorv asked are you better now shadeslayer he and the other dwarves seemed awed by what they had seen
you bear a heavy burden shadeslayer
eragon scowled and abruptly walked to the edge of the tents where he seated himself in darkness
he could sense saphira nearby but she left him in peace
he swore under his breath and jabbed duthmer is stew with dull anger
just as he took a bite orik said from beside him you should not treat them so
eragon glared at orik is shadowed face
what
thorv and his men were sent to protect you and saphira
they will die for you if need be and trust their sacred burial to you
you should remember that
eragon bit back a sharp retort and gazed at the black surface of the river always moving never stopping in an attempt to calm his mind
you re right
i let my temper get away from me
orik is teeth gleamed in the night as he smiled
it is a lesson that every commander must learn
i had it beaten into me by hrothgar after i threw my boot at a dwarf who left his halberd where someone could step on it
i broke his nose chuckled orik
despite himself eragon laughed as well
i will remember not to do ** he held the bowl with both hands to keep them warm
eragon heard the jangle of metal as orik extracted something from a pouch
here said the dwarf dropping a knot of intertwined gold rings on eragon is palm
it is a puzzle we use to test cleverness and dexterity
there are eight bands
if you arrange them properly they form a single ring
i ve found it useful for distracting myself when i am troubled
thank you murmured eragon already entranced by the complexity of the gleaming nest
you can keep it if you can put it together
when he returned to his tent eragon lay on his stomach and inspected the rings in the dim firelight that seeped past the entrance flaps
four bands looped through four bands
each was smooth on the bottom half and an asymmetrical wriggling mass on the top where it would weave through the other pieces
as eragon experimented with various configurations he quickly became frustrated by a simple fact it seemed impossible to get the two sets of bands parallel so they would lie flat together
absorbed by the challenge he forgot the terror he had just endured
eragon woke right before dawn
scrubbing the sleep from his eyes he exited the tent and stretched
his breath turned white in the brisk morning air
he nodded to shrrgnien who was keeping guard by the fire then strolled to the edge of the river and washed his face blinking from the shock of the cold water
he located saphira with a flick of his mind belted on zar roc and headed toward her through the beech trees that lined the az ragni
before long eragon is hands and face were slick with dew from a tangled wall of chokecherry bushes that obstructed his way
with an effort he pushed through the net of branches and escaped onto the silent plains
a round hill rose before him
on its crest like two ancient statues stood saphira and arya
they faced east where a molten glow crept into the sky and burnished the prairie amber
as the clear light struck the two figures eragon was reminded of how saphira had watched the sunrise from his bedpost only a few hours after she hatched
she was like a hawk or falcon with her hard sparkling eyes under their bony ridges the fierce arch of her neck and the lean strength etched into every line of her body
