it would not do to exhaust you when our survival may depend on your talents
i do not deceive myself you are more important than ** a sly grin crossed her face
besides if you remove your spell now i wo not be able to help any of the varden if they are threatened
you would not want nasuada to die because of that would you
no admitted eragon
he paused for a long time considering the issue then said very well i will wait
but i swear to you if we win this fight i shall right this wrong
the girl tilted her head to one side
i will hold you to your word rider
rising from her chair nasuada said elva was the one who saved me from an assassin in aberon
did she in that case i am in your debt
elva
for protecting my liegelord
come now said nasuada
i must introduce the three of you to orrin and his nobles
have you met the king before orik
the dwarf shook his head
i ve never been this far west
as they left the pavilion nasuada in the lead with elva by her side eragon tried to position himself so he could talk with arya but when he neared her she quickened her pace until she was level with nasuada
arya never even looked at him while she walked a slight that caused him more anguish than any physical wound he had endured
elva glanced back at him and he knew that she was aware of his distress
they soon arrived at another large pavilion this one white and yellow although it was difficult to determine the exact hue of the colors given the garish orange that glazed everything on the burning plains
once they were granted entrance eragon was astonished to find the tent crammed with an eccentric collection of beakers alembics retorts and other instruments of natural ** would bother toting all this onto a battlefield he wondered bewildered
eragon said nasuada i would like you to meet orrin son of larkin and monarch of the realm of surda
from the depths of the tangled piles of glass emerged a rather tall handsome man with shoulder length hair held back by the gold coronet resting upon his head
his mind like nasuada is was protected behind walls of iron it was obvious he had received extensive training in that skill
orrin seemed pleasant enough to eragon from their discussion if a bit green and untried when it came to commanding men in war and more than a little odd in the head
on the whole eragon trusted nasuada is leadership more
after fending off scores of questions from orrin about his stay among the elves eragon found himself smiling and nodding politely as one earl after another paraded past each of whom insisted on shaking his hand telling him what an honor it was to meet a rider and inviting him to their respective estates
eragon dutifully memorized their many names and titles as he knew oromis would expect and did his best to maintain a calm demeanor despite his growing frustration
we re about to engage one of the largest armies in history and here we are stuck exchanging pleasantries
patience counseled ** are not that many more
besides look at it this way if we win they will owe us an entire year of free dinners what with all their promises
he stifled a ** think it would dismay them to know what it takes to feed you
not to mention that you could empty their cellars of beer and wine in a single night
i would never she sniffed then ** in two nights
when at last they won free of orrin is pavilion eragon asked nasuada what shall i do now how can i serve you
nasuada eyed him with a curious expression
how doyou think you can best serve me eragon you know your own abilities far better than i ** even arya watched him now waiting to hear his response
eragon gazed up at the bloody sky while he pondered her question
i shall take control of du vrangr gata as they once asked me to and organize them underneath me so i can lead them into battle
working together will give us the best chance of foiling galbatorix is magicians
is there a place asked saphira where eragon can leave his bags i do not want to carry them or this saddle any longer than i have to
when eragon repeated her question nasuada said of course
