a red dragon floated above them glowing and sparkling in the sunbeam like a bed of blood red coals
his wing membranes were the color of wine held before a lantern
his claws and teeth and the spikes along his spine were white as snow
in his vermilion eyes there gleamed a terrible glee
on his back was fixed a saddle and in that saddle sat a man garbed in polished steel armor and armed with a hand and a half sword
dread clutched at ** managed to get another dragon to hatch
then the man in steel raised his left hand and a shaft of crackling ruby energy sprang from his palm and smote hrothgar on the breast
the dwarf spellcasters cried out with agony as the energy from their bodies was consumed trying to block the attack
they collapsed dead then hrothgar clutched his heart and toppled to the ground
the dwarves gave a great groan of despair as they saw their king fall
** cried eragon and saphira roared in protest
he glared with hate at the enemy ** will kill you for that
eragon knew that as they were he and saphira were too tired to confront such a mighty opponent
glancing around eragon spotted a horse lying in the mud a spear through its side
the stallion was still alive
eragon put his hand on its neck and murmured sleep brother
then he transferred the horse is remaining vitality into himself and saphira
it was not enough energy to restore all their strength but it soothed their aching muscles and stopped their limbs from shaking
rejuvenated eragon leaped onto saphira shouting orik take command of your ** across the field he saw arya gaze at him with concern
he put her out of his mind as he tightened the saddle straps around his legs
then saphira launched herself toward the red dragon pumping her wings at a furious rate to gain the necessary speed
i hope you remember your lessons with glaedr he said
he tightened his grip on his shield
saphira did not answer him but roared out with her thoughts at the other dragon ** egg breaker oath breaker ** then as one she and eragon assaulted the minds of the pair seeking to overwhelm their defenses
the consciousness of the rider felt strange to eragon as if it contained multitudes scores of distinct voices whispered in the caverns of his mind like imprisoned spirits begging for release
the instant they made contact the rider retaliated with a blast of pure force greater than any even oromis was capable of summoning
eragon retreated deep behind his own barriers frantically reciting a scrap of doggerel oromis taught him to use in such predicaments
under a cold and empty winter sk
stood a wee small man with a silver sword
he jumped and stabbed in a fevered frenzy
fighting the shadows massed before him
the siege on eragon is mind abated as saphira and the red dragon crashed together two incandescent meteors colliding head on
they grappled kicking each other is bellies with their hind legs
their talons produced hideous screeches as they grated against saphira is armor and the red dragon is flat scales
the red dragon was smaller than saphira but thicker in his legs and shoulders
he managed to kick her off for a moment then they closed again each struggling to get their jaws around the other is neck
it was all eragon could do to keep hold of zar roc as the dragons tumbled toward the ground battering one another with terrible blows from their feet and tails
no more than fifty yards above the burning plains saphira and the red dragon disengaged struggling to regain altitude
once she halted her descent saphira reared her head like a snake about to strike and loosed a thick torrent of fire
it never reached its destination twelve feet from the red dragon the fire bifurcated and passed harmlessly on either ** it thought eragon
even as the red dragon opened its maw to retaliate eragon cried skolir nosu fra ** he was just in time
the conflagration swirled around them but did not even scorch saphira is scales
now saphira and the red dragon raced up through the striated smoke into the clear chill sky beyond darting back and forth as they tried to climb above their opponent
