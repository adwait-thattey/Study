roran stood at the prow of thedragon wing and listened to the oars swish through the water
he had just finished a stint rowing and a cold jagged ache permeated his right ** i always have to deal with this reminder of the ra zac he wiped the sweat from his face and ignored the discomfort concentrating instead on the river ahead which was obscured by a bank of sooty clouds
elain joined him at the railing
she rested a hand on her swollen belly
the water looks evil she said
perhaps we should have stayed in dauth rather than drag ourselves in search of more trouble
he feared she spoke the truth
after the boar is eye they had sailed east from the southern isles back to the coast and then up the mouth of the jiet river to surda is port city of dauth
by the time they made landfall their stores were exhausted and the villagers sickly
roran had every intention of staying in dauth especially after they received an enthusiastic welcome from its governor lady alarice
but that was before he was told about galbatorix is army
if the varden were defeated he would never see katrina again
so with the help of jeod he convinced horst and many of the other villagers that if they wanted to live in surda safe from the empire they had to row up the jiet river and assist the varden
it was a difficult task but in the end roran prevailed
and once they told lady alarice about their quest she gave them all the supplies they wanted
since then roran often wondered if he made the right choice
by now everyone hated living on thedragon wing
people were tense and short tempered a situation only aggravated by the knowledge they were sailing toward a ** it all selfishness on my part wondered ** i really do this for the benefit of the villagers or only because it will bring me one step closer to finding katrina
perhaps we should have he said to elain
together they watched as a thick layer of smoke gathered overhead darkening the sky obscuring the sun and filtering the remaining light so that everything below was colored a nauseating hue of orange
it produced an eerie twilight the likes of which roran had never imagined
the sailors on deck looked about fearfully and muttered charms of protection pulling out stone amulets to ward off the evil eye
listen said elain
she tilted her head
what is that
roran strained his ears and caught the faint ring of metal striking metal
that he said is the sound of our ** twisting he shouted back over his shoulder captain there is fighting just **
man the ** roared uthar
double time on those oars bonden
an every able bodied man jack among you better be ready or you will be using your guts for **
roran remained where he was as thedragon wing exploded with activity
despite the increase in noise he could still hear swords and shields clanging together in the distance
the screams of men were audible now as were the roars of some giant beast
he glanced over as jeod joined them at the prow
the merchant is face was pale
have you ever been in battle before asked roran
the knob in jeod is throat bobbed as he swallowed and shook his head
i got into plenty of fights along with brom but never anything of this scale
a first for both of us then
the bank of smoke thinned on the right providing them with a glimpse of a dark land that belched forth fire and putrid orange vapor and was covered with masses of struggling men
it was impossible to tell who was the empire and who was the varden but it was apparent to roran that the battle could tip in either direction given the right ** can provide that nudge
then a voice echoed over the water as a man shouted a ** a ship is coming up the jiet **
you should go belowdecks said roran to elain
it wo not be safe for you ** she nodded and hurried to the fore hatchway where she climbed down the ladder closing the opening behind her
a moment later horst bounded up to the prow and handed roran one of fisk is shields
thought you might need that said horst
roran stopped as the air around them vibrated as if from a mighty **
his teeth jarred **
his ears hurt from the pressure
