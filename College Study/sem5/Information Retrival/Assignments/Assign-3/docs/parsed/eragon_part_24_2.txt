also if the enemy were to capture those houses and put their own archers on them it would be an easy matter to shoot them down
i ve never seen a city planned like this said eragon in wonder
yes but it was only done after teirm was nearly burned down by a pirate raid commented brom
as they continued up the street people gave them searching looks but there was not an undue amount of interest
compared to our reception at daret we ve been welcomed with open arms
perhaps teirm has escaped notice by the urgals thought eragon
he changed his opinion when a large man shouldered past them a sword hanging from his waist
there were other subtler signs of adverse times no children played in the streets people bore hard expressions and many houses were deserted with weeds growing from cracks in their stone covered yards
it looks like they ve had trouble said eragon
the same as everywhere else said brom grimly
we have to find ** they led their horses across the street to a tavern and tied them to the hitching post
the green chestnut
wonderful muttered brom looking at the battered sign above them as he and eragon entered the building
the dingy room felt unsafe
a fire smoldered in the fireplace yet no one bothered to throw more wood on it
a few lonely people in the corners nursed their drinks with sullen expressions
a man missing two fingers sat at a far table eyeing his twitching stumps
the bartender had a cynical twist to his lips and held a glass in his hand that he kept polishing even though it was broken
brom leaned against the bar and asked do you know where we can find a man called jeod eragon stood at his side fiddling with the tip of his bow by his waist
it was slung across his back but right then he wished that it were in his hands
the bartender said in an overly loud voice now why would i know something like that do you think i keep track of the mangy louts in this forsaken place eragon winced as all eyes turned toward them
brom kept talking smoothly
could you be enticed to remember he slid some coins onto the bar
the man brightened and put his glass down
could be he replied lowering his voice but my memory takes a great deal of ** brom is face soured but he slid more coins onto the bar
the bartender sucked on one side of his cheek undecidedly
all right he finally said and reached for the coins
before he touched them the man missing two fingers called out from his table gareth what in th blazes do you think you re doing anyone on the street could tell them where jeod lives
what are you charging them for
brom swept the coins back into his purse
gareth shot a venomous look at the man at the table then turned his back on them and picked up the glass again
brom went to the stranger and said thanks
the name is neal
this is evan
the man raised his mug to them
martin and of course you met ** his voice was deep and rough
martin gestured at some empty chairs
go ahead and sit down
i do not ** eragon took a chair and arranged it so his back was to the wall and he faced the door
martin raised an eyebrow but made no comment
you just saved me a few crowns said brom
my pleasure
ca not blame gareth though business has not been doing so well ** martin scratched his chin
jeod lives on the west side of town right next to angela the herbalist
do you have business with him
well he wo not be interested in buying anything he just lost another ship a few days ago
brom latched onto the news with interest
what happened it was not urgals was it
no said martin
they ve left the area
no one is seen em in almost a year
it seems they ve all gone south and east
but they are not the problem
see most of our business is through sea trade as i am sure you know
well he stopped to drink from his mug starting several months ago someone is been attacking our ships
it is not the usual piracy because only ships that carry the goods of certain merchants are attacked
jeod is one of em
it is gotten so bad that no captain will accept those merchants goods which makes life difficult around here
especially because some of em run the largest shipping businesses in the empire
