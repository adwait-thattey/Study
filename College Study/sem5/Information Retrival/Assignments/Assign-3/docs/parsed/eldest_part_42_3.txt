without a word oromis handed the tablet to arya
her hair obscured her face as she bowed over the tablet but eragon saw cords and veins ridge her hands as she clenched the slate
it shook in her grip
well what is it asked orik
raising the fairth over her head arya hurled it against the ground shattering the picture into a thousand pieces
then she drew herself upright and with great dignity walked past eragon across the clearing and into the tangled depths of du weldenvarden
orik picked up one of the fragments of slate
it was blank
the image had vanished when the tablet broke
he tugged his beard
in all the decades i ve known her arya has never lost her temper like that
never
what did you do eragon
dazed eragon said a portrait of her
orik frowned obviously puzzled
a portrait why would that
i think it would be best if you left now said oromis
the lesson is over in any case
come back tomorrow or the day after if you want a better idea of eragon is progress
the dwarf squinted at eragon then nodded and brushed the dirt from his palms
yes i believe i will do that
thank you for your time oromis elda
i appreciate ** as he headed back toward ellesmera he said over his shoulder to eragon i will be in the common room of tialdari hall if you want to talk
when orik was gone oromis lifted the hem of his tunic knelt and began to gather up the remains of the tablet
eragon watched him unable to move
why he asked in the ancient language
perhaps said oromis arya was frightened by you
frightened she never gets ** even as he said it eragon knew that it was not true
she just concealed her fear better than most
dropping to one knee he took a piece of the fairth and pressed it into oromis is palm
why would i frighten her he asked
please tell me
oromis stood and walked to the edge of the stream where he scattered the fragments of slate over the bank letting the gray flakes trickle through his fingers
fairths only show what you want them to
it is possible to lie with them to create a false image but to do so requires more skill than you yet have
arya knows this
she also knows then that your fairth was an accurate representation of your feelings for her
but why would that frighten her
oromis smiled sadly
because it revealed the depth of your ** he pressed his fingertips together forming a series of arches
let us analyze the situation eragon
while you are old enough to be considered a man among your people in our eyes you are no more than a ** eragon frowned hearing echoes of saphira is words from the previous night
normally i would not compare a human is age to an elf is but since you share our longevity you must also be judged by our standards
and you are a rider
we rely upon you to help us defeat galbatorix it could be disastrous for everyone in alagaesia if you are distracted from your studies
now then said oromis how should arya have responded to your fairth it is clear that you see her in a romantic light yet while i have no doubt arya is fond of you a union between the two of you is impossible due to your own youth culture race and responsibilities
your interest has placed arya in an uncomfortable position
she dare not confront you for fear of disrupting your training
but as the queen is daughter she cannot ignore you and risk offending a rider especially one upon which so much depends
even if you were a fit match arya would refrain from encouraging you so that you could devote all of your energy to the task at hand
she would sacrifice her happiness for the greater ** oromis is voice thickened you must understand eragon that slaying galbatorix is more important than any one person
nothing else ** he paused his gaze gentle then added given the circumstances is it so strange arya was frightened that your feelings for her could endanger everything we have worked for
eragon shook his head
he was ashamed that his behavior had caused arya distress and dismayed by how reckless and juvenile he had ** could have avoided this entire mess if i d just kept better control of myself
touching him on the shoulder oromis guided him back inside the hut
