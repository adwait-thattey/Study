an hour later he finished the rimgar
drying his palms on the corner of his tent he drew the falchion and practiced his swordsmanship for another thirty minutes
he would have preferred to continue familiarizing himself with the sword for the rest of the day for he knew his life might depend upon his skill with it but roran is wedding was fast approaching and the villagers could use all the help they could get if they were to complete the preparations in time
refreshed eragon bathed in cold water and dressed and then he and saphira walked to where elain was overseeing the cooking of roran and katrina is wedding feast
blodhgarm and his companions followed a dozen or so yards behind slipping between the tents with stealthy ease
ah good eragon elain said
i had hoped you would ** she stood with both her hands pressed into the small of her back to relieve the weight of her pregnancy
pointing with her chin past a row of spits and cauldrons suspended over a bed of coals past a clump of men butchering a hog past three makeshift ovens built of mud and stone and past a pile of kegs toward a line of planks set on stumps that six women were using as a counter she said there are still twenty loaves of bread dough that have to be kneaded
will you see to it please then she frowned at the calluses on his knuckles
and try not to get those in the dough wo not you
the six women standing at the planks which included felda and birgit fell silent when eragon took his place among them
his few attempts to restart the conversation failed but after a while when he had given up on putting them at ease and was concentrating on his kneading they resumed talking of their own accord
they spoke about roran and katrina and how lucky the two of them were and of the villagers life in the camp and of their journey thence and then without preamble felda looked over at eragon and said your dough looks a little sticky
should not you add some flour
eragon checked the consistency
you re right
thank ** felda smiled and after that the women included him in their conversation
while eragon worked the warm dough saphira lay basking on a nearby patch of grass
the children from carvahall played on and around her laughing shrieks punctuated the deeper thrum of the adults voices
when a pair of mangy dogs started barking at saphira she lifted her head off the ground and growled at them
they ran away yipping
everyone in the clearing was someone eragon had known while growing up
horst and fisk were on the other side of the spits constructing tables for the feast
kiselt was wiping the hog is blood off his forearms
albriech baldor mandel and several other of the younger men were carrying poles wound with ribbons toward the hill where roran and katrina wished to be married
the tavern keeper morn was off mixing the wedding drink with his wife tara holding three flagons and a cask for him
a few hundred feet away roran was shouting something at a mule driver who was attempting to run his charges through the clearing
loring delwin and the boy nolfavrell stood clustered nearby watching
with a loud curse roran grabbed the lead mule is harness and struggled to turn the animals around
the sight amused eragon he had never known roran to get so flustered nor to be so short tempered
the mighty warrior is nervous ere his contest observed isold one of the six women next to eragon
the group laughed
perhaps birgit said stirring water into flour he is worried his sword may bend in the ** gales of merriment swept the women
eragon is cheeks flushed
he kept his gaze fixed on the dough in front of him and increased the speed of his kneading
bawdy jokes were common at weddings and he had enjoyed his share before but hearing them directed at his cousin disconcerted him
the people who would not be able to attend the wedding were as much on eragon is mind as those who could
he thought of byrd quimby parr hida young elmund kelby and the others who had died because of the empire
but most of all he thought of garrow and wished his uncle were still alive to see his only son acclaimed a hero by the villagers and the varden alike and to see him take katrina is hand and finally become a man in full
