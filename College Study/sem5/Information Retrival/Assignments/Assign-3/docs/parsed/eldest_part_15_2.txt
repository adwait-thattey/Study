armor hung thickly on the walls along with racks of staff swords identical to the one angela had fought with in farthen dur
gannel was there sparring with three younger dwarves
the clan chief is robe was rucked up over his thighs so he could move freely his face a fierce scowl as the wood shaft spun in his hands unsharpened blades darting like riled hornets
two dwarves lunged at gannel only to be stymied in a clatter of wood and metal as he spun past them rapping their knees and heads and sending them to the floor
eragon grinned as he watched gannel disarm his last opponent in a brilliant flurry of blows
at last the clan chief noticed eragon and dismissed the other dwarves
as gannel set his weapon on a rack eragon said are all quan so proficient with the blade it seems an odd skill for priests
gannel faced him
we must be able to defend ourselves no many enemies stalk this land
eragon nodded
those are unique swords
i ve never seen their like except for one an herbalist used in the battle of farthen dur
the dwarf sucked in his breath then let it hiss out between his teeth
** his expression soured
she won her staff from a priest in a game of riddles
it was a nasty trick as we are the only ones allowed to use huthvirn
she and arya
he shrugged and went to a small table where he filled two mugs with ale
handing one to eragon he said i invited you here today at hrothgar is request
he told me that if you accepted his offer to become ingeitum i was to acquaint you with dwarf traditions
eragon sipped the ale and kept silent eyeing how gannel is thick brow caught the light shadows dripping down his cheeks from the bony ridge
the clan chief continued never before has an outsider been taught our secret beliefs nor may you speak of them to human or elf
yet without this knowledge you cannot uphold what it means to be knurla
you are ingeitum now our blood our flesh our honor
you understand
** keeping his ale in hand gannel took eragon from the sparring room and conveyed him through five grand corridors stopping in the archway to a dim chamber hazy with incense
facing them the squat outline of a statue swelled ponderously from floor to ceiling a faint light cast across the brooding dwarf face hacked with uncharacteristic crudeness from brown granite
who is he asked eragon intimidated
guntera king of the gods
he is a warrior and a scholar though fickle in his moods so we burn offerings to assure his affection at the solstices before sowing and at deaths and ** gannel twisted his hand in a strange gesture and bowed to the statue
it is to him we pray before battles for he molded this land from the bones of a giant and gives the world its order
all realms are guntera is
then gannel instructed eragon how to properly venerate the god explaining the signs and words that were used for homage
he elucidated the meaning of the incense how it symbolized life and happiness and spent long minutes recounting legends about guntera how the god was born fully formed to a she wolf at the dawn of stars how he had battled monsters and giants to win a place for his kin in alagaesia and how he had taken kilf the goddess of rivers and the sea as his mate
next they went to kilf is statue which was carved with exquisite delicacy out of pale blue stone
her hair flew back in liquid ripples rolling down her neck and framing merry amethyst eyes
in her hands she cupped a water lily and a chunk of porous red rock that eragon did not recognize
what is that he asked pointing
coral taken from deep within the sea that borders the beors
gannel took a draught of ale then said our divers found it while searching for pearls
it seems that in brine certain stones grow like plants
eragon stared with wonder
he had never thought of pebbles or boulders as alive yet here was proof that all they needed was water and salt to flourish
it finally explained how rocks had continued to appear in their fields in palancar valley even after the soil had been combed clean each ** grew
they proceeded to urur master of the air and heavens and his brother morgothal god of fire
