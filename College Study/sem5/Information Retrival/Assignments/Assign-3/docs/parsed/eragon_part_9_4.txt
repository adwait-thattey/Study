brom did not respond at once
his chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe thoughtfully light reflecting off his ring
sorry my mind was elsewhere
yes a dragon will live for quite a while forever in fact as long as it is not killed and its rider does not die
how does anyone know that objected eragon
if dragons die when their riders do they could only live to be sixty or seventy
you said during your
narration that riders lived for hundreds of years but that is ** it troubled him to think of outliving his family and friends
a quiet smile curled brom is lips as he said slyly what is possible is subjective
some would say that you cannot travel through the spine and live yet you do
it is a matter of perspective
you must be very wise to know so much at such a young ** eragon flushed and the old man chuckled
do not be angry you can not be expected to know such things
you forget that the dragons were magical they affected everything around them in strange ways
the riders were closest to them and experienced this the most
the most common side effect was an extended life
our king has lived long enough to make that apparent but most people attribute it to his own magical abilities
there were also other less noticeable changes
all the riders were stronger of body keener of mind and truer of sight than normal men
along with this a human rider would slowly acquire pointed ears though they were never as prominent as an elf is
eragon had to stop his hand from reaching up to feel the tips of his ** else will this dragon change my life not only has it gotten inside my head but it is altering my body as ** were dragons very smart
did not you pay attention to what i told you ** demanded brom
how could the elves form agreements and peace treaties with dumb brutes they were as intelligent as you or i
but they were animals persisted eragon
brom snorted
they were no more animals than we are
for some reason people praise everything the riders did yet ignore the dragons assuming that they were nothing more than an exotic means to get from one town to another
they were not
the riders great deeds were only possible because of the dragons
how many men would draw their swords if they knew a giant fire breathing lizard one with more natural cunning and wisdom than even a king could hope for would soon be there to stop the violence hmm he blew another smoke ring and watched it waft away
nay said brom it was long before my time
and now for a ** i ve been trying to recall the name of a certain dragon but it keeps eluding me
i think i heard it when the traders were in carvahall but i am not sure
could you help me
brom shrugged and quickly listed a stream of names
there was jura hirador and fundor who fought the giant sea snake
galzra briam ohen the strong gretiem beroan roslarb
he added many others
at the very end he uttered so softly eragon almost did not hear
and ** brom quietly emptied his pipe
was it any of those
i am afraid not said eragon
brom had given him much to think about and it was getting late
well roran is probably finished with horst
i should get back though i d rather not
brom raised an eyebrow
what is that it i expected to be answering your questions until he came looking for you
no queries about dragon battle tactics or requests for descriptions of breathtaking aerial combat are we done
for now laughed eragon
i learned what i wanted to and ** he stood and brom followed
very well ** he ushered eragon to the door
goodbye
take care
and do not forget if you remember who that trader was tell me
i will
thank ** eragon stepped into the glaring winter sunlight squinting
he slowly paced away pondering what he had heard
