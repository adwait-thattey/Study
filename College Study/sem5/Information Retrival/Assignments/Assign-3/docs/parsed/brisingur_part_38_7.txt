but you will have to kill me with a blade your crossbows are of no use against me
come now you slugs you leeches you starving white bellied ** come and best me if you **
with a flurry of battle cries a group of thirty soldiers dropped their crossbows drew their flashing swords and with shields held high ran toward roran and his men
from over his right shoulder roran heard harald say sir there are many more of them than us
aye roran said keeping his eyes fixed on the approaching soldiers
four of them stumbled and then lay motionless on the ground pierced through by numerous shafts
if they all charge us at once we wo not stand a chance
yes but they wo not
look they re confused and disorganized
their commander must have fallen
as long as we maintain order they cannot overwhelm us
but stronghammer we cannot kill that many men **
roran glanced back at harald
of course we ** we fight to protect our families and to reclaim our homes and our lands
they fight because galbatorix forces them to
they have not the heart for this battle
so think of your families think of your homes and remember it is they you are defending
a man who fights for something greater than himself may kill a hundred enemies with ** as he spoke roran saw in his mind an image of katrina clad in her blue wedding dress and he smelled the scent of her skin and he heard the muted tones of her voice from their discussions late at night
then the soldiers were upon them and for a span roran heard nothing but the thud of swords bouncing off his shield and the clang of his hammer as he struck the soldiers helms and the cries of the soldiers as they crumpled underneath his blows
the soldiers threw themselves against him with desperate strength but they were no match for him or his men
when he vanquished the last of the attacking soldiers roran burst out laughing exhilarated
what a joy it was to crush those who would harm his wife and his unborn child
he was pleased to see that none of his warriors had been seriously injured
he also noticed that during the fray several of the archers had descended from the roofs to fight on horseback with them
roran grinned at the newcomers and said welcome to the **
a warm welcome ** one of them replied
pointing with his gore covered hammer toward the right side of the street roran said you you and you pile the bodies over there
make a funnel out of them and the wagon so that only two or three soldiers can get to us at once
yes ** the warriors answered swinging down from their horses
a quarrel whizzed toward roran
he ignored it and focused on the main body of soldiers where a group perhaps a hundred strong was massing in preparation for a second onslaught
** he shouted to the men shifting the corpses
they re almost upon us
harald go help
roran wet his lips nervous as he watched his men labor while the soldiers advanced
to his relief the four varden dragged the last body into place and clambered back onto their steeds moments before the wave of soldiers struck
the houses on either side of the street as well as the overturned wagon and the gruesome barricade of human remains slowed and compressed the flow of soldiers until they were nearly at a standstill when they reached roran
the soldiers were packed so tightly they were helpless to escape the arrows that streaked toward them from above
the first two ranks of soldiers carried spears with which they menaced roran and the other varden
roran parried three separate thrusts cursing the whole while as he realized that he could not reach past the spears with his hammer
then a soldier stabbed snowfire in the shoulder and roran leaned forward to keep from being thrown as the stallion squealed and reared
as snowfire landed on all fours roran slid out of the saddle keeping the stallion between him and the hedge of spear wielding soldiers
snowfire bucked as another spear pierced his hide
before the soldiers could wound him again roran pulled on snowfire is reins and forced him to prance backward until there was enough room among the other horses for the stallion to turn around
