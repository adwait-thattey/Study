i thought you were a foe of the empire yet here i find you bearing one of the forsworn is bloody **
eragon stared at zar roc with shock
he realized that brom must have taken it from morzan after they fought in gil ead
brom never told me where it came from he said truthfully
i had no idea it was morzan is
he never told you asked murtagh a note of disbelief in his voice
eragon shook his head
that is strange
i can think of no reason for him to have concealed it
neither can i
but then he kept many secrets said eragon
it felt unsettling to hold the sword of the man who had betrayed the riders to ** blade probably killed many riders in its time he thought with ** worse ** even so i am going to carry it
i do not have a sword of my own
until such time as i get one i will use zar roc
murtagh flinched as eragon said the name
it is your choice he said
he returned to skinning keeping his gaze focused downward
when the meal was ready eragon ate slowly though he was quite hungry
the hot food made him feel better
as they scraped out their bowls he said i have to sell my horse
why not brom is asked murtagh
he seemed to have gotten over his bad temper
snowfire because brom promised to take care of him
since he
is not around i will do it for him
murtagh set his bowl on his lap
if that is what you want i am sure we can find a buyer in some town or village
murtagh looked at him sideways in a calculating way
you wo not want to stay here for much longer
if the ra zac are nearby brom is tomb will be like a beacon for ** eragon had not thought of that
and your ribs are going to take time to heal
i know you can defend yourself with magic but you need a companion who can lift things and use a sword
i am asking to travel with you at least for the time being
but i must warn you the empire is searching for me
there will be blood over it eventually
eragon laughed weakly and found himself crying because it hurt so much
once his breath was back he said i do not care if the entire army is searching for you
you re right
i do need help
i would be glad to have you along though i have to talk to saphira about it
but i have to warnyou galbatorix justmight send the entire army after me
you wo not be any safer with saphira and me than if you were on your own
i know that said murtagh with a quick grin
but all the same it wo not stop me
while they spoke saphira crawled into the cave and greeted eragon
she was glad to see him but there was deep sadness in her thoughts and words
she laid her big blue head on the floor and asked are you well again
as do i
i never suspected that he was a rider
** he really was an old man as old as the forsworn
everything he taught me about magic he must have learned from the riders themselves
saphira shifted ** knew what he was the moment he touched me at your farm
and you did not tell me why
he asked me not to she said simply
eragon decided not to make an issue of it
saphira never meant to hurt him
brom kept more than that secret he told her then explained about zar roc and murtagh is reaction to ** understand now why brom did not explain zar roc is origins when he gave it to me
if he had i probably would have run away from him at the first opportunity
you would do well to rid yourself of that sword she said with ** know it is a peerless weapon but you would be better off with a normal blade rather than morzan is butchery tool
perhaps
saphira where does our path go from here murtagh offered to come with us
i do not know his past but he seems honest enough
should we go to the varden now only i do not know how to find them
brom never told us
eragon grew ** did he trust you but not me with all this knowledge
her scales rustled over the dry rock as she stood above him eyes ** we left teirm and were attacked by the urgals he told me many things some of which i will not speak of unless necessary
he was concerned about his own death and what would happen to you after it
one fact he imparted to me was the name of a man dormnad who lives in gil ead
he can help us find the varden
brom also wanted you to know that of all the people in alagaesia he believed you were the best suited to inherit the riders legacy
