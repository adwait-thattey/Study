they forged deeper into dras leona leaving the squalid entrance behind
as they entered wealthier parts of the city eragon wondered how can these people live in ease when the suffering around them is so obvious
they found lodging at the golden globe which was cheap but not decrepit
a narrow bed was crammed against one wall of the room with a rickety table and a basin alongside it
eragon took one look at the mattress and said i am sleeping on the floor
there are probably enough bugs in that thing to eat me alive
well i would not want to deprive them of a meal said brom dropping his bags on the mattress
eragon set his own on the floor and pulled off his bow
we find food and beer
after that sleep
tomorrow we can start looking for the ra ** before they left the room brom warned no matter what happens make sure that your tongue does not loosen
we will have to leave immediately if we re given away
the inn is food was barely adequate but its beer was excellent
by the time they stumbled back to the room eragon is head was buzzing pleasantly
he unrolled his blankets on the floor and slid under them as brom tumbled onto the bed
just before eragon fell asleep he contacted saphira we re going to be here for a few days but this should not take as long as it did at teirm
when we discover where the ra zac are you might be able to help us get them
i will talk to you in the morning
right now i am not thinking too clearly
you ve been drinking came the accusing thought
eragon considered it for a moment and had to agree that she was absolutely right
her disapproval was clear but all she said was i wo not envy you in the morning
no groaned eragon but brom will
he drank twice as much as i did
