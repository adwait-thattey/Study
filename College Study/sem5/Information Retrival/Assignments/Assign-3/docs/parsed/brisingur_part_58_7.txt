saphira swept down from on high and cleared the parapet above the portcullis with a jet of billowing fire smoke venting from her nostrils
she dropped onto the top of the wall jarring eragon and said go
i will see to the catapults before they start lobbing rocks at the varden
be careful
he lowered himself to the parapet from her back
it is they who must be ** she replied
she snarled at the pikemen gathering around the catapults
half of them turned and fled inside
the wall was too high for eragon to comfortably jump to the street below so saphira draped her tail over the side and wedged it between two merlons
eragon sheathed brisingr then climbed down using the spikes on her tail like rungs on a ladder
when he reached the tip he released his hold and fell the remaining twenty feet
he rolled to lessen the impact as he landed amid the press of varden
greetings shadeslayer said blodhgarm emerging from the crowd along with the eleven other elves
** eragon drew brisingr again
why have not you already opened the gate for the varden
the gate is protected by many spells shadeslayer
it would require much strength to break and shatter
my companions and i are here to protect you and saphira and we cannot fulfill our duty if we exhaust ourselves on other tasks
biting back a curse eragon said would you rather saphira and i exhaust ourselves blodhgarm will that make us safer
the elf stared at eragon for a moment his yellow eyes inscrutable then he bowed his head slightly
we shall open the gate at once shadeslayer
no do not growled eragon
wait here
eragon pushed his way to the front of the varden and strode toward the lowered portcullis
give me ** he shouted gesturing at the warriors
the varden backed away from him forming an open area twenty feet across
a javelin shot from a ballista glanced off his wards and flew spinning down a side street
saphira roared from inside the courtyard and there came the sounds of timbers breaking and of taut rope snapping in twain
grasping his sword with both hands eragon lifted it overhead and shouted ** the blade burst into blue fire and the warriors behind him uttered exclamations of amazement
eragon stepped forward then and smote one of the crossbars of the portcullis
a blinding flash lit the wall and surrounding buildings as the sword sliced through the thick piece of metal
at the same time eragon noticed a sudden increase in his fatigue as brisingr severed the wards protecting the portcullis
he smiled
as he had hoped the spells of countermagic with which rhunon had imbued brisingr were more than sufficient to defeat the enchantments
moving at a quick but steady pace eragon cut as large a hole as he could in the portcullis then stood aside as the loose piece of grating fell flat onto the stones of the street with a discordant clang
he stepped past the grating and walked forward to the oaken doors recessed farther within the curtain wall
he aligned brisingr with the hairline crack between the two doors put his weight behind the sword and pushed the blade through the narrow gap and out the other side
then he increased the flow of energy to the fire blazing around the blade until it was hot enough to burn its way through the dense wood as easily as a knife cuts through fresh bread
copious amounts of smoke billowed from around the blade making his throat sting and his eyes smart
eragon worked the sword upward burning through the immense wooden beam that barred the doors shut from the inside
as soon as he felt the resistance against brisingr is blade lessen he withdrew the sword and extinguished the flame
he wore thick gloves so he did not shrink from grasping the glowing edges of one door and pulling it open with a mighty heave
the other door also swung outward seemingly of its own accord although a moment later eragon saw that it was saphira who had pushed it open she sat to the right of the entryway peering at him with sparkling sapphire eyes
behind her the four catapults lay in ruins
eragon went to stand with saphira as the varden poured into the courtyard filling the air with their clamorous battle cries
