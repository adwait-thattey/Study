i suppose i will have to reward her for her assistance with a place within my council at the very least
it may be for the ** said eragon straining to make himself heard over the commotion
if the vrenshrrgn are equal to their name we shall have great need of them before we reach the gates of uru baen
orik started to answer but then a long low note of portentous volume reverberated throughout the floor and the ceiling and the air of the room causing eragon is bones to vibrate with its force
** cried orik and raised a hand
the group fell silent
four times in total the bass note sounded shaking the room with each repetition as if a giant were pounding against the side of tronjheim
afterward orik said i never thought to hear the drums of derva announce mine kingship
how large are the drums asked eragon awed
close to fifty feet across if memory serves
it occurred to eragon that although the dwarves were the shortest of the races they built the biggest structures in alagaesia which seemed odd to him
perhaps he thought by making such enormous objects they do not feel so small themselves
he almost mentioned his theory to orik but at the last moment decided that it might offend him so he held his tongue
closing ranks around him orik is attendants began to consult with him in dwarvish often speaking over one another in a loud tangle of voices and eragon who had been about to ask orik another question found himself relegated to a corner
he tried to wait patiently for a lull in the conversation but after a few minutes it became plain the dwarves were not about to stop plying orik with questions and advice for such he assumed was the nature of their discourse
therefore eragon said orik konungr and he imbued the ancient language word for king with energy that it would capture the attention of everyone present
the room fell silent and orik looked at eragon and lifted an eyebrow
your majesty may i have your permission to withdraw there is a certain
matter i would like to attend to if it is not already too late
comprehension brightened orik is brown eyes
by all means make ** but you need not call me majesty eragon nor sire nor by any other title
we are friends and foster brothers after all
we are your majesty eragon replied but for the time being i believe it is only proper i should observe the same courtesies as everyone else
you are the king of your race now and my own king as well seeing as how i am a member of durgrimst ingeitum and that is not something i can ignore
orik studied him for a moment as if from a great distance and then nodded and said as you wish shadeslayer
eragon bowed and left the room
accompanied by his four guards he bounded through the tunnels and up the stairs that led to the ground floor of tronjheim
once they arrived at the southern branch of the four main hallways that divided the city mountain eragon turned to thrand the captain of his guards and said i mean to run the rest of the way
since you wo not be able to keep pace with me i suggest you stop when you reach the south gate of tronjheim and wait there for my return
thrand said argetlam please you should not go alone
cannot i convince you to slow yourself so we can accompany you we may not be as fleet as the elves but we can run from sunup to sundown and in full armor too
i appreciate your concern said eragon but i would not tarry a minute longer even if i knew there were assassins hiding behind every pillar
**
and with that he dashed down the broad hallway dodging around the dwarves who blocked his way
