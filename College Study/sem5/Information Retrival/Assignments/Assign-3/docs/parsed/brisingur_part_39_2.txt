saphira blinked once feeling no inclination to answer with words
after glancing around nasuada stepped closer to saphira is head and whispered saphira i must speak to you in private
you can reach into my mind but i cannot reach into yours
can you remain inside me so i can think what i need to say and you will hear
extending herself toward the woman is tense hard tired consciousness saphira allowed her irritation at being kept from her sleep to wash over nasuada and then she said i can if i so choose but i would never do so without your permission
of course nasuada replied
i understand
at first saphira received nothing but disjointed images and emotions from the woman a gallows with an empty noose blood on the ground snarling faces dread weariness and an undercurrent of grim determination
forgive me said nasuada
i have had a trying morning
if my thoughts wander overmuch please bear with me
saphira blinked again
what is it that has stirred up the varden so a group of men roused me from my sleep with their ill tempered wrangling and before that i heard an unusual number of messengers racing through the camp
pressing her lips together nasuada turned away from saphira and crossed her arms cradling her healing forearms with cupped hands
the coloring of her mind became black as a midnight cloud full of intimations of death and violence
after an uncharacteristically long pause she said one of the varden a man by the name of othmund crept into the urgals camp last night and killed three of them while they were asleep around their fire
the urgals failed to catch othmund at the time but this morning he claimed credit for the deed and was boasting of it throughout the army
why did he do this saphira asked
did the urgals kill his family
nasuada shook her head
i almost wish they had because then the urgals would not be so upset revenge at least they understand
no that is the strange part of this affair othmund hates the urgals for no other reason than they are urgals
they have never wronged him nor his kin and yet he loathes urgals with every fiber of his body
or so i gather after having spoken with him
how will you deal with him
nasuada looked at saphira again a profound sadness in her eyes
he will hang for his crimes
when i accepted the urgals into the varden i decreed that anyone who attacked an urgal would be punished as if he had attacked a fellow human
i cannot go back on my word now
no
the men needed to know i would not condone such acts
otherwise they might have turned against the urgals the very day nar garzhvog and i made our pact
now however i must show them i meant what i said
if i do not there will be even more murders and then the urgals will take matters into their own hands and once again our two races shall be snapping at each other is throats
it is only right othmund should die for killing the urgals and for defying my order but oh saphira the varden will not like this
i have sacrificed my own flesh to win their loyalty but now they will hate me for hanging othmund
they will hate me for equating the lives of urgals with the lives of humans
lowering her arms nasuada tugged at the cuffs of her sleeves
and i cannot say i like it any more than they will
for all my attempts to treat the urgals openly and fairly and as equals as my father would have i cannot help but remember how they killed him
i cannot help but remember the sight of all those urgals slaughtering the varden during the battle of farthen dur
i cannot help but remember the many stories i heard when i was a child stories of urgals sweeping out of the mountains and murdering innocent people in their beds
always urgals were the monsters to be feared and here i have joined our fate with theirs
i cannot help but remember all that saphira and i find myself wondering if i have made the right decision
you cannot help but be human said saphira attempting to comfort nasuada
yet you do not have to be bound by what those around you believe
you can grow beyond the limits of your race if you have the will
if the events of the past can teach us anything it is that the kings and queens and other leaders who have brought the races closer together are the ones who have accomplished the greatest good in alagaesia
