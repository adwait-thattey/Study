surprise and a deep inconsolable pain sprang onto sloan is vulnerable face along with the glimmer of tears
for a moment roran felt sympathy for him then a series of contortions distorted sloan is visage each more extreme than the last until his skin turned beet red
he cursed and said you two faced ** how could you look me in the eye and speak to me like an honest man while at the same time courting my daughter without permission i dealt with you in good faith and here i find you plundering my house while my back is turned
i had hoped to do this properly said roran but events have conspired against me
it was never my intention to cause you grief
even though this has not gone the way either of us wanted i still want your blessing if you are willing
i would rather have a maggot riddled pig for a son than ** you have no farm
you have no family
and you will have naught to do with my ** the butcher cursed again
and she will have naught to do with the **
sloan reached for katrina but roran blocked the way his face as hard as his clenched fists
only a handsbreadth apart they stared directly at each other trembling from the strength of their emotions
sloan is red rimmed eyes shone with manic intensity
roran withdrew from sloan so that the three of them formed a triangle and looked at katrina
tears streamed down her face as she glanced between him and her father
she stepped forward hesitated then with a long anguished cry tore at her hair in a frenzy of indecision
** exclaimed sloan with a burr of fear
at the sound of his voice katrina is tears ceased and she stood straight and tall with a calm expression
she said i am sorry father but i have decided to marry roran and stepped to his side
sloan turned bone white
he bit his lip so hard that a bead of ruby blood appeared
you can not leave ** you re my ** he lunged at her with crooked hands
in that instant roran bellowed and struck the butcher with all his strength knocking him sprawling in the dirt before the entire village
sloan rose slowly his face and neck flushed with humiliation
when he saw katrina again the butcher seemed to crumple inward losing height and stature until roran felt as if he were looking at a specter of the original man
in a low whisper he said it is always so those closest to the heart cause the most pain
thou will have no dowry from me snake nor your mother is ** weeping bitterly sloan turned and fled toward his shop
katrina leaned against roran and he put an arm around her
together they clung to each other as people crowded against them offering condolences advice congratulations and disapproval
despite the commotion roran was aware of nothing but the woman whom he held and who held him
just then elain bustled up as fast as her pregnancy would allow
oh you poor ** she cried and embraced katrina drawing her from roran is arms
is it true you are engaged katrina nodded and smiled then erupted into hysterical tears against elain is shoulder
there now there ** elain cradled katrina gently petting her and trying to soothe her but without avail every time roran thought she was about to recover katrina began to cry with renewed intensity
finally elain peered over katrina is quaking shoulder and said i am taking her back to the house
no you wo not retorted elain
she needs time to calm down and you have work to do
do you want my advice roran nodded dumbly
stay away until evening
i guarantee that she will be as right as rain by then
she can join the others ** without waiting for his response elain escorted the sobbing katrina away from the wall of sharpened trees
roran stood with his hands hanging limply by his sides feeling dazed and ** have we done he regretted that he had not revealed their engagement to sloan sooner
he regretted that he and sloan could not work together to shield katrina from the empire
and he regretted that katrina had been forced to relinquish her only family for him
he was now doubly responsible for her welfare
they had no choicebut to get ** ve made a terrible mess of this
he sighed and clenched his fist wincing as his bruised knuckles stretched
