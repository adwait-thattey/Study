good then we can still cover a few miles today
brom pointed off to the side
over there a ways
i picketed them where there was ** eragon prepared to leave then followed brom to the horses
saphira said pointedly if you had explained what you were planning to do none of this would have happened
i would have told you it was a bad idea not to kill the urgals
i only agreed to do what you asked because i assumed it was halfway reasonable
i do not want to talk about it
as they rode every bump and dip in the trail made eragon grit his teeth with discomfort
if he had been alone he would have stopped
with brom there he dared not complain
also brom started drilling him with difficult scenarios involving urgals magic and saphira
the imagined fights were many and varied
sometimes a shade or other dragons were included
eragon discovered that it was possible to torture his body and mind at the same time
he got most of the questions wrong and became increasingly frustrated
when they stopped for the night brom grumbled shortly it was a ** eragon knew that he was disappointed
the next day was easier on both of them
eragon felt better and was able to answer more of brom is questions correctly
after an especially difficult exercise eragon mentioned his scrying of the woman
brom pulled on his beard
you say she was imprisoned
did you see her face asked brom intently
not very clearly
the lighting was bad yet i could tell that she was beautiful
it is strange i did not have any problem seeing her eyes
and she did look at me
brom shook his head
as far as i know it is impossible for anyone to know if they re being scryed upon
do you know who she might be asked eragon surprised by the eagerness in his own voice
not really admitted brom
if pressed i suppose i could come up with a few guesses but none of them would be very likely
this dream of yours is peculiar
somehow you managed to scry in your sleep something that you d never seen before without saying the words of power
dreams do occasionally touch the spirit realm but this is different
perhaps to understand this we should search every prison and dungeon until we find the woman bantered eragon
he actually thought it would be a good idea
brom laughed and rode on
brom is strict training filled nearly every hour as the days slowly blended into weeks
because of his splint eragon was forced to use his left hand whenever they sparred
before long he could duel as well with his left hand as he had with his right
by the time they crossed the spine and came to the plains spring had crept over alagaesia summoning a multitude of flowers
the bare deciduous trees were russet with buds while new blades of grass began to push up between last year is dead stalks
birds returned from their winter absence to mate and build nests
the travelers followed the toark river southeast along the edge of the spine
it grew steadily as tributaries flowed into it from every side feeding its bulging girth
when the river was over a league wide brom pointed at the silt islands that dotted the water
we re close to leona lake now he said
it is only about two leagues away
do you think we can get there before nightfall asked eragon
dusk soon made the trail hard to follow but the sound of the river at their side guided them
when the moon rose the bright disk provided enough light to see what lay ahead
leona lake looked like a thin sheet of silver beaten over the land
the water was so calm and smooth it did not even seem to be liquid
aside from a bright strip of moonlight reflecting off the surface it was indistinguishable from the ground
saphira was on the rocky shore fanning her wings to dry them
eragon greeted her and she said the water is lovely deep cool and clear
maybe i will go swimming tomorrow he responded
they set up camp under a stand of trees and were soon asleep
at dawn eragon eagerly rushed out to see the lake in daylight
a whitecapped expanse of water rippled with fan shaped patterns where wind brushed it
the pure size of it delighted him
he whooped and ran to the ** where are you let is have some fun
