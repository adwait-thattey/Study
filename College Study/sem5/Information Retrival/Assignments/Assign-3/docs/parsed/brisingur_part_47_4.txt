saphira he asked puzzled
tell me what
she ignored him
this arguing is without cause
do not prolong eragon is discomfort anymore
one of oromis is slanted eyebrows rose
you know
you know what eragon bellowed on the verge of tearing his sword from its sheath and threatening all of them until they explained themselves

look into your heart eragon said glaedr
you already know who he is and you have known for a long time
eragon shook his head
i do not ** i do not ** please
a gout of smoke and flame jetted from glaedr is nostrils as he snorted
is it not obvious your father is brom
