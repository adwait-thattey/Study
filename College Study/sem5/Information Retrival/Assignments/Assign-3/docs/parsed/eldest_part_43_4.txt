you were the right person at the right place at the right time
never forget that
if ever that were true he said it was before durza injured me
now i see naught but darkness and evil in our future
i wo not give up but i despair that we may not prevail
perhaps our task is not to overthrow galbatorix but to prepare the way for the next rider chosen by the remaining eggs
at the crags of tel naeir eragon found oromis at the table in his hut painting a landscape with black ink along the bottom edge of a scroll he had finished writing
fifteen minutes elapsed before oromis finished limning the tufts of needles on a gnarled juniper tree laid aside his ink cleaned his sable brush with water from a clay pot and then addressed eragon saying why have you come so early
i apologize for disturbing you but vanir abandoned our contest partway through and i did not know what to do with myself
oromis folded his hands in his lap while eragon described the encounter ending with i should not have lost control but i did and i looked all the more foolish because of it
i have failed you master
you have agreed oromis
vanir may have goaded you but that was no reason to respond in kind
you must keep a better hold over your emotions eragon
it could cost you your life if you allow your temper to sway your judgment during battle
also such childish displays do nothing but vindicate those elves who are opposed to you
our machinations are subtle and allow little room for such errors
i am sorry master
it wo not happen again
as oromis seemed content to wait in his chair until the time when they normally performed the rimgar eragon seized the opportunity to ask how could vanir have worked magic without speaking
did he perhaps another elf decided to assist him
eragon shook his head
during my first day in ellesmera i also saw islanzadi summon a downpour of flowers by clapping her hands nothing more
and vanir said that i did not understand how magic works
what did he mean
once again said oromis resigned you grasp at knowledge that you are not prepared for
yet because of our circumstances i cannot deny it to you
only know this that which you ask for was not taught to riders and is not taught to our magicians until they had and have mastered every other aspect of magic for this is the secret to the true nature of magic and the ancient language
those who know it may acquire great power yes but at a terrible ** he paused for a moment
how is the ancient language bound to magic eragon vodhr
the words of the ancient language can release the energy stored within your body and thus activate a spell
ah
then you mean that certain sounds certain vibrations in the air somehow tap into this energy sounds that might be produced at random by any creature or thing
confused eragon said it does not matter if it seems absurd master it just is
should i think it absurd that the moon wanes and waxes or that the seasons turn or that birds fly south in the winter
of course not
but how could mere sound do so much can particular patterns of pitch and volume really trigger reactions that allow us to manipulate energy
sound has no control over magic
saying a word or phrase in this language is not what is important it isthinking them in this ** with a flick of his wrist a golden flame appeared over oromis is palm then disappeared
however unless the need is dire we still utter our spells out loud to prevent stray thoughts from disrupting them which is a danger to even the most experienced magic user
the implications staggered eragon
he thought back to when he almost drowned under the waterfall of the lake kostha merna and how he had been unable to access magic because of the water surrounding ** i had known this then i could have saved myself he thought
master he said if sound does not affect magic why then do thoughts
now oromis smiled
why indeed i must point out that we ourselves are not the source of magic
magic can exist on its own independent of any spell such as the werelights in the bogs by aroughs the dream well in mani is caves in the beor mountains and the floating crystal on eoam
