that night eragon is uncertainties burst forth in his waking dreams which raged like a wounded bear through his mind tearing disparate images from his memories and mixing them into such a clamor he felt as if he were transported back into the confusion of the battle under farthen ** saw garrow lying dead in horst is house then brom dead in the lonely sandstone cave and then the face of angela the herbalist who whispered beware argetlam betrayal is clear
and it will come from within your family
beware **
then the crimson sky was torn apart and eragon again beheld the two armies from his premonition in the beor mountains
the banks of warriors collided upon an orange and yellow field accompanied by the harsh screams of gore crows and the whistle of black arrows
the earth itself seemed to burn green flames belched from scorched holes that dotted the ground charring the mangled corpses left in the armies wake
he heard the roar of a gigantic beast from above that rapidly app
eragon jolted upright in bed and scrabbled at the dwarf necklace which burned at his throat
using his tunic to protect his hand he pulled the silver hammer away from his skin and then sat and waited in the dark his heart thudding from the surprise
he felt his strength ebb as gannel is spell thwarted whoever was trying to scry him and saphira
once again he wondered if galbatorix himself was behind the spell or if it was one of the king is pet magicians
eragon frowned and released the hammer as the metal grew cold ** is wrong
i know that much and i ve known it for a while as has saphira
too uneasy to resume the trancelike state that had replaced sleep for him he crept from their bedroom without waking saphira and climbed the spiral staircase to the study
there he unshuttered a white lantern and read one of analisia is epics until sunrise in an attempt to calm himself
just as eragon put away the scroll blagden flew through the open portal in the eastern wall and with a flutter of wings landed on the corner of the carved writing desk
the white raven fixed his beady eyes on eragon and croaked **
eragon inclined his head
and may the stars watch over you master blagden
the raven hopped closer
he cocked his head to the side and uttered a barking cough as if he were clearing his throat then recited in his hoarse voice
what does that mean asked eragon
blagden shrugged and repeated the verse
when eragon still pressed him for an explanation the bird ruffled his feathers appearing displeased and cackled son and father alike both as blind as bats
** exclaimed eragon jolting upright
do you know my father who is he
blagden cackled again
this time he seemed to be laughing
and one of two is certainly one
a name blagden
give me a ** when the raven remained silent eragon reached out with his mind intending to wrench the information from the bird is memories
blagden was too wily however
he deflected eragon is probe with a flick of his thoughts
shrieking ** he darted forward plucked a bright glass stopper from an inkwell and sped away with his trophy clutched in his beak
he dove out of sight before eragon could cast a spell to bring him back
eragon is stomach knotted as he tried to decipher blagden is two riddles
the last thing he had expected was to hear his father mentioned in ellesmera
finally he muttered that is ** i will find blagden later and wring the truth out of him
but right now
i would have to be a half wit to ignore these portents
he jumped to his feet and ran down the stairs waking saphira with his mind and telling her what had transpired during the night
retrieving his shaving mirror from the wash closet eragon sat between saphira is two front paws so that she could look over his head and see what he saw
arya wo not appreciate it if we intrude on her privacy warned saphira
i have to know if she is safe
saphira accepted that without ** will you find her you said that after her imprisonment she erected wards that like your necklace prevent anyone from scrying her
if i can scry the people she is with i might be able to figure out how arya ** on an image of nasuada eragon passed his hand over the mirror and murmured the traditional phrase dream stare
