the process took only a few seconds
he nodded to saphira
i am done
eragon thanked the men for their assistance and then the two of them left him and saphira alone
while saphira gorged herself eragon sat against the barrel of mead and watched the cooks go about their business
every time they or one of their assistants beheaded a chicken or cut the throat of a pig or a goat or any other animal he transferred the energy from the dying animal into the belt of beloth the wise
it was grim work for most of the animals were still aware when he touched their consciousness and the howling storm of their fear and confusion and pain battered at him until his heart pounded and sweat beaded his brow and he wished nothing more than to heal the suffering creatures
however he knew it was their doom to die lest the varden should starve
he had depleted his reserve of energy during the past few battles and eragon wanted to replenish it before setting out on a long and potentially hazardous journey
if nasuada had allowed him to remain with the varden for another week he could have stocked the diamonds with energy from his own body and still had time to recuperate before running to farthen dur but he could not in the few hours he had
and even if he had done nothing but lie in bed and pour the fire from his limbs into the gems he would not have been able to garner as much force as he did then from the multitude of animals
the diamonds in the belt of beloth the wise seemed to be able to absorb an almost unlimited amount of energy so he stopped when he was unable to bear the prospect of immersing himself in the death throes of another animal
shaking and dripping with sweat from head to toe he leaned forward his hands on his knees and gazed at the ground between his feet struggling not to be ill
memories not his own intruded upon his thoughts memories of saphira soaring over leona lake with him on her back of them plunging into the clear cool water a cloud of white bubbles swarming past them of their shared delight in flying and swimming and playing together
his breathing calmed and he looked at saphira where she sat among the remnants of her kill chewing on the cow is skull
he smiled and sent her his gratitude for her help
we can go now he said
swallowing she replied take my strength as well
you may need it
this is one argument you will not win
i insist
and i insist otherwise
i wo not leave you here weakened and unfit for battle
what if murtagh and thorn attack later today we both need to be ready to fight at any moment
you will be in more danger than i will because galbatorix and the whole of the empire will still believe i am with you
yes but you will be alone with a kull in the middle of the wilderness
i am as accustomed to the wilderness as you
being away from civilization does not frighten me
as for a kull well i do not know if i could beat one at a wrestling match but my wards will protect me from any treachery
i have enough energy saphira
you do not need to give me more
she eyed him considering his words then lifted a paw and started licking it clean of blood
very well i will keep myself
to myself the corners of her mouth seemed to lift with amusement
lowering her paw she said would you be so kind as to roll that barrel over to me with a grunt he got to his feet and did as she asked
she extended a single talon and punched two holes in the top of the barrel which released the sweet smell of apple honey mead
arching her neck so her head was directly above the barrel she grasped it between her massive jaws then lifted it skyward and poured the gurgling contents down her gullet
the empty barrel shattered against the ground when she dropped it and one of the iron hoops rolled several yards away
her upper lip wrinkled saphira shook her head then her breath hitched and she sneezed so hard that her nose struck the ground and a gout of fire erupted from both her mouth and her nostrils
eragon yelped with surprise and jumped sideways batting at the smoking hem of his tunic
the right side of his face felt seared raw by the heat of the fire
