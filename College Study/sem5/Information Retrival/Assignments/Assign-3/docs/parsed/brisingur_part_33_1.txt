eragon stood with his hands on his hips in the middle of the arched corridor outside the chamber and glared at the floor which was tessellated with rectangles of agate and jade
since he and orik had arrived in tronjheim three days ago the thirteen chiefs of the dwarf clans had done nothing but argue about issues that eragon considered inconsequential such as which clans had the right to graze their flocks in certain disputed pastures
as he listened to the clan chiefs debate obscure points of their legal code eragon often felt like shouting that they were being blind fools who were going to doom all of alagaesia to galbatorix is rule unless they put aside their petty concerns and chose a new ruler without further delay
still lost in thought eragon slowly walked down the corridor barely noticing the four guards who followed him as they did wherever he went nor the dwarves he passed in the hall who greeted him with variations of ** the worst one is iorunn eragon decided
the dwarf woman was the grimstborith of durgrimst vrenshrrgn a powerful warlike clan and she had made it clear from the very beginning of the deliberations that she intended to have the throne for herself
only one other clan the urzhad had openly pledged themselves to her cause but as she had demonstrated on multiple occasions during the meetings between the clan chiefs she was clever cunning and able to twist most any situation to her advantage
she might make an excellent queen eragon admitted to himself but she is so devious it is impossible to know whether she would support the varden once she was enthroned
he allowed himself a wry smile
talking with iorunn was always awkward for him
the dwarves considered her a great beauty and even by the standards of humans she cut a striking figure
besides which she seemed to have developed a fascination with eragon that he was unable to fathom
in every conversation they had she insisted upon making allusions to the dwarves history and mythology that eragon did not understand but that seemed to amuse orik and the other dwarves to no end
in addition to iorunn two other clan chiefs had emerged as rivals for the throne gannel chief of durgrimst quan and nado chief of durgrimst knurlcarathn
as the custodians of the dwarves religion the quan wielded enormous influence among their race but so far gannel had obtained the support of but two other clans durgrimst ragni hefthyn and durgrimst ebardac a clan primarily devoted to scholarly research
in contrast nado had forged a larger coalition consisting of the clans feldunost fanghur and az sweldn rak anhuin
whereas iorunn seemed to want the throne merely for the power she would gain thereafter and gannel did not seem inherently hostile to the varden although neither was he friendly toward them nado was openly and vehemently opposed to any involvement with eragon nasuada the empire galbatorix queen islanzadi or so far as eragon could tell any living being outside of the beor mountains
the knurlcarathn were the stoneworkers clan and in men and material goods they had no equal for every other clan depended upon their expertise for the tunneling and the building of their abodes and even the ingeitum needed them to mine the ore for their smiths
and if nado is bid for the crown should falter eragon knew that many of the other lesser clan chiefs who shared his views would leap up to take his place
az sweldn rak anhuin for example whom galbatorix and the forsworn had nearly obliterated during their uprising had declared themselves eragon is blood enemies during his visit to the city of tarnag and in every action of theirs at the clanmeet had demonstrated their implacable hatred of eragon saphira and all things to do with dragons and those who rode them
they had objected to eragon is very presence at the meetings of the clan chiefs even though it was perfectly legal by dwarf law and forced a vote on the issue thereby delaying the proceedings another six unnecessary hours
one of these days thought eragon i will have to find a way to make peace with them
