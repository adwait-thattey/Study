that he was still alive seemed to catch the soldier by surprise for he hesitated before swinging his sword in retaliation
his imprudent delay allowed roran to duck underneath the length of singing steel and seize another spear from the ground with which he slew the soldier
to roran is dismay and disgust the second spear lasted less than a minute before it too shattered in his grip
throwing the splintered remains at the soldiers roran took a shield from a corpse and drew his hammer from his belt
his hammer at least had never failed him
exhaustion proved to be roran is greatest adversary as the last of the soldiers gradually approached each man waiting his turn to duel him
roran is limbs felt heavy and lifeless his vision flickered and he could not seem to get enough air and yet he somehow always managed to summon the energy to defeat his next opponent
as his reflexes slowed the soldiers dealt him numerous cuts and bruises that he could have easily avoided earlier
when gaps appeared between the soldiers and through them roran could see open space he knew his ordeal was nearly at an end
he did not offer the final twelve men mercy nor did they ask it of him even though they could not have hoped to battle their way past him as well as the varden beyond
nor did they attempt to flee
instead they rushed at him snarling cursing desiring only to kill the man who had slain so many of their comrades before they too passed into the void
in a way roran admired their courage
arrows sprouted from the chests of four of the men downing them
a spear thrown from somewhere behind roran took a fifth man under the collarbone and he too toppled onto a bed of corpses
two more spears claimed their victims and then the men reached roran
the lead soldier hewed at roran with a spiked ax
although roran could feel the head of the crossbow bolt grating against his bone he threw up his left arm and blocked the ax with his shield
howling with pain and anger as well as an overwhelming desire for the battle to end roran whipped his hammer around and slew the soldier with a blow to the head
without pause roran hopped forward on his good leg and struck the next soldier twice in the chest before he could defend himself cracking his ribs
the third man parried two of roran is attacks but then roran deceived him with a feint and slew him as well
the final two soldiers converged on roran from either side swinging at his ankles as they climbed to the summit of the piled corpses
his strength flagging roran sparred with them for a long and wearisome while both giving and receiving wounds until at last he killed one man by caving in his helm and the other by breaking his neck with a well placed blow
he felt himself being lifted up and opened his eyes to see harald holding a wineskin to his lips
drink this harald said
you will feel better
his chest heaving roran consumed several draughts between gasps
the sun warmed wine stung the inside of his battered mouth
he felt his legs steady and said it is all right you can let go of me now
roran leaned against his hammer and surveyed the battleground
for the first time he appreciated how high the mound of bodies had grown he and his companions stood at least twenty feet in the air which was nearly level with the tops of the houses on either side
roran saw that most of the soldiers had died of arrows but even so he knew that he had slain a vast number by himself
how
how many he asked harald
the blood spattered warrior shook his head
i lost count after thirty two
perhaps another can say
what you did stronghammer
never have i seen such a feat before not by a man of human abilities
the dragon saphira chose well the men of your family are fighters like no others
your prowess is unmatched by any mortal stronghammer
however many you slew here today i
it was one hundred and ninety ** cried carn clambering toward them from below
are you sure asked roran unbelieving
carn nodded as he reached them
** i watched and i kept careful count
one hundred and ninety three it was ninety four if you count the man you stabbed through the gut before the archers finished him off
