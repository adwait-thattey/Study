although they had managed to partially refill the waterskins during the storm they drank the last of their water that morning
i hope we re going in the right direction said eragon crunching up the empty water bag because we will be in trouble if we do not reach yazuac today
brom did not seem disturbed
i ve traveled this way before
yazuac will be in sight before dusk
eragon laughed doubtfully
perhaps you see something i do not
how can you know that when everything looks exactly the same for leagues around
because i am guided not by the land but by the stars and sun
they will not lead us astray
** let us be off
it is foolish to conjure up woe where none exists
yazuac will be there
his words proved true
saphira spotted the village first but it was not until later in the day that the rest of them saw it as a dark bump on the horizon
yazuac was still very far away it was only visible because of the plain is uniform flatness
as they rode closer a dark winding line appeared on either side of the town and disappeared in the distance
the ninor river said brom pointing at it
eragon pulled cadoc to a stop
saphira will be seen if she stays with us much longer
should she hide while we go into yazuac
brom scratched his chin and looked at the town
see that bend in the river have her wait there
it is far enough from yazuac so no one should find her but close enough that she wo not be left behind
we will go through the town get what we need and then meet her
i do not like it said saphira when eragon had explained the ** is irritating having to hide all the time like a criminal
you know what would happen if we were ** grumbled but gave in and flew away low to the ground
they kept a swift pace in anticipation of the food and drink they would soon enjoy
as they approached the small houses they could see smoke from a dozen chimneys but there was no one in the streets
an abnormal silence enveloped the village
by unspoken consent they stopped before the first house
eragon abruptly said there are not any dogs barking
eragon paused
someone should have seen us by now
then why has not anyone come out
brom squinted at the sun
could be afraid
could be said eragon
he was quiet for a moment
and if it is a trap the ra zac might be waiting for us
** eragon looked around
so we go in
brom flicked his reins
yes but not like fools
this is the main entrance to yazuac
if there is an ambush it will be along here
no one will expect us to arrive from a different direction
around to the side then asked eragon
brom nodded and pulled out his sword resting the bare blade across his saddle
eragon strung his bow and nocked an arrow
they trotted quietly around the town and entered it cautiously
the streets were empty except for a small fox that darted away as they came near
the houses were dark and foreboding with shattered windows
many of the doors swung on broken hinges
the horses rolled their eyes nervously
eragon is palm tingled but he resisted the urge to scratch it
as they rode into the center of town he gripped his bow tighter blanching
gods above he whispered
a mountain of bodies rose above them the corpses stiff and grimacing
their clothes were soaked in blood and the churned ground was stained with it
slaughtered men lay over the women they had tried to protect mothers still clasped their children and lovers who had tried to shield each other rested in death is cold embrace
black arrows stuck out of them all
neither young nor old had been spared
but worst of all was the barbed spear that rose out of the peak of the pile impaling the white body of a baby
tears blurred eragon is vision and he tried to look away but the dead faces held his attention
he stared at their open eyes and wondered how life could have left them so ** does our existence mean when it can end like this a wave of hopelessness overwhelmed him
a crow dipped out of the sky like a black shadow and perched on the spear
it cocked its head and greedily scrutinized the infant is corpse
oh no you do not snarled eragon as he pulled back the bowstring and released it with a twang
