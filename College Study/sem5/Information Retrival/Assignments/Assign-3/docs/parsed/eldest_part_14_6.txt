they eschewed frippery except for small intricate brooches of iron and stone
at the feldunost is piercing footsteps the dwarves turned to look at the new arrivals
they did not cheer as eragon had expected but rather bowed and murmured ** as they saw the hammer and stars upon eragon is helm admiration was replaced by shock and in many cases outrage
a number of the angrier dwarves contracted around the feldunost glaring between the animals at eragon and shouting imprecations
the back of eragon is neck ** seems that adopting me was not the most popular decision hrothgar could make
aye agreed ** may have strengthened his hold on you but at the cost of alienating many of the dwarves
we d better get out of sight before blood is shed
thorv and the other guards rode forward as if the crowd was nonexistent clearing the way through seven additional tiers until only a single gate separated them from the mass of celbedeil
then thorv turned left toward a great hall pressed against the side of the mountain and protected in fore by a barbican with two machicolated towers
as they neared the hall a group of armed dwarves streamed out from between the houses and formed a thick line blocking the street
long purple veils covered their faces and draped over their shoulders like mail coifs
the guards immediately reined in their feldunost faces hard
what is it eragon asked orik but the dwarf only shook his head and strode forward a hand on his ax
etzil ** cried a veiled dwarf raising a fist
formv hrethcarach
formv jurgencarmeitder nos eta goroth bahst tarnag dur encesti rak ** jok is warrev az barzulegur dur durgrimst az sweldn rak anhuin mogh tor rak jurgenvren ne udim etal os rast knurlag
knurlag ana
for a long minute he continued to rant with growing spleen
** barked thorv cutting him off then the two dwarves began arguing
despite the harsh exchange eragon saw that thorv seemed to respect the other dwarf
eragon shifted to the side trying to get a better view past thorv is feldunost and the veiled dwarf abruptly fell silent jabbing at eragon is helm with an expression of horror
knurlag qana qiranu durgrimst ** he screamed
qarzul ana hrothgar oen volfild
jok is frekk durgrimstvren interrupted orik quietly drawing his ax
worried eragon glanced at arya but she was too intent on the confrontation to notice him
he surreptitiously slid his hand down and around zar roc is wire wrapped hilt
the strange dwarf stared hard at orik then removed an iron ring from his pocket plucked three hairs from his beard twined them around the ring and threw it onto the street with an impervious clink spitting after it
without a word the purple shrouded dwarves filed away
thorv orik and the other warriors flinched as the ring bounced across the granite pavement
even arya seemed taken aback
two of the younger dwarves blanched and reached for their blades then dropped their hands as thorv barked **
their reactions unsettled eragon far more than the raucous exchange had
as orik strode forward alone and deposited the ring in a pouch eragon asked what does it mean
it means said thorv that you have enemies
they hurried through the barbican to a wide courtyard arrayed with three banquet tables decorated with lanterns and banners
before the tables stood a group of dwarves foremost among them a gray bearded dwarf swathed in wolfskin
he spread his arms saying welcome to tarnag home of durgrimst ragni hefthyn
we have heard much praise of you eragon shadeslayer
i am undin son of derund and clan chief
another dwarf stepped forward
he had the shoulders and chest of a warrior topped with hooded black eyes that never left eragon is face
and i gannel son of orm blood ax and clan chief of durgrimst quan
it is an honor to be your guests said eragon inclining his head
he felt saphira is irritation at being ** he murmured forcing a smile
the clan chiefs greeted arya and orik in turn but their hospitality was lost on orik whose only response was to extend his hand the iron ring on his palm
undin is eyes widened and he gingerly lifted the ring pinching it between his thumb and forefinger as if it were a venomous snake
