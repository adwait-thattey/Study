as jormundur hurried off narheim urged his pony closer to nasuada
what of mine own people nasuada what role shall we play
nasuada frowned at the thick choking dust that drifted across the rolling expanse of grass
you can help guard our perimeter
if the soldiers should somehow win free of she was forced to pause as four hundred urgals more had arrived since the battle of the burning plains pounded out of the center of the camp through the gate and onto the field beyond roaring incomprehensible warcries the whole while
as they vanished into the dust nasuada resumed speaking if the soldiers should win free your axes will be most welcome in the lines
the wind gusted toward them carrying with it the screams of dying men and horses the shivery sound of metal sliding over metal the clink of swords glancing off helmets the dull impact of spears on shields and underlying it all a horrible humorless laughter that issued from a multitude of throats and continued without pause throughout the mayhem
it was eragon thought the laughter of the insane
narheim pounded his fist against his hip
by morgothal we are not ones to stand by idly when there is a fight to be ** release us nasuada and let us hew a few necks for **
** exclaimed nasuada
no no and ** i have given you my orders and i expect you to abide by them
this is a battle of horses and men and urgals and perhaps even dragons
it is not a fit place for dwarves
you would be trampled like ** at narheim is outraged oath she raised a hand
i am well aware you are fearsome warriors
no one knows that better than i who fought beside you in farthen dur
however not to put too fine a point on it you are short by our standards and i would rather not risk your warriors in a fray such as this where your stature might be your undoing
better to wait here on the high ground where you stand taller than anyone who tries to climb this berm and let the soldiers come to you
if any soldiers do reach us they shall be warriors of such tremendous skill i want you and your people there to repel them for one might as well try to uproot a mountain as defeat a dwarf
still displeased narheim grumbled some response but whatever he said was lost as the varden nasuada had deployed filed through the cleft in the embankment where the gate had been
the noise of tramping feet and clattering equipment faded as the men drew away from the camp
then the wind stiffened into a steady breeze and from the direction of the fighting the grim giggle again wafted toward them
a moment later a mental shout of incredible strength overwhelmed eragon is defenses and tore through his consciousness filling him with agony as he heard a man say ah no help ** they wo not ** angvard take them they wo not ** the link between their minds vanished then and eragon swallowed hard as he realized that the man had been killed
nasuada shifted in her saddle her expression strained
who was that
it seems we all did said arya
i think it was barden one of the spellcasters who rides with king orrin but
thorn had been circling higher and higher while king orrin and his men engaged the soldiers but now the dragon hung motionless in the sky halfway between the soldiers and the camp and murtagh is voice augmented with magic echoed forth across the land ** i see you there hiding behind nasuada is skirts
come fight me ** it is your destiny
or are you a coward shadeslayer
saphira answered for eragon by lifting her head and roaring even louder than murtagh is thunderous speech then discharging a twenty foot long jet of crackling blue fire
the horses close to saphira including nasuada is bolted away leaving saphira and eragon alone on the embankment with the elves
walking over to saphira arya placed a hand on eragon is left leg and looked up at him with her slanted green eyes
accept this from me shur tugal she said
and he felt a surge of energy flow into him
eka elrun ono he murmured to her
also in the ancient language she said be careful eragon
i would not want to see you broken by murtagh
i
it seemed as if she were going to say more but she hesitated then removed her hand from his leg and retreated to stand by blodhgarm
