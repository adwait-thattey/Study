however our enemy is the most dangerous foe we or this land has ever faced
as much as i dislike acknowledging it glaedr and i are at a disadvantage and it is quite possible that we shall not survive the battles yet to come
we have lived long and full lives and the sorrows of centuries press upon us but the two of you are young and fresh and full of hope and i believe your prospects of defeating galbatorix are greater than those of anyone else
oromis glanced at glaedr and the elf is face became troubled
therefore in order to help ensure your survival and as a precaution against our possible demise glaedr has with my blessing decided to
i have decided said glaedr to give you my heart of hearts saphira brightscales eragon shadeslayer
saphira is astonishment was no less than eragon is
together they stared at the majestic gold dragon who towered high above them
saphira said master you honor us beyond words but
are you sure that you wish to entrust your heart to us
i am sure said glaedr and lowered his massive head until it was only slightly above eragon
for many reasons i am sure
if you hold my heart you shall be able to communicate with oromis and me no matter how far apart we may be and i shall be able to aid you with my strength whenever you are in difficulty
and if oromis and i should fall in battle our knowledge and experience and also my strength shall still be at your disposal
long have i pondered this choice and i am confident it is the right one
but if oromis were to die said eragon in a soft voice would you really want to live on without him and as an eldunari
glaedr turned his head and focused one of his immense eyes upon eragon
i do not wish to be parted from oromis but whatever happens i shall continue to do what i can to topple galbatorix from his throne
that is our only goal and not even death shall deter us from pursuing it
the idea of losing saphira horrifies you eragon and rightly so
however oromis and i have had centuries to reconcile ourselves with the fact that such a parting is inevitable
no matter how careful we are if we live long enough eventually one of us will die
it is not a happy thought but it is the truth
such is the way of the world
shifting his stance oromis said i cannot pretend that i regard this with favor but the purpose of life is not to do what we want but what needs to be done
this is what fate demands of us
so now i ask you said glaedr saphira brightscales and eragon shadeslayer will you accept my gift and all that it entails
i will replied eragon after a brief hesitation
then glaedr drew back his head
the muscles of his abdomen rippled and clenched several times and his throat began to convulse as if something were stuck in it
widening his stance the gold dragon extended his neck straight out in front of him every cord and sinew of his body standing in high relief underneath the armor of his sparkling scales
glaedr is throat continued to flex and relax with increasing speed until at last he lowered his head so that it was level with eragon and opened his jaws hot pungent air pouring from his massive maw
eragon squinted and tried not to gag
as he gazed into the depths of glaedr is mouth eragon saw the dragon is throat contract one last time and then a hint of gold light appeared between the folds of dripping blood red tissue
a second later a round object about a foot in diameter slid down glaedr is crimson tongue and out of his mouth so fast eragon nearly missed catching it
as his hands closed around the slippery saliva covered eldunari eragon gasped and staggered backward for he suddenly felt glaedr is every thought and emotion and all of the sensations of his body
the amount of information was overwhelming as was the closeness of their contact
eragon had expected as much but it still shocked him to realize he was holding glaedr is entire being between his hands
glaedr flinched shaking his head as if he had been stung and quickly shielded his mind from eragon although eragon could still sense the flicker of his shifting thoughts as well as the general color of his emotions
