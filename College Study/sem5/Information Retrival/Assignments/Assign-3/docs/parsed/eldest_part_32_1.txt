the morning after his speech roran looked out his window and saw twelve men leaving carvahall heading toward igualda falls
he yawned and limped downstairs to the kitchen
horst sat alone at the table twisting a mug of ale in his hands
morning he said
roran grunted tore a heel of bread off the loaf on the counter then seated himself at the opposite end of the table
as he ate he noted horst is bloodshot eyes and unkempt beard
roran guessed that the smith had been awake the entire night
do you know why a group is going up
have to talk with their families said horst abruptly
they ve been running into the spine since ** he put the mug down with acrack
you have no idea what you did roran by asking us to leave
the whole village is in turmoil
you backed us into a corner with only one way out your way
some people hate you for it
of course a fair number of them already hated you for bringing this upon us
the bread in roran is mouth tasted like sawdust as resentment flared inside ** was the one who brought back the stone not me
and the others
horst sipped his ale and grimaced
the others adore you
i never thought i would see the day when garrow is son would stir my heart with words but you did it boy you did ** he swung a gnarled hand over his head
all this i built it for elain and my sons
it took me seven years to ** see that beam over the door right there i broke three toes getting that into place
and you know what i am going to give it up because of what you said last night
roran remained silent it was what he wanted
leaving carvahall was the right thing to do and since he had committed himself to that course he saw no reason to torment himself with guilt and ** decision is made
i will accept the outcome without complaint no matter how dire for this is our only escape from the empire
but said horst and leaned forward on one elbow his black eyes burning beneath his brow just you remember that if reality falls short of the airy dreams you conjured there will be debts to pay
give people a hope and then take it away and they will destroy you
the prospect was of no concern to ** we make it to surda we will be greeted as heroes by the rebels
if we do not our deaths will fulfill all debts
when it was clear that the smith had finished roran asked where is elain
horst scowled at the change of topic
out ** he stood and straightened his tunic over his heavy shoulders
i have to go clear out the smithy and decide what tools i am going to take
i will hide or destroy the rest
the empire wo not benefit frommy work
i will ** roran pushed back his chair
no said horst roughly
this is a task i can only do with albriech and baldor
that forge has been my entire life and theirs
you would not be much help with that arm of yours anyway
stay here
elain can use you
after the smith left roran opened the side door and found elain talking with gertrude by the large pile of firewood horst maintained year round
the healer went up to roran and put a hand on his forehead
ah i was afraid that you might have a fever after yesterday is excitement
your family heals at the most extraordinary rate
i could barely believe my eyes when eragon started walking about after having his legs skinned and spending two days in ** roran stiffened at the mention of his cousin but she did not seem to notice
let is see how your shoulder is doing shall we
roran bowed his neck so that gertrude could reach behind him and untie the knot to the wool sling
when it was undone he carefully lowered his right forearm which was immobilized in a splint until his arm was straight
gertrude slid her fingers under the poultice packed on his wound and peeled it off
a thick rancid smell clogged the air
roran clenched his teeth as his gorge rose then looked down
the skin under the poultice had turned white and spongy like a giant birthmark of maggot flesh
the bite itself had been stitched up while he was unconscious so all he saw was a jagged pink line caked with blood on the front of his shoulder
swelling and inflammation had forced the twisted catgut threads to cut deep into his flesh while beads of clear liquid oozed from the wound
