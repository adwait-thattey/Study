notelda corrected oromis
you may call me master in this tongue and ebrithil in the ancient language nothing else
you will extend the same courtesy to glaedr
we are your teachers you are our students and you will act with proper respect and ** oromis spoke gently but with the authority of one who expects absolute obedience
eragon could sense how hard it was for saphira to unbend her pride enough to say yes master
oromis nodded
now
anyone with such a collection of scars has either been hopelessly unfortunate fights like a berserker or deliberately pursues danger
do you fight like a berserker
nor do you seem unfortunate quite the opposite
that leaves only one explanation
unless you think differently
eragon cast his mind over his experiences at home and on the road in an attempt to categorize his behavior
i would say rather that once i dedicate myself to a certain project or path i see it through no matter the cost
especially if someone i love is in ** his gaze flicked toward saphira
and do you undertake challenging projects
so you feel the need to pit yourself against adversity in order to test your abilities
i enjoy overcoming challenges but i ve faced enough hardship to know that it is foolish to make things more difficult than they are
it is all i can do to survive as it is
yet you chose to follow the ra zac when it would have been easier to remain in palancar valley
and you came here
it was the right thing to do
master
for several minutes no one spoke
eragon tried to guess what the elf was thinking but could glean no information from his masklike visage
finally oromis stirred
were you perchance given a trinket of some kind in tarnag eragon a piece of jewelry armor or even a coin
** eragon reached inside of his tunic and fished out the necklace with the tiny silver hammer
gannel made this for me on hrothgar is orders to prevent anyone from scrying saphira or me
they were afraid that galbatorix might have discovered what i look like
how did you know
because said oromis i could no longer sense you
someone tried to scry me by silthrim about a week ago
was that you
oromis shook his head
after i first scryed you with arya i had no need to use such crude methods to find you
i could reach out and touch your mind with mine as i did when you were injured in farthen ** lifting the amulet he murmured several lines in the ancient language then released it
it contains no other spells i can detect
keep it with you at all times it is a valuable ** he pressed the tips of his long fingers together his nails as round and bright as fish scales and stared between the arches they formed toward the white horizon
why are you here eragon
and what do you think that process entails
eragon shifted uncomfortably
learning more about magic and fighting
brom was not able to finish teaching me everything that he knew
magic swordsmanship and other such skills are useless unless you know how and when to apply them
this i will teach you
however as galbatorix has demonstrated power without moral direction is the most dangerous force in the world
my main task then is to help you eragon and saphira to understand what principles guide you so that you do not make the right choices for the wrong reasons
you must learn more about yourself who you are and what you are capable of doing
that is why you are here
oromis began to answer when he stiffened and dropped his flagon
his face went crimson and his fingers tightened into hooked claws that dragged at his robe like cockleburs
the change was frightening and instantaneous
before eragon could do more than flinch the elf had relaxed again although his entire body now bespoke weariness
concerned eragon dared to ask are you well
a trace of amusement lifted the corner of oromis is mouth
less so than i might wish
we elves fancy ourselves immortal but not even we can escape certain maladies of the flesh which are beyond our knowledge of magic to do more than delay
no do not worry
it is not contagious but neither can i rid myself of ** he sighed
i have spent decades binding myself with hundreds of small weak spells that layered one upon another duplicate the effect of enchantments that are now beyond my reach
