by the time there was only one square left the dragon is belly was bulging
he proffered the last piece the dragon considered it for a moment then lazily snapped it up
done eating it crawled onto his arm and curled against his chest
then it snorted a puff of dark smoke rising from its nostrils
eragon looked at it with wonder
just when he thought the dragon was asleep a low humming came from its vibrating throat
gently he carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow
the dragon eyes closed wrapped its tail around the bedpost contentedly
eragon lay next to it flexing his hand in the near darkness
he faced a painful dilemma by raising a dragon he could become a rider
myths and stories about riders were treasured and being one would automatically place him among those legends
however if the empire discovered the dragon he and his family would be put to death unless he joined the king
no one could or would help them
the simplest solution was just to kill the dragon but the idea was repugnant and he rejected it
dragons were too revered for him to even consider ** what could betray us he ** live in a remote area and have done nothing to draw attention
the problem was convincing garrow and roran to let him keep the dragon
neither of them would care to have a dragon ** could raise it in secret
in a month or two it will be too large for garrow to get rid of but will he accept it even if he does can i get enough food for the dragon while it is hiding it is no larger than a small cat but it ate an entire handful of ** i suppose it will be able to hunt for itself eventually but how long until then will it be able to survive the cold outside all the same he wanted the dragon
the more he thought about it the surer he was
however things might work out with garrow eragon would do everything he could to protect it
determined he fell asleep with the dragon cradled against him
when dawn came the dragon was sitting atop his bedpost like an ancient sentinel welcoming the new day
eragon marveled at its color
he had never seen such a clear hard blue
its scales were like hundreds of small gemstones
he noticed that the white oval on his palm where he had touched the dragon had a silvery sheen
he hoped he could hide it by keeping his hands dirty
the dragon launched off the post and glided to the floor
eragon gingerly picked it up and left the quiet house pausing to grab meat several leather strips and as many rags as he could carry
the crisp morning was beautiful a fresh layer of snow covered the farm
he smiled as the small creature looked around with interest from the safety of his arms
hurrying across the fields he walked silently into the dark forest searching for a safe place for the dragon to stay
eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a barren knoll its branches snow tipped gray fingers that reached toward the sky
he set the dragon down by the base of the trunk and shook the leather onto the ground
with a few deft movements he made a noose and slipped it over the dragon is head as it explored the snowy clumps surrounding the tree
the leather was worn but it would hold
he watched the dragon crawl around then untied the noose from its neck and fashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the dragon would not strangle itself
next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the branches layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat
snow fell on his face as the tree swayed
he hung more rags over the front of the shelter to keep heat inside
pleased he surveyed his work
time to show you your new home he said and lifted the dragon up into the branches
it wriggled trying to get free then clambered into the hut where it ate a piece of meat curled up and blinked coyly at him
you will be fine as long as you stay in here he instructed
the dragon blinked again
sure that it had not understood him eragon groped with his mind until he felt the dragon is consciousness
again he had the terrible feeling ofopenness of a space so large it pressed down on him like a heavy blanket
