you are not very smart for a dragon rider
i did warn you
you said ** eragon
the cat yawned then stretched and sauntered across the floor weaving its way between objects
but you re just a ** objected
the cat yowled and stalked back to him
it jumped on his chest and crouched there looking down at him with gleaming eyes
eragon tried to sit up but it growled showing its ** i look like other cats
then what makes you think i am one eragon started to say something but the creature dug its claws into his ** your education has been neglected
i to correct your mistake am a werecat
there are not many of us left but i think even a farm boy should have heard of us
i did not know you were real said eragon fascinated
a ** he was indeed fortunate
they were always flitting around the edges of stories keeping to themselves and occasionally giving advice
if the legends were true they had magical powers lived longer than humans and usually knew more than they told
the werecat blinked ** is independent of being
i did not know you existed before you bumbled in here and ruined my nap
yet that does not mean you were not real before you woke me
eragon was lost by its ** am sorry i disturbed you
i was getting up anyway it said
it leapt back onto the counter and licked its ** i were you i would not hold on to that rod much longer
it is going to shock you again in a few seconds
he hastily put the rod back where he had found ** is it
a common and boring artifact unlike myself
did not you find out the werecat finished cleaning its paw stretched once more then jumped back up to its sleeping place
it sat down tucked its paws under its breast and closed its eyes purring
one of the werecat is slanted eyes cracked ** go by many names
if you are looking for my proper one you will have to seek elsewhere
the eye closed
eragon gave up and turned to ** you may call me solembum
thank you said eragon seriously
solembum is purring grew louder
the door to the shop swung open letting in a beam of sunlight
angela entered with a cloth bag full of plants
her eyes flickered at solembum and she looked startled
he says you talked with him
you can talk with him too asked eragon
she tossed her head
of course but that does not mean he will say anything ** she set her plants on the counter then walked behind it and faced him
he likes you
that is unusual
most of the time solembum does not show himself to customers
in fact he says that you show some promise given a few years of work
it is a compliment coming from him
you re only the third person to come in here who has been able to speak with him
the first was a woman many years ago the second was a blind beggar and now you
but i do not run a store just so i can prattle on
is there anything you want or did you only come in to look
just to look said eragon still thinking about the werecat
besides i do not really need any herbs
that is not all i do said angela with a grin
the rich fool lords pay me for love potions and the like
i never claim that they work but for some reason they keep coming back
but i do not think you need those chicaneries
would you like your fortune told i do that too for all the rich fool ladies
eragon laughed
no i am afraid my fortune is pretty much unreadable
and i do not have any money
angela looked at solembum curiously
i think
she gestured at the crystal ball resting on the counter
that is only for show anyway it does not do anything
but i do have
wait here i will be right ** she hurried into a room at the back of the shop
she came back breathless holding a leather pouch which she set on the counter
i have not used these for so long i almost forgot where they were
now sit across from me and i will show you why i went to all this ** eragon found a stool and sat
solembum is eyes glowed from the gap in the drawers
angela laid a thick cloth on the counter then poured a handful of smooth bones each slightly longer than a finger onto it
runes and symbols were inscribed along their sides
these she said touching them gently are the knucklebones of a dragon
do not ask where i got them it is a secret i wo not reveal
