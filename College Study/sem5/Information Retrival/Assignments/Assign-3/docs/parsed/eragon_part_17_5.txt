he picked through the rest of the house for other useful items and dumped the collection next to brom
it was a meager pile
what now asked brom
his eyes were sharp and inquisitive
eragon looked away
we find a place to hide
do you have somewhere in mind
** he wrapped all the supplies except for his bow into a tight bundle and tied it shut
hefting it onto his back he said this way and headed into the ** follow us in the air
your footprints are too easily found and tracked
very ** took off behind them
their destination was nearby but eragon took a circuitous route in an effort to baffle any pursuers
it was well over an hour before he finally stopped in a well concealed bramble
the irregular clearing in the center was just large enough for a fire two people and a dragon
red squirrels scampered into the trees chattering in protest at their intrusion
brom extricated himself from a vine and looked around with interest
does anyone else know of this he asked
no
i found it when we first moved here
it took me a week to dig into the center and another week to clear out all the ** saphira landed beside them and folded her wings careful to avoid the thorns
she curled up snapping twigs with her hard scales and rested her head on the ground
her unreadable eyes followed them closely
brom leaned against his staff and fixed his gaze on her
his scrutiny made eragon nervous
eragon watched them until hunger forced him to action
he built a fire filled a pot with snow and then set it over the flames to melt
when the water was hot he tore off chunks of meat and dropped them into the pot with a lump of ** much of a meal he thought grimly but it will do
i will probably be eating this for some time to come so i might as well get used to it
the stew simmered quietly spreading a rich aroma through the clearing
the tip of saphira is tongue snaked out and tasted the air
when the meat was tender brom came over and eragon served the food
they ate silently avoiding each other is eyes
afterward brom pulled out his pipe and lit it leisurely
why do you want to travel with me asked eragon
a cloud of smoke left brom is lips and spiraled up through the trees until it disappeared
i have a vested interest in keeping you alive he said
what do you mean demanded eragon
to put it bluntly i am a storyteller and i happen to think that you will make a fine story
you re the first rider to exist outside of the king is control for over a hundred years
what will happen will you perish as a martyr will you join the varden or will you kill king galbatorix all fascinating questions
and i will be there to see every bit of it no matter what i have to do
a knot formed in eragon is stomach
he could not see himself doing any of those things least of all becoming a ** want my vengeance but for the rest
i have no ambition
that may be but tell me how can you talk with saphira
brom took his time putting more tobacco in his pipe
once it was relit and firmly in his mouth he said very well if it is answers you want it is answers you will get but they may not be to your ** he got up brought his pack over to the fire and pulled out a long object wrapped in cloth
it was about five feet long and from the way he handled it rather heavy
he peeled away the cloth strip by strip like a mummy being unswathed
eragon gazed transfixed as a sword was revealed
the gold pommel was teardrop shaped with the sides cut away to reveal a ruby the size of a small egg
the hilt was wrapped in silver wire burnished until it gleamed like starlight
the sheath was wine red and smooth as glass adorned solely by a strange black symbol etched into it
next to the sword was a leather belt with a heavy buckle
the last strip fell away and brom passed the weapon to eragon
the handle fit eragon is hand as if it had been made for him
he slowly drew the sword it slid soundlessly from the sheath
the flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in the firelight
the keen edges curved gracefully to a sharp point
a duplicate of the black symbol was inscribed on the metal
the balance of the sword was perfect it felt like an extension of his arm unlike the rude farm tools he was used to
