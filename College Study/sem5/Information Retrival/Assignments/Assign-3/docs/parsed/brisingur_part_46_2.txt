roran froze with one foot in a stirrup and silently swore to himself
he had hoped that just such a situation would not arise during the trip
swinging around he said no are you refusing to obey my orders
drawing back his lips to expose his short fangs yarbog said no
i challenge you for leadership of this tribe ** and the urgal threw back his massive head and bellowed so loudly that the rest of the humans and urgals stopped what they were doing and ran toward the willow tree until all forty of them were clustered around yarbog and roran
shall we attend to this creature for you carn asked his voice ringing out
wishing that there were not so many onlookers roran shook his head
no i shall deal with him ** despite his words he was glad to have his men beside him opposite the line of hulking gray skinned urgals
the humans were smaller than the urgals but all except roran were mounted on horses which would give them a slight advantage if there were a fight between the two groups
if that came to pass carn is magic would be of little help for the urgals had a spellcaster of their own a shaman named dazhgra and from what roran had seen dazhgra was the more powerful magician if not as skilled in the nuances of their arcane art
to yarbog roran said it is not the custom of the varden to award leadership based upon trial by combat
if you wish to fight i will fight but you will gain nothing by it
if i lose carn will assume my command and you will answer to him instead of me
** said yarbog
i do not challenge you for the right to lead your own race
i challenge you for the right to lead us the fighting rams of the bolvek ** you have not proven yourself stronghammer so you cannot claim the position of chieftain
if you lose i will become chieftain here and we shall not lift our chins to you carn or any other creature too weak to earn our **
roran pondered his situation before accepting the inevitable
even if it cost him his life he had to try to maintain his authority over the urgals else the varden would lose them as allies
taking a breath he said among my race it is customary for the person who has been challenged to choose the time and place for the fight as well as the weapons both parties will use
chortling deep in his throat yarbog said the time is now stronghammer
the place is here
and among my race we fight in a loincloth and without weapons
that is hardly fair since i have no horns roran pointed out
will you agree to let me use my hammer to compensate for my lack
yarbog thought about it then said you may keep your helmet and shield but no hammer
weapons are not allowed when we fight to be chief
i see
well if i can not have my hammer i will forgo my helmet and shield as well
what are the rules of combat and how shall we decide the winner
there is only one rule stronghammer if you flee you forfeit the match and are banished from your tribe
you win by forcing your rival to submit but since i will never submit we will fight to the death
roran nodded
that might be what he intends to do but i wo not kill him if i can help it
let us begin he cried and banged his hammer against his shield
at his direction the men and urgals cleared a space in the middle of the ravine and pegged out a square twelve paces by twelve paces
then roran and yarbog stripped and two urgals slathered bear grease over yarbog is body while carn and loften another human did the same for roran
rub as much as you can into my back roran murmured
he wanted his scabs to be as soft as possible so as to minimize the number of places they would crack
leaning close to him carn said why did you refuse the shield and helmet
they would only slow me
i will have to be as fast as a frightened hare if i am to avoid being crushed by ** as carn and loften worked their way down his limbs roran studied his opponent searching for any vulnerability that would help him defeat the urgal
yarbog stood well over six feet tall
his back was broad his chest deep and his arms and legs covered with knotted muscles
his neck was as thick as a bull is as it had to be in order to sustain the weight of his head and his curled horns
