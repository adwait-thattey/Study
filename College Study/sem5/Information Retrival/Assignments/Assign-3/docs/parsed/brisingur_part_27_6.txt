when nasuada spoke she said what exactly do you hope to gain from such a visit
i do not ** growled eragon
he struck the pommel of the falchion with his fist
and that is the heart of the problem we do not know enough
it might accomplish nothing but on the other hand we might learn something that could help us vanquish murtagh and galbatorix once and for all
we barely won yesterday nasuada
** and i fear that when we again face thorn and murtagh murtagh will be even stronger than before and frost coats my bones when i consider the fact that galbatorix is abilities far exceed murtagh is despite the vast amount of power he has already bestowed upon my brother
the elf who taught me he
eragon hesitated considering the wisdom of what he was about to say then forged onward he hinted that he knows how it is galbatorix is strength has been increasing every year but he refused to reveal more at the time because we were not advanced enough in our training
now after our encounters with thorn and murtagh i think he will share his knowledge with us
moreover there are entire branches of magic we have yet to explore and any one of them might provide the means to defeat galbatorix
if we are going to gamble upon this trip nasuada then let us not gamble to maintain our current position let us gamble to increase our standing and so win this game of chance
nasuada sat motionless for over a minute
i cannot make this decision until after the dwarves hold their coronation
whether you go to du weldenvarden will depend on the movements of the empire then and on what our spies report about murtagh and thorn is activities
over the course of the next two hours nasuada instructed eragon about the thirteen dwarf clans
she schooled him in their history and their politics in the products upon which each clan based the majority of its trade in the names families and personalities of the clan chiefs in the list of important tunnels excavated and controlled by each clan and in what she felt would be the best way to coax the dwarves to elect a king or queen friendly to the goals of the varden
ideally orik would be the one to take the throne she said
king hrothgar was highly regarded by most of his subjects and durgrimst ingeitum remains one of the richest and most influential of clans all of which is to orik is benefit
orik is devoted to our cause
he has served as one of the varden you and i both count him as a friend and he is your foster brother
i believe he has the skills to become an excellent king for the ** amusement kindled in her expression
small matter that
however he is young by the standards of the dwarves and his association with us may prove to be an insurmountable barrier for the other clan chiefs
another obstacle is that the other great clans durgrimst feldunost and durgrimst knurlcarathn to name but two are eager after over a hundred years of rule by the ingeitum to see the crown go to a different clan
by all means support orik if it can help him onto the throne but if it becomes obvious that his attempt is doomed and your backing could guarantee the success of another clan chief who favors the varden then transfer your support even if doing so will offend orik
you cannot allow friendship to interfere with politics not now
when nasuada finished her lecture on the dwarf clans she eragon and saphira spent several minutes figuring out how eragon could slip out of the camp without being noticed
after they had finally hammered out the details of the plan eragon and saphira returned to their tent and told blodhgarm what they had decided
to eragon is surprise the fur covered elf did not object
curious eragon asked do you approve
it is not my place to say whether i approve or not blodhgarm replied his voice a low purr
but since nasuada is stratagem does not seem to put either of you in unreasonable danger and by means of this you may have the opportunity to further your learning in ellesmera neither i nor my brethren shall ** he inclined his head
if you will excuse me bjartskular ** skirting saphira the elf exited the tent allowing a bright flash of light to pierce the darkness inside as he pushed aside the entrance flap
