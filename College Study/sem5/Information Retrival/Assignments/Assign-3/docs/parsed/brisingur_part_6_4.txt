from there katrina clambered the looped leg straps of the saddle as if a ladder until she sat perched upon the crest of saphira is shoulders
like a mountain goat leaping from one ledge to another roran duplicated her ascent
crossing the cave after them eragon examined saphira assessing the severity of her various scrapes gashes tears bruises and stab wounds
to do so he relied upon what she herself felt in addition to what he could see
for goodness sake said saphira save your attentions until we are well out of danger
i am not going to bleed to death
that is not quite true and you know it
you re bleeding inside
unless i stop it now you may suffer complications i can not heal and then we will never get back to the varden
do not argue you can not change my mind and i wo not take a minute
as it turned out eragon required several minutes to restore saphira to her former health
her injuries were severe enough that in order to complete his spells he had to empty the belt of beloth the wise of energy and after that draw upon saphira is own vast reserves of strength
whenever he shifted from a larger wound to a smaller one she protested that he was being foolish and would he please leave off but he ignored her complaints much to her growing displeasure
afterward eragon slumped tired from the magic and the fighting
flicking a finger toward the places where the lethrblaka had skewered her with their beaks he said you should have arya or another elf inspect my handiwork on those
i did my best but i may have missed something
i appreciate your concern for my welfare she replied but this is hardly the place for softhearted demonstrations
once and for all let us be gone
aye
time to leave
stepping back eragon edged away from saphira in the direction of the tunnel behind him
come ** called roran
hurry **
eragon shook his head
no
i am staying here
you roran started to say but a ferocious growl from saphira interrupted him
she lashed her tail against the side of the cave and raked the floor with her talons so that bone and stone squealed in what sounded like mortal agony
** shouted eragon
one of the ra zac is still on the loose
and think what else might be in helgrind scrolls potions information about the empire is activities things that can help ** the ra zac may even have eggs of theirs stored here
if they do i have to destroy them before galbatorix can claim them for his own
to saphira eragon also said i can not kill sloan i can not let roran or katrina see him and i can not allow him to starve to death in his cell or galbatorix is men to recapture him
i am sorry but i have to deal with sloan on my own
how will you get out of the empire demanded roran
i will run
i am as fast as an elf now you know
the tip of saphira is tail twitched
that was the only warning eragon had before she leaped toward him extending one of her glittering paws
he fled dashing into the tunnel a fraction of a second before saphira is foot passed through the space where he had been
saphira skidded to a stop in front of the tunnel and roared with frustration that she was unable to follow him into the narrow enclosure
her bulk blocked most of the light
the stone shook around eragon as she tore at the entrance with her claws and teeth breaking off thick chunks
her feral snarls and the sight of her lunging muzzle filled with teeth as long as his forearm sent a jolt of fear through eragon
he understood then how a rabbit must feel when it cowers in its den while a wolf digs after it
** saphira placed her head on the ground and uttered a mournful keen her eyes large and pitiful
** i love you saphira but you have to go
she retreated several yards from the tunnel and snuffled at him mewling like a cat
little one
eragon hated to make her unhappy and he hated to send her away it felt as if he were tearing himself apart
saphira is misery flowed across their mental link and coupled with his own anguish almost paralyzed him
somehow he mustered the nerve to say ** and do not come back for me or send anyone else for me
i will be fine
** **
saphira howled with frustration and then reluctantly walked to the mouth of the cave
