a branch cracked as saphira approached from behind
she crouched by his side her scales painting him with hundreds of shifting flecks of blue light and stared in the same direction as he
are you angry with me she asked
no of course not
i understand that you could not break your oath in the ancient language
i just wish that brom could have told me this himself and that he had not felt it necessary to hide the truth from me
she swung her head toward him
and how do you feel eragon
you know as well as i
a few minutes ago i did but not now
you have grown still and looking into your mind is like peering into a lake so deep i cannot see the bottom
what is in you little one is it rage is it happiness or have you no emotions to give
what is in me is acceptance he said and turned to face her
i cannot change who my parents are i reconciled myself with that after the burning plains
what is is and no amount of gnashing teeth on my part will change that
i am
glad i think to consider brom my father
but i am not sure
it is too much to grasp all at once
perhaps what i have to give you will help
would you like to see the memory brom left for you or would you prefer to wait
no no waiting he said
if we delay you may never have the opportunity
then close your eyes and let me show you what once was
eragon did as she directed and from saphira there flowed a stream of sensations sights sounds smells and more everything that she had been experiencing at the time of the memory
before him eragon beheld a glade in the forest somewhere among the foothills piled against the western side of the spine
the grass was thick and lush and veils of chartreuse lichen hung from the tall drooping moss covered trees
due to the rains that swept inland from the ocean the woods were far greener and wetter than those of palancar valley
as seen through saphira is eyes the greens and reds were more subdued than they would have been to eragon while every hue of blue shone with additional intensity
the smell of moist soil and punky wood suffused the air
and in the center of the glade lay a fallen tree and upon the fallen tree sat brom
the hood of the old man is robe was pulled back to expose his bare head
across his lap lay his sword
his twisted rune carved staff stood propped against the log
the ring aren glittered on his right hand
for a long while brom did not move and then he squinted up at the sky his hooked nose casting a long shadow across his face
his voice rasped and eragon swayed feeling disjointed in time
brom said ever the sun traces its path from horizon to horizon and ever the moon follows and ever the days roll past without care for the lives they grind away one by ** lowering his eyes brom gazed straight at saphira and through her eragon
try though they might no being escapes death forever not even the elves or the spirits
to all there is an end
if you are watching me eragon then my end has come and i am dead and you know that i am your father
from the leather pouch by his side brom drew forth his pipe filled it with cardus weed then lit it with a soft muttering of ** he puffed on the pipe several times to set the fire before he resumed talking
if you do see this eragon i hope that you are safe and happy and that galbatorix is dead
however i realize that is unlikely if for no other reason than you are a dragon rider and a dragon rider may never rest while there is injustice in the land
a chuckle escaped brom and he shook his head his beard rippling like water
ah i have not the time to say even half of what i would like i would be twice my current age before i finished
in the pursuit of brevity i shall assume that saphira has already told you how your mother and i met how selena died and how i came to be in carvahall
i wish that you and i could have this talk face to face eragon and perhaps we still shall and saphira will have no need to share this memory with you but i doubt it
the sorrows of my years press on me eragon and i feel a cold creeping into my limbs the likes of which has never troubled me before
i think it is because i know it is now your turn to take up the standard
