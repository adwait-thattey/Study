the dwarves feldunost are like that
right you are grunted orik
a feldunost can run you up a cliff and down without a single bruise
but how can we carry food and whatnot without saddles i wo not ride while wearing a full pack
lifaen tossed a pile of leather bags at orik is feet and indicated the sixth horse
nor will you have to
it took half an hour to arrange their supplies in the bags and heap them into a lumpy mound on the horse is back
afterward nari told eragon and orik the words they could use to direct the horses ganga framto go forward blothr to stop hlaupa if needs you must run andganga aptr to go back
you can give more precise instructions if you know more of the ancient ** he led eragon to a horse and said this is folkvir
hold out your hand
eragon did and the stallion snorted flaring his nostrils
folkvir sniffed eragon is palm then touched it with his muzzle and allowed eragon to stroke his thick neck
good said nari appearing satisfied
the elf had orik do the same with the next horse
as eragon mounted folkvir saphira drew closer
he looked up at her noting how troubled she still seemed from the ** more day he said
eragon
she ** thought of something while i was under the influence of the elves spell something that i have always considered of little consequence but now looms within me like a mountain of black dread every creature no matter how pure or monstrous has a mate of their own kind
yet i have none
she shuddered and closed her ** this regard i am alone
her statements reminded eragon that she was barely more than eight months old
on most occasions her youth did not show due to the influence of her hereditary instincts and memories but in this arena she was even more inexperienced than he was with his feeble stabs at romance in carvahall and tronjheim
pity welled inside eragon but he suppressed it before it could seep across their mental link
saphira would have only contempt for the emotion it could neither solve her problem nor make her feel better
instead he said galbatorix still has two dragon eggs
during our first audience with hrothgar you mentioned that you would like to rescue them
if we can
saphira snorted ** could take years and even if we did retrieve the eggs i have no guarantee that they would hatch nor that they would be male nor that we would be fit mates
fate has abandoned my race to extinction
she lashed her tail with frustration breaking a sapling in two
she seemed perilously close to tears
what can i say he asked disturbed by her ** can not give up hope
you still have a chance to find a mate but you have to be patient
even if galbatorix is eggs do not work dragons must exist elsewhere in the world just like humans elves and urgals do
the moment we are free of our obligations i will help you search for them
all right
all right she sniffed
she craned back her head and released a puff of white smoke that dispersed among the branches ** should know better than to let my emotions get the best of me
nonsense
you would have to be made of stone not to feel this way
it is perfectly normal
but promise you wo not dwell on it while you re alone
she fixed one giant sapphire eye on ** wo not
he turned warm inside as he felt her gratitude for his reassurances and companionship
leaning out from folkvir he put a hand on her rough cheek and held it there for a ** on little one she ** will see you later
eragon hated to leave her in such a state
he reluctantly entered the forest with orik and the elves heading west toward the heart of du weldenvarden
after an hour spent pondering saphira is plight he mentioned it to arya
faint lines creased arya is forehead as she frowned
it is one of galbatorix is greatest crimes
i do not know if a solution exists but we can hope
we must hope
