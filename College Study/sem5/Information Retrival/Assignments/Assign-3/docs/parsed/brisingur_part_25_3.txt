smiling eragon drew a red ribbon from his sleeve and said cross your ** roran and katrina extended their left and right arms respectively and did as he instructed
laying the middle of the ribbon across their wrists eragon wound the strip of satin three times around and then tied the ends together with a bowknot
as is my right as a dragon rider i now declare you man and **
the crowd erupted into cheers
leaning toward each other roran and katrina kissed and the crowd redoubled their cheering
saphira dipped her head toward the beaming couple and as roran and katrina separated she touched each of them on the brow with the tip of her snout
live long and may your love deepen with every passing year she said
roran and katrina turned toward the crowd and raised their joined arms skyward
let the feast ** roran declared
eragon followed the pair as they descended from the hill and walked through the press of shouting people toward two chairs that had been set at the forefront of a row of tables
there roran and katrina sat as the king and queen of their wedding
then the guests lined up to offer their congratulations and pre sent gifts
eragon was first
his grin as large as theirs he shook roran is free hand and inclined his head toward katrina
the honor was ** he looked at both of them then burst out laughing
** the two of you are as happy as fools
eyes sparkling katrina laughed and hugged roran
that we **
growing sober eragon said you must know how fortunate you are to be here today together
roran if you had not been able to rally everyone and travel to the burning plains and if the ra zac had taken you katrina to uru baen neither of you would have
yes but i did and they did not interrupted roran
let us not darken this day with unpleasant thoughts about what might have been
that is not why i mention ** eragon glanced at the line of people waiting behind him making sure they were not close enough to eavesdrop
all three of us are enemies of the empire
and as today has demonstrated we are not safe even here among the varden
if galbatorix can he will strike at any one of us including you katrina in order to hurt the others
so i made these for ** from the pouch at his belt eragon withdrew two plain gold rings polished until they shone
the previous night he had molded them out of the last of the gold orbs he had extracted from the earth
he handed the larger one to roran and the smaller one to katrina
roran turned his ring examining it then held it up against the sky squinting at the glyphs in the ancient language carved into the inside of the band
it is very nice but how can these help protect us
i enchanted them to do three things said eragon
if you ever need my help or saphira is twist the ring once around your finger and say help me shadeslayer help me brightscales and we will hear you and we will come as fast as we can
also if either of you is close to death your ring will alert us and you roran or you katrina depending on who is in peril
and so long as the rings are touching your skin you will always know how to find each other no matter how far apart you may ** he hesitated then added i hope you will agree to wear them
of course we will said katrina
roran is chest swelled and his voice became husky
thank you he said
thank you
i wish we had had these before she and i were separated in carvahall
