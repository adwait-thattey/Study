the very heavens would shatter under the gods ** arya smiled
onlyour prayers and service prevent that from happening
if not for helzvog where
eragon soon lost track of the argument
he did not understand arya is vague criticisms of durgrimst quan but he gathered from gannel is responses that in some indirect way she had implied that the dwarf gods did not exist questioned the mental capacity of every dwarf who entered a temple and pointed out what she took to be flaws in their reasoning all in a pleasant and polite voice
after a few minutes arya raised her hand stopping gannel and said that is the difference between us grimstborith
you devote yourself to that which you believe to be true but cannot prove
there we must agree to ** she turned to eragon then
az sweldn rak anhuin has inflamed tarnag is citizens against you
undin believes as do i that it would be best for you to remain behind his walls until we leave
eragon hesitated
he wanted to see more of celbedeil but if there was to be trouble then his place was by saphira is side
he bowed to gannel and begged to be excused
you need not apologize shadeslayer said the clan chief
he glared at arya
do what you must and may the blessings of guntera be upon you
together eragon and arya departed the temple and surrounded by a dozen warriors trotted through the city
as they did eragon heard shouts from an angry mob on a lower tier
a stone skipped over a nearby roof
the motion drew his eye to a dark plume of smoke rising from the city is edge
once in the hall eragon hurried to his room
there he slipped on his mail hauberk strapped the greaves to his shins and the bracers to his forearms jammed the leather cap coif and then helm over his head and grabbed his shield
scooping up his pack and saddlebags he ran back to the courtyard where he sat against saphira is right foreleg
tarnag is like an overturned anthill she observed
let is hope we do not get bitten
arya joined them before long as did a group of fifty heavily armed dwarves who settled in the middle of the courtyard
the dwarves waited impassively talking in low grunts as they eyed the barred gate and the mountain that rose up behind them
they fear said arya seating herself by eragon that the crowds may prevent us from reaching the rafts
saphira can always fly us out
snowfire as well and undin is guards no if we are stopped we shall have to wait until the dwarves outrage ** she studied the darkening sky
it is unfortunate that you managed to offend so many dwarves but perhaps inevitable
the clans have ever been contentious what pleases one infuriates another
he fingered the edge of his mail
i wish now i had not accepted hrothgar is offer
ah yes
as with nasuada i think you made the only viable choice
you are not to blame
the fault if any lies with hrothgar for making the offer in the first place
he must have been well aware of the repercussions
silence reigned for several minutes
a half dozen dwarves marched around the courtyard stretching their legs
finally eragon asked do you have any family in du weldenvarden
it was a long time before arya answered
none that i am close to
why
why is that
she hesitated again
they disliked my choice to become the queen is envoy and ambassador it seemed inappropriate
when i ignored their objections and still had the yawe tattooed on my shoulder which indicates that i have devoted myself to the greater good of our race as is the case with your ring from brom my family refused to see me again
but that was over seventy years ago he protested
arya looked away concealing her face behind a veil of hair
eragon tried to imagine what it must have been like for her ostracized from her family and sent to live among two completely different ** wonder she is so withdrawn he realized
are there any other elves outside of du weldenvarden
still keeping her face covered she said three of us were sent forth from ellesmera
faolin and glenwing always traveled with me when we transported saphira is egg between du weldenvarden and tronjheim
only i survived durza is ambush
proud warriors
