closing his eyes roran consciously relaxed all the muscles in his body seeking to calm himself
i kill for my love
i kill for my love of katrina and for my love of eragon and everyone from carvahall and also for my love of the varden and my love of this land of ours
for my love i will wade through an ocean of blood even if it destroys me
never seen the likes o that before stronghammer said ulhart
roran opened his eyes to find the grizzled warrior standing in front of him holding snowfire by the reins
no one else crazy enough to try a trick like that jumping over the wagons none that lived to tell the tale nohow
good job that
watch yourself though
ca not go around leaping off horses an taking on five men yourself an expect to see another summer eh bit of caution if you re wise
i will keep that in mind said roran as he accepted snowfire is reins from ulhart
in the minutes since roran had disposed of the last of the soldiers the uninjured warriors had been going to each of the wagons in the convoy cutting open their bundles of cargo and reporting the contents to martland who recorded what they found so nasuada could study the information and perhaps gather from it some indication of galbatorix is plans
roran watched as the men examined the last few wagons which contained bags of wheat and stacks of uniforms
that finished the men slit the throats of the remaining oxen soaking the road with blood
killing the beasts bothered roran but he understood the importance of denying them to the empire and would have wielded the knife himself if asked
they would have taken the oxen back to the varden but the animals were too slow and cumbersome
the soldiers horses however could keep pace as they fled enemy territory so they captured as many as they could and tied them behind their own steeds
then one of the men took a resin soaked torch from his saddlebags and after a few seconds of work with his flint and steel lit it
riding up and down the convoy he pressed the torch against each wagon until it caught fire and then tossed the torch into the back of the last wagon
roran is leg throbbed as he pulled himself onto snowfire
he spurred the stallion over next to carn as the surviving men assembled on their steeds in a double line behind martland
the horses snorted and pawed at the ground impatient to put distance between themselves and the fire
martland started forward at a swift trot and the rest of the group followed leaving behind them the line of burning wagons like so many glowing beads strung out upon the lonely road
