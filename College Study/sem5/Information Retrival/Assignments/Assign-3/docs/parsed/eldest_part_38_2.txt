no one was at the door
proceeding inward nasuada saw that the walls and ceiling were swathed with layers of dark fabric giving the place the appearance of a cave or lair
to her surprise the air was quite cold almost chilly like a brisk autumn night
apprehension sank its poisonous claws into her **
a black mesh curtain blocked her way
brushing it aside she found herself in what was once a sitting room
the furniture had been removed except for a line of chairs pushed against the shrouded walls
a cluster of faint dwarf lanterns were hung in a dimple of the sagging fabric overhead casting weird multicolored shadows in every direction
a bent crone watched her from the depths of one corner bracketed by angela the herbalist and the werecat who stood with his hackles raised
in the center of the room knelt a pale girl that nasuada took to be three or four years old
the girl picked at a platter of food on her lap
no one spoke
confused nasuada asked where is the baby
nasuada gasped as she saw the dragon mark bright upon the child is brow and as she peered deep into her violet eyes
the girl quirked her lips with a terrible knowing smile
i am elva
nasuada recoiled without thinking clutching at the dagger she kept strapped to her left forearm
it was an adult is voice and filled with an adult is experience and cynicism
it sounded profane coming from the mouth of a child
do not run said elva
i am your ** she put the platter aside it was empty now
to the crone she said more ** the old woman hurried from the room
then elva patted the floor beside her
please sit
i have been waiting for you ever since i learned to talk
keeping her grip on her dagger nasuada lowered herself to the stones
when was that
last ** elva folded her hands in her lap
she fixed her ghastly eyes on nasuada pinning her in place through the unnatural strength of her gaze
nasuada felt as if a violet lance had pierced her skull and was twisting inside her mind tearing apart her thoughts and memories
she fought the desire to scream
leaning forward elva reached out and cupped nasuada is cheek with one soft hand
you know ajihad could not have led the varden better than you have
you chose the correct path
your name will be praised for centuries for having the courage and foresight to move the varden to surda and attack the empire when everyone else thought it was insane to do so
nasuada gaped at the girl stunned
like a key matched to a lock elva is words perfectly addressed nasuada is primal fears the doubts that kept her awake at night sweating in the darkness
an involuntary surge of emotion rushed through her bolstering her with a sense of confidence and peace that she had not possessed since before ajihad is death
tears of relief burst from her eyes and rolled down her face
it was as if elva had known exactly what to say in order to comfort her
her euphoria warred against her distaste for how this moment of weakness had been induced and by whom
nor did she trust the girl is motivation
i am what eragon made me
the dreadful ancient eyes were obscured for a moment as elva blinked
he did not understand his actions
since eragon ensorcelled me whenever i see a person i sense all the hurts that beset him and are about to beset him
when i was smaller i could do nothing about it
so i grew bigger
the magic in my blood drives me to protect people from pain
no matter the injury to myself or whether i want to help or ** her smile acquired a bitter twist
it costs me dearly if i resist the urge
as nasuada digested the implications she realized that elva is unsettling aspect was a by product of the suffering that she had been exposed to
nasuada shivered at the thought of what the girl had ** must have torn her apart to have this compulsion and yet be unable to act on it
against her better judgment she began to feel a measure of sympathy for elva
why have you told me this
i thought that you should know who and what i ** elva paused and the fire in her gaze strengthened
and that i will fight for you however i can
use me as you would an assassin in hiding in the dark and without ** she laughed with a high chilling voice
