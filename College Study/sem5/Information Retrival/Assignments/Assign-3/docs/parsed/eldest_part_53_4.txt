when the merchant fell silent roran gathered at the far end of the study with loring birgit and nolfavrell and asked their thoughts
lowering his voice loring said i can not tell whether he is lying or not but any man who can weave a yarn like that at knifepoint deserves to live
a new ** and eragon to ** he shook his head
i do not know
it is so outlandish
she hesitated
but it must be true
another rider is the only thing that would spur the empire to pursue us so fiercely
aye agreed loring
his eyes were bright with excitement
we ve been entangled in far moremomentous events than we realized
a new rider
just think about ** the old order is about to be washed away i tell you
you were right all along roran
the boy looked solemn at being asked
he bit his lip then said jeod seems honest enough
ithink we can trust him
right then said roran
he strode back to jeod planted his knuckles on the edge of the desk and said two last questions longshanks
what do brom and eragon look like and how did you recognize gertrude is name
i knew of gertrude because brom mentioned that he left a letter for you in her care
as for what they looked like brom stood a bit shorter than me
he had a thick beard a hooked nose and he carried a carved staff with him
and i dare say he was rather irritable at ** roran nodded that was brom
eragon was
young
brown hair brown eyes with a scar on his wrist and he never stopped asking ** roran nodded again that was his cousin
roran stuck his hammer back under his belt
birgit loring and nolfavrell sheathed their blades
then roran pulled his chair away from the door and the four of them resumed their seats like civilized beings
what now jeod asked roran
can you help us i know you re in a difficult situation but we
we are desperate and have no one else to turn to
as an agent of the varden can you guarantee us the varden is protection we are willing to serve them if they will shield us from galbatorix is wrath
the varden said jeod would be more than happy to have you
more than happy
i suspect you already guessed that
as for help
he ran a hand down his long face and stared past loring at the rows of books on the shelves
i ve been aware for almost a year that my true identity as well as that of many other merchants here and elsewhere who have assisted the varden was betrayed to the empire
because of that i have not dared flee to surda
if i tried the empire would arrest me and then who knows what horrors i d be in for i ve had to watch the gradual destruction of my business without being able to take any action to oppose or escape it
what is worse now that i cannot ship anything to the varden and they dare not send envoys to me i feared that lord risthart would have me clapped in irons and dragged off to the dungeons since i am of no further interest to the empire
i ve expected it every day since i declared bankruptcy
perhaps suggested birgit they want you to flee so they can capture whoever else you bring with you
jeod smiled
perhaps
but now that you are here i have a means to leave that they never anticipated
then you have a plan asked loring
glee crossed jeod is face
oh yes i have a plan
did the four of you see the shipdragon wing moored at port
roran thought back to the vessel
aye
thedragon wing is owned by the blackmoor shipping company a front for the empire
they handle supplies for the army which has mobilized to an alarming degree recently conscripting soldiers among the peasants and commandeering horses asses and ** jeod raised an eyebrow
i am not sure what it indicates but it is possible galbatorix means to march on surda
in any case thedragon wing is to sail for feinster within the week
she is the finest ship ever built from a new design by master shipwright kinnell
and you want to pirate her concluded roran
i do
not only to spite the empire or because thedragon wing is reputed to be the fastest square rigged ship of her tonnage but because she is already fully provisioned for a long voyage
and since her cargo is food we d have enough for the whole village
loring uttered a strained cackle
