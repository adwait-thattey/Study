glaedr grunted as an unseen force brought their fall to an abrupt halt nearly shaking him loose from thorn is leg and then lifted the four of them up through the sky higher and higher until the broken anthill city was only a faint blotch below and even glaedr had difficulty breathing in the rarefied air
what is the youngling doing glaedr wondered concerned
is he trying to kill himself
then murtagh resumed speaking and when he did his voice was richer and deeper than before and it echoed as if he were standing in an empty hall
glaedr felt the scales on his shoulders crawl as he recognized the voice of their ancient foe
so you survived oromis glaedr said galbatorix
his words were round and smooth like those of a practiced orator and their tone was deceptively friendly
long have i thought that the elves might be hiding a dragon or a rider from my sight
it is gratifying to have my suspicions **
begone foul oath ** cried oromis
you shall not have any satisfaction from **
galbatorix chuckled
such a harsh greeting
for shame oromis elda
have the elves forgotten their fabled courtesy over the past century
you deserve no more courtesy than a rabid **
tut tut oromis
remember what you said to me when i stood before you and the other elders anger is a poison
you must purge it from your mind or else it will corrupt your better ** you should heed your own **
you cannot confuse me with your snake is tongue galbatorix
you are an abomination and we shall see to it that you are eliminated even if it costs us our **
but why should it oromis why should you pit yourself against me it saddens me that you have allowed your hate to distort your wisdom for you were wise once oromis perhaps the wisest member of our entire order
you were the first to recognize the madness eating away at my soul and it was you who convinced the other elders to deny my request for another dragon egg
that was very wise of you oromis
futile but wise
and somehow you managed to escape from kialandi and formora even after they had broken you and then you hid until all but one of your enemies had died
that too was wise of you **
a brief pause marked galbatorix is speech
there is no need to continue fighting me
i freely admit that i committed terrible crimes in my youth but those days are long past and when i reflect upon the blood i have shed it torments my conscience
still what would you have of me i cannot undo my deeds
now my greatest concern is ensuring the peace and prosperity of the empire over which i find myself lord and master
cannot you see that i have lost my thirst for vengeance the rage that drove me for so many years has burned itself to ashes
ask yourself this oromis who is responsible for the war that has swept across alagaesia not i
the varden were the ones who provoked this conflict
i would have been content to rule my people and leave the elves and the dwarves and the surdans to their own devices
but the varden could not leave well enough alone
it was they who chose to steal saphira is egg and they who cover the earth with mountains of corpses
not i
you were wise once before oromis and you can become wise once again
give up your hatred and join me in ilirea
with you by my side we can bring an end to this conflict and usher in an era of peace that will endure for a thousand years or **
glaedr was not persuaded
he tightened his crushing piercing jaws causing thorn to yowl
the pain noise seemed incredibly loud after galbatorix is speech
in clear ringing tones oromis said no
you cannot make us forget your atrocities with a balm of honeyed lies
release ** you have not the means to hold us here much longer and i refuse to exchange pointless banter with a traitor like **
** you are a senile old fool said galbatorix and his voice acquired a harsh angry cast
you should have accepted my offer you would have been first and foremost among my slaves
i will make you regret your mindless devotion to your so called justice
and you are wrong
i can keep you thus as long as i want for i have become as powerful as a god and there are none who can stop **
