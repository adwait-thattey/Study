nasuada crossed her arms without bothering to conceal her impatience as she examined the two men before her
the one on the right had a neck so thick it forced his head to jut forward at nearly right angles to his shoulders giving him a stubborn dim witted appearance
this was intensified by his heavy brow with its two cliffs of matted hair almost long enough to pull over his eyes and bulbous lips that remained puckered into a pink mushroom even when he spoke
she knew better than to put stock in his repulsive looks though
no matter its rough housing his tongue was as clever as a jester is
the only identifying feature of the second man was his pale skin which refused to darken under surda is relentless sun even though the varden had been in aberon the capital for some weeks now
from his coloring nasuada guessed he had been born in the northern reaches of the empire
he held a knit wool cap that he wrung into a hard rope between his hands
you she said pointing at him
how many of your chickens did he kill again
nasuada returned her attention to the ugly man
an unlucky number by all accounts master gamble
and so it has proved for you
you are guilty of both theft and destroying someone else is property without offering proper recompense
i only wonder how you ate thirteen chickens in four days
are youever full master gamble
he gave her a jocular grin and scratched the side of his face
the rasp of his untrimmed fingernails over his stubble annoyed her and it was only with an effort of will that she kept from asking him to stop
well not to be disrespectful ma am but filling my stomach would not be a problem if you fed us properly what with all the work we do
i am a large man an i need a bit o meat in my belly after half a day breaking rocks with a mattock
i did my best to resist temptation i did
but three weeks of short rations and watching these farmers drive around fat livestock they would not share even if a body were starving
well i will admit it broke me
i am not a strong man when it comes to food
i like it hot and i like plenty of it
an i do not fancy i am the only one willing to help himself
and that is the heart of the problem reflected nasuada
the varden could not afford to feed its members not even with surda is king orrin helping
orrin had opened his treasury to them but he had refused to behave as galbatorix was wont to do when moving his army across the empire which was to appropriate supplies from his countrymen without paying for ** noble sentiment but one that only makes my task harder
still she knew that acts like those were what separated her orrin hrothgar and islanzadi from galbatorix is ** would be so easy to cross that divide without noticing it
i understand your reasons master gamble
however although the varden are not a country and we answer to no one is authority but our own that doesnot give you or anyone else leave to ignore the rule of law as laid down by my predecessors or as it is observed here in surda
therefore i order you to pay a copper for each chicken you stole
gamble surprised her by acceding without protest
as you wish ma am he said
that is it exclaimed the pale man
he wrung his cap even tighter
that is no fair price
if i sold them in any market they d
she could not contain herself any longer
** you d get more
but i happen to know that master gamble cannot afford to give you the chickens full price as i am the one who provides his ** as i do yours
you forget that if i decided to acquire your poultry for the good of the varden you d get no more than a copper a chicken and be lucky at that
am i understood
after a moment the pale man subsided and muttered yes ma am
very well
you re both ** with an expression of sardonic admiration gamble touched his brow and bowed to nasuada before backing out of the stone room with his sullen opponent
you too she said to the guards on either side of the door
as soon as they were gone she slumped in her chair with an exhausted sigh and reached for her fan batting it over her face in a futile attempt to dissipate the pinpricks of sweat that accumulated on her forehead
