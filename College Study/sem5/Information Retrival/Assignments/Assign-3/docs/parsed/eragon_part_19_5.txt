we will take it easy promised brom
he gave eragon a few pointers then they started off at a gentle pace
before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields yielded to wilder land
brambles and tangled weeds lined the road along with huge rosebushes that clung to their clothes
tall rocks slanted out of the ground gray witnesses to their presence
there was an unfriendly feel in the air an animosity that resisted intruders
above them growing larger with every step loomed utgard its craggy precipices deeply furrowed with snowy canyons
the black rock of the mountain absorbed light like a sponge and dimmed the surrounding area
between utgard and the line of mountains that formed the east side of palancar valley was a deep cleft
it was the only practical way out of the valley
the road led toward it
the horses hooves clacked sharply over gravel and the road dwindled to a skinny trail as it skirted the base of utgard
eragon glanced up at the peak looming over them and was startled to see a steepled tower perched upon it
the turret was crumbling and in disrepair but it was still a stern sentinel over the valley
what is that he asked pointing
brom did not look up but said sadly and with bitterness an outpost of the riders one that has lasted since their founding
that was where vrael took refuge and where through treachery he was found and defeated by galbatorix
when vrael fell this area was tainted
edoc isil unconquerable was the name of this bastion for the mountain is so steep none may reach the top unless they can fly
after vrael is death the commoners called it utgard but it has another name ristvak baen the place of ** it was known as such to the last riders before they were killed by the king
eragon stared with awe
here was a tangible remnant of the riders glory tarnished though it was by the relentless pull of time
it struck him then just how old the riders were
a legacy of tradition and heroism that stretched back to antiquity had fallen upon him
they traveled for long hours around utgard
it formed a solid wall to their right as they entered the breach that divided the mountain range
eragon stood in his stirrups he was impatient to see what lay outside of palancar but it was still too far away
for a while they were in a sloped pass winding over hill and gully following the anora river
then with the sun low behind their backs they mounted a rise and saw over the trees
eragon gasped
on either side were mountains but below them stretched a huge plain that extended to the distant horizon and fused into the sky
the plain was a uniform tan like the color of dead grass
long wispy clouds swept by overhead shaped by fierce winds
he understood now why brom had insisted on horses
it would have taken them weeks or months to cover that vast distance on foot
far above he saw saphira circling high enough to be mistaken for a bird
we will wait until tomorrow to make the descent said brom
it is going to take most of the day so we should camp now
how far across is the plain eragon asked still amazed
two or three days to over a fortnight depending on which direction we go
aside from the nomad tribes that roam this section of the plains it is almost as uninhabited as the hadarac desert to the east
so we are not going to find many villages
however to the south the plains are less arid and more heavily populated
they left the trail and dismounted by the anora river
as they unsaddled the horses brom gestured at the bay
you should name him
eragon considered it as he picketed the bay
well i do not have anything as noble as snowfire but maybe this will ** he placed his hand on the bay and said i name you cadoc
it was my grandfather is name so bear it ** brom nodded in approval but eragon felt slightly foolish
when saphira landed he asked how do the plains look
dull
there is nothing but rabbits and scrub in every direction
after dinner brom stood and barked ** eragon barely had time to raise his arm and grab the piece of wood before it hit him on the head
he groaned as he saw another makeshift sword
