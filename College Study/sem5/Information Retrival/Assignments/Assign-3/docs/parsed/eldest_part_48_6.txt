saphira is eyes twinkled with ** licking the molten rock
then she bent and breathed fire long upon the stone bathing it in a golden pillar that ascended toward the stars and clawed at them with lucent fingers
when saphira closed her jaws the paper thin edges of the sculpture glowed cherry red while small flames flickered in the dark hollows and recesses throughout the rock
the flowing strands of rock seemed to move under the hypnotic light
the elves exclaimed with wonder clapping their hands and dancing about the piece
an elf cried well wrought **
saphira touched him on the arm with her ** you little one
then glaedr brought out his offering a slab of red oak that he had carved with the point of one talon into a likeness of ellesmera as seen from high above
and oromis revealed his contribution the completed scroll that eragon had often watched him illustrate during their lessons
along the top half of the scroll marched columns of glyphs a copy of the lay of vestari the mariner while along the bottom half ran a panorama of a fantastic landscape rendered with breathtaking artistry detail and skill
arya took eragon is hand then and drew him through the forest and toward the menoa tree where she said look how the werelight dims
we have but a few hours left to us before dawn arrives and we must return to the world of cold reason
around the tree the host of elves gathered their faces bright with eager anticipation
with great dignity islanzadi emerged from within their midst and walked along a root as wide as a pathway until it angled upward and doubled back on itself
she stood upon the gnarled shelf overlooking the slender waiting elves
as is our custom and as was agreed upon at the end of the dragon war by queen tarmunora the first eragon and the white dragon who represented his race he whose name cannot be uttered in this or any language when they bound the fates of elves and dragons together we have met to honor our blood oath with song and dance and the fruits of our labor
last this celebration occurred many long years ago our situation was desperate indeed
it has improved somewhat since the result of our efforts the dwarves and the varden is though alagaesia still lies under the black shadow of the wyrdfell and we must still live with our shame of how we have failed the dragons
of the riders of eld only oromis and glaedr remain
brom and many others entered the void this past century
however new hope has been granted to us in the form of eragon and saphira and it is only right and proper that they should be here now as we reaffirm the oath between our races three
at the queen is signal the elves cleared a wide expanse at the base of the menoa tree
around the perimeter they staked a ring of lanterns mounted upon carved poles while musicians with flutes harps and drums assembled along the ridge of one long root
guided by arya to the edge of the circle eragon found himself seated between her and oromis while saphira and glaedr crouched on either side of them like gem studded bluffs
to eragon and saphira oromis said watch you carefully for this is of great importance to your heritage as riders
when all the elves were settled two elf maids walked to the center of the space in the host and stood with their backs to each other
they were exceedingly beautiful and identical in every respect except for their hair one had tresses as black as a forgotten pool while the other is hair gleamed like burnished silver wire
the caretakers iduna and neya whispered oromis
moving in unison the two elves raised their hands to the brooches at their throats unclasped them and allowed their white robes to fall away
though they wore no garments the women were clad in an iridescent tattoo of a dragon
the tattoo began with the dragon is tail wrapped around the left ankle of iduna continued up her leg and thigh over her torso and then across neya is back ending with the dragon is head on neya is chest
every scale on the dragon was inked a different color the vibrant hues gave the tattoo the appearance of a rainbow
