no matter how much she wriggled she could not touch the ground nor could she fly any higher
how can he still be human and have the strength to do that wondered ** with my new abilities such a task would leave me gasping for air and unable to walk
relying upon his experience counteracting oromis is spells eragon said brakka du vanyali sem huildar saphira un **
murtagh made no attempt to stop him only gave him a flat stare as if he found eragon is resistance a pointless inconvenience
baring his teeth eragon redoubled his efforts
his hands went cold his bones ached and his pulse slowed as the magic sapped his energy
without being asked saphira joined forces with him granting him access to the formidable resources of her body
five seconds passed
twenty seconds
a thick vein pulsed on murtagh is neck
a minute and a half
involuntary tremors racked eragon
his quadriceps and hamstrings fluttered and his legs would have given way if he were free to move
two minutes passed
at last eragon was forced to release the magic else he risked falling unconscious and passing into the void
he sagged utterly spent
he had been afraid before but only because he thought he might fail
now he was afraid because he did not know what murtagh was capable of
you cannot hope to compete with me said murtagh
no one can except for ** walking up to eragon he pointed his sword at eragon is neck pricking his skin
eragon resisted the impulse to flinch
it would be so easy to take you back to uru baen
eragon gazed deep into his eyes
do not
let me go
you just tried to kill me
and you would have done the same in my ** when murtagh remained silent and expressionless eragon said we were friends once
we fought together
galbatorix can not have twisted you so much that you ve forgotten
if you do this murtagh you will be lost forever
a long minute passed where the only sound was the hue and cry of the clashing armies
blood trickled down eragon is neck from where the sword point cut him
saphira lashed her tail with helpless rage
finally murtagh said i was ordered to try and capture you and ** he paused
i have tried
make sure we do not cross paths again
galbatorix will have me swear additional oaths in the ancient language that will prevent me from showing you such mercy when next we ** he lowered his sword
you re doing the right thing said eragon
he tried to step back but was still held in place
perhaps
but before i let you go
reaching out murtagh pried zar roc from eragon is fist and unbuckled zar roc is red sheath from the belt of beloth the wise
if i have become my father then i will have my father is blade
thorn is my dragon and a thorn he shall be to all our enemies
it is only right then that i should also wield the swordmisery
misery and thorn a fit match
besides zar roc should have gone to morzan is eldest son not his youngest
it is mine by right of birth
a cold pit formed in eragon is ** can not be
a cruel smile appeared on murtagh is face
i never told you my mother is name did i and you never told me yours
i will say it now selena
selena was my mother and your mother
morzan was our father
the twins figured out the connection while they were digging around in your head
galbatorix was quite interested to learn that particular piece of information
you re ** cried eragon
he could not bear the thought of being morzan is ** brom know does oromis know
why did not they tell me he remembered then angela predicting that someone in his family would betray ** was right
murtagh merely shook his head and repeated his words in the ancient language then put his lips to eragon is ear and whispered you and i we are the same eragon
mirror images of one another
you can not deny it
you re wrong growled eragon struggling against the spell
we re nothing alike
i do not have a scar on my back anymore
murtagh recoiled as if he had been stung his face going hard and cold
he lifted zar roc and held it upright before his chest
so be it
i take my inheritance from you brother
farewell
then he retrieved his helm from the ground and pulled himself onto thorn
not once did he look at eragon as the dragon crouched raised its wings and flew off the plateau and into the north
