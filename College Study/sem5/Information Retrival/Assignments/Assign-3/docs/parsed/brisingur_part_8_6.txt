he disliked the elves formality but most of all he hated trying to interpret their enigmatic statements
was he warning me that scheming and plotting around the queen is a dangerous pastime or that islanzadi is a drawn bow about to snap or did he mean something else entirely
at least i am able to contact the elves thought eragon
the elves wards prevented anything from entering du weldenvarden by magical means including the far sight of scrying
so long as elves remained in their cities one could communicate with them only by sending messengers into their forest
but now that the elves were on the move and had left the shade of their black needled pine trees their great spells no longer protected them and it was possible to use devices such as the seeing glass
eragon became increasingly anxious as first one minute and then another trickled past
come on he murmured
he quickly glanced around to make sure that no person or beast was creeping up on him while he gazed into the pool of water
with a sound akin to ripping cloth the entrance flap to the tent flew open as queen islanzadi thrust it aside and stormed toward the seeing glass
she wore a bright corselet of golden scale armor augmented with mail and greaves and a beautifully decorated helm set with opals and other precious gemstones that held back her flowing black tresses
a red cape trimmed with white billowed from her shoulders it reminded eragon of a looming storm front
in her left hand islanzadi wielded a naked sword
her right hand was empty but it appeared gloved in crimson and after a moment eragon realized that dripping blood coated her fingers and wrist
islanzadi is slanting eyebrows narrowed as she looked upon eragon
with that expression she bore a striking resemblance to arya although her stature and bearing were even more impressive than her daughter is
she was beautiful and terrible like a frightful goddess of war
eragon touched his lips with his fingers then twisted his right hand over his chest in the elves gesture of loyalty and respect and recited the opening line of their traditional greeting speaking first as was proper when addressing one of higher rank
islanzadi made the expected response and in an attempt to please her and demonstrate his knowledge of their customs eragon concluded with the optional third line of the salutation and may peace live in your heart
the ferocity of islanzadi is pose diminished somewhat and a faint smile touched her lips as if to acknowledge his maneuver
and yours as well ** her low rich voice contained hints of rustling pine needles and gurgling brooks and music played on reed pipes
sheathing her sword she moved across the tent to the folding table and stood at an angle to eragon as she washed the blood off her skin with water from a pitcher
peace is difficult to come by these days i fear
the fighting is heavy your majesty
it will be soon
my people are massing along the western edge of du weldenvarden where we may prepare to kill and be killed while we are close to the trees we love so much
we are a scattered race and do not march in rank and file like others do on account of the damage it inflicts upon the land and so it takes time for us to assemble from the distant reaches of the forest
i understand
only
he searched for a way to ask his question without being rude
if the fighting has not started yet i cannot help but wonder why your hand is dyed with gore
shaking water droplets off her fingers islanzadi lifted her perfect gold brown forearm for eragon is inspection and he realized that she had been the model for the sculpture of two intertwined arms that stood in the entryway to his tree house in ellesmera
dyed no more
the only stain blood leaves on a person is on her soul not her body
i said the fighting would escalate in the near future not that we had yet to ** she pulled the sleeve of her corselet and the tunic underneath back down to her wrist
from the jeweled belt wrapped around her slim waist she removed a gauntlet stitched with silver thread and worked her hand into it
