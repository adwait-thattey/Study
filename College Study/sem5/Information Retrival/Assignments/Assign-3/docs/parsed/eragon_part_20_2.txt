fatigue made it hard on both of them so they kept the session short
after they had eaten they lay next to saphira and slept grateful for her shelter
the same cold wind greeted them in the morning sweeping over the dreadful flatness
eragon is lips had cracked during the night every time he smiled or talked beads of blood covered them
licking them only made it worse
it was the same for brom
they let the horses drink sparingly from their supply of water before mounting them
the day was a monotonous trek of endless plodding
on the third day eragon woke well rested
that coupled with the fact that the wind had stopped put him in a cheery humor
his high spirits were dampened however when he saw the sky ahead of them was dark with thunderheads
brom looked at the clouds and grimaced
normally i would not go into a storm like that but we re in for a battering no matter what we do so we might as well get some distance covered
it was still calm when they reached the storm front
as they entered its shadow eragon looked up
the thundercloud had an exotic structure forming a natural cathedral with a massive arched roof
with some imagination he could see pillars windows soaring tiers and snarling gargoyles
it was a wild beauty
as eragon lowered his gaze a giant ripple raced toward them through the grass flattening it
it took him a second to realize that the wave was a tremendous blast of wind
brom saw it too and they hunched their shoulders preparing for the storm
the gale was almost upon them when eragon had a horrible thought and twisted in his saddle yelling both with his voice and mind ** ** brom is face grew pale
overhead they saw her dive toward the ** is not going to make it
saphira angled back the way they had come to gain time
as they watched the tempest is wrath struck them like a hammer blow
eragon gasped for breath and clenched the saddle as a frenzied howling filled his ears
cadoc swayed and dug his hooves into the ground mane snapping in the air
the wind tore at their clothes with invisible fingers while the air darkened with billowing clouds of dust
eragon squinted searching for saphira
he saw her land heavily and then crouch clenching the ground with her talons
the wind reached her just as she started to fold her wings
with an angry yank it unfurled them and dragged her into the air
for a moment she hung there suspended by the storm is force
then it slammed her down on her back
with a savage wrench eragon yanked cadoc around and galloped back up the trail goading the horse with both heels and ** he ** to stay on the ground
i am ** he felt a grim acknowledgment from her
as they neared saphira cadoc balked so eragon leapt down and ran toward her
his bow banged against his head
a strong gust pushed him off balance and he flew forward landing on his chest
he skidded then got back up with a snarl ignoring the deep scrapes in his skin
saphira was only three yards away but he could get no closer because of her flailing wings
she struggled to fold them against the overpowering gale
he rushed at her right wing intending to hold it down but the wind caught her and she somersaulted over him
the spines on her back missed his head by inches
saphira clawed at the ground trying to stay down
her wings began to lift again but before they could flip her eragon threw himself at the left one
the wing crumpled in at the joints and saphira tucked it firmly against her body
eragon vaulted over her back and tumbled onto the other wing
without warning it was blown upward sending him sliding to ground
he broke his fall with a roll then jumped up and grabbed the wing again
saphira started to fold it and he pushed with all of his strength
the wind battled with them for a second but with one last surge they overcame it
eragon leaned against saphira ** you all right he could feel her trembling
she took a moment to **
i think so
she sounded ** is broken i could not do anything the wind would not let me go
i was helpless
with a shudder she fell silent
he looked at her ** not worry you re safe now
he spotted cadoc a ways off standing with his back to the wind
