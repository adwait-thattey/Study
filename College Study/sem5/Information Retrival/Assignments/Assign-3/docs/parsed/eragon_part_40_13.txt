using the ancient language he told them that unless they swam through the waterfall they would be killed and eaten by the urgals
though they did not understand everything he said the meaning of his words was unmistakable
snowfire and tornac tossed their heads then dashed into the thundering downpour whinnying as it struck their backs
they floundered struggling to stay above water
murtagh sheathed his sword and jumped after them his head disappeared under a froth of bubbles before he bobbed up sputtering
the urgals were right behind eragon he could hear their feet crunching on the gravel
with a fierce war cry he leapt after murtagh closing his eyes a second before the cold water pummeled him
the tremendous weight of the waterfall slammed down on his shoulders with backbreaking force
the water is mindless roar filled his ears
he was driven to the bottom where his knees gouged the rocky lakebed
he kicked off with all his strength and shot partway out of the water
before he could take a gulp of air the cascade rammed him back underwater
all he could see was a white blur as foam billowed around him
he frantically tried to surface and relieve his burning lungs but he only rose a few feet before the deluge halted his ascent
he panicked thrashing his arms and legs fighting the water
weighed down by zar roc and his drenched clothes he sank back to the lakebed unable to speak the ancient words that could save him
suddenly a strong hand grasped the back of his tunic and dragged him through the water
his rescuer sliced through the lake with quick short strokes eragon hoped it was murtagh not an urgal
they surfaced and stumbled onto the pebble beach
eragon was trembling violently his entire body shivered in bursts
sounds of combat erupted to his right and he whirled toward them expecting an urgal attack
the monsters on the opposite shore where he had stood only moments before fell beneath a withering hail of arrows from crevasses that pockmarked the cliff
scores of urgals already floated belly up in the water riddled with shafts
the ones on eragon is shore were similarly engaged
neither group could retreat from their exposed positions for rows of warriors had somehow appeared behind them where the lake met the mountainsides
all that prevented the nearest kull from rushing eragon was the steady rain of arrows the unseen archers seemed determined to keep the urgals at bay
a gruff voice next to eragon said akh gunteraz ** what were they thinking you would have ** eragon jerked with surprise
it was not murtagh standing by him but a diminutive man no taller than his elbow
the dwarf was busy wringing water out of his long braided beard
his chest was stocky and he wore a chain mail jacket cut off at the shoulders to reveal muscular arms
a war ax hung from a wide leather belt strapped around his waist
an iron bound oxhide cap bearing the symbol of a hammer surrounded by twelve stars sat firmly on his head
even with the cap he barely topped four feet
he looked longingly at the fighting and said barzul but i wish i could join **
a ** drew zar roc and looked for saphira and murtagh
two twelve foot thick stone doors had opened in the cliff revealing a broad tunnel nearly thirty feet tall that burrowed its way into the mysterious depths of the mountain
a line of flameless lamps filled the passageway with a pale sapphire light that spilled out onto the lake
saphira and murtagh stood before the tunnel surrounded by a grim mixture of men and dwarves
at murtagh is elbow was a bald beardless man dressed in purple and gold robes
he was taller than all the other humans and he was holding a dagger to murtagh is throat
eragon reached for his power but the robed man said in a sharp dangerous voice ** if you use magic i will kill your lovely friend here who was so kind as to mention you re a rider
do not think i wo not know if you re drawing upon it
you can not hide anything from ** eragon tried to speak but the man snarled and pressed the dagger harder against murtagh is throat
none of ** if you say or do anything i do not tell you to he will die
