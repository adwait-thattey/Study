eragon shuddered swayed then fell toward the floor
strong arms caught him at the last second lowering him to the cool marble
he heard orik exclaim from behind him you went too ** he was not strong enough for this
he will live
that is all that is needed answered the bald man curtly
there was an angry grunt
what did you find
well is he to be trusted or not
the words came reluctantly
he
is not your ** there were audible sighs of relief throughout the room
eragon is eyes fluttered open
he gingerly pushed himself upright
easy now said orik wrapping a thick arm around him and helping him to his feet
eragon wove unsteadily glaring at the bald man
a low growl rumbled in saphira is throat
the bald man ignored them
he turned to murtagh who was still being held at sword point
it is your turn now
murtagh stiffened and shook his head
the sword cut his neck slightly
blood dripped down his skin
no
you will not be protected here if you refuse
eragon has been declared trustworthy so you cannot threaten to kill him to influence me
since you can not do that nothing you say or do will convince me to open my mind
sneering the bald man cocked what would have been an eyebrow if he had any
what of your own life i can still threaten that
it wo not do any good said murtagh stonily and with such conviction that it was impossible to doubt his word
the bald man is breath exploded angrily
you do not have a ** he stepped forward and placed his palm on murtagh is brow clenching his hand to hold him in place
murtagh stiffened face growing as hard as iron fists clenched neck muscles bulging
he was obviously fighting the attack with all his strength
the bald man bared his teeth with fury and frustration at the resistance his fingers dug mercilessly into murtagh
eragon winced in sympathy knowing the battle that raged between ** not you help him he asked saphira
no she said ** will allow no one into his mind
orik scowled darkly as he watched the combatants
ilf carnz orodum he muttered then leapt forward and cried that is ** he grabbed the bald man is arm and tore him away from murtagh with strength disproportional to his size
the bald man stumbled back then turned on orik furiously
how dare ** he shouted
you questioned my leadership opened the gates without permission and now ** you ve shown nothing but insolence and treachery
do you think your king will protect you now
orik bristled
you would have let them ** if i had waited any longer the urgals would have killed ** he pointed at murtagh whose breath came in great heaves
we do not have any right to torture him for ** ajihad wo not sanction it
not after you ve examined the rider and found him free of ** they ve brought us arya
would you allow him to enter unchallenged are you so great a fool as to put us all at risk demanded the bald man
his eyes were feral with loosely chained rage he looked ready to tear the dwarf into pieces
can he use magic roared orik his deep voice echoing in the room
the bald man is face suddenly grew expressionless
he clasped his hands behind his back
then what do you fear it is impossible for him to escape and he can not work any devilry with all of us here especially if your powers are as great as you say
but do not listen to me ask ajihad what he wants done
the bald man stared at orik for a moment his face indecipherable then looked at the ceiling and closed his eyes
a peculiar stiffness set into his shoulders while his lips moved soundlessly
an intense frown wrinkled the pale skin above his eyes and his fingers clenched as if they were throttling an invisible enemy
for several minutes he stood thus wrapped in silent communication
when his eyes opened he ignored orik and snapped at the warriors leave ** as they filed through the doorway he addressed eragon coldly because i was unable to complete my examination you and
your friend will remain here for the night
he will be killed if he attempts to ** with those words he turned on his heel and stalked out of the room pale scalp gleaming in the lantern light
thank you whispered eragon to orik
the dwarf grunted
