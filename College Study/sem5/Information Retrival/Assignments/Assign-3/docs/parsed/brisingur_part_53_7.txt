rhunon allowed eragon is tired arms to rest while the blade cooled by air then she had eragon take the blade to another corner of her workshop where she had arranged six different grinding wheels and on a small bench a wide assortment of files scrapers and abrasive stones
she fixed the blade between two blocks of wood and spent the next hour planing the sides of the sword with a drawknife as well as refining the contours of the blade with files
as with the hammering every stroke of the drawknife and every scrape of a file seemed to have twice the effect it normally would it was as if the tools knew exactly how much steel to remove and would remove no more
when she was done filing rhunon built a charcoal fire in her forge and while she waited for the fire to mature she mixed a slurry of dark fine grained clay ash powdered pumice and crystallized juniper sap
she painted the blade with the concoction slathering twice as much on the spine as she did along the edges and by the point
the thicker the solution of clay the slower the underlying metal would cool when it was quenched and as a result the softer that area of the sword would become
the clay lightened as rhunon dried it with a quick incantation
at the direction of the elf woman eragon went to the forge
he lay the sword flat upon the bed of scintillating coals and pumping the bellows with his free hand slowly pulled it toward his hip
once the tip of the blade came free of the fire rhunon turned it over and repeated the sequence
she continued to draw the blade through the coals until both edges had acquired an even orange tone and the spine of the sword was bright red in color
then with a single smooth motion rhunon lifted the sword from the coals swept the glowing bar of steel through the air and plunged it into the trough of water next to the forge
an explosive cloud of steam erupted from the surface of the water which hissed and sizzled and bubbled around the blade
after a minute the roiling water subsided and rhunon withdrew the now pearl gray sword
returning it to the fire she brought the whole sword to the same low heat so as to reduce the brittleness of the edges and then quenched it once more
eragon had expected rhunon to relinquish her hold on his body after they had forged hardened and tempered the blade but to his surprise she remained in his mind and continued to control his limbs
rhunon had him douse the forge then she walked eragon back to the bench with the files and scrapers and abrasive stones
there she sat him and making use of ever finer stones she polished the blade
from her memories eragon learned that she would normally spend a week or more polishing a blade but because of the song they sang she through him was able to complete the task in a mere four hours in addition to carving a narrow groove down the middle of each side of the blade
as the brightsteel grew smoother the true beauty of the metal was revealed within it eragon could see a shimmering cable like pattern every line of which marked the transition between two layers of the velvety steel
and along each edge of the sword was a rippling silvery white band as wide as his thumb which made it appear as if the edges burned with tongues of frozen fire
the muscles in eragon is right arm gave way as rhunon was covering the tang with decorative cross hatching and the file he was holding slipped off the tang and fell from his fingers
the extent of his exhaustion surprised him for he had been concentrating upon the sword to the exclusion of all else
enough said rhunon and she removed herself from eragon is mind without further ado
shocked by her sudden absence eragon swayed on his seat and nearly lost his balance before he regained control over his rebellious limbs
but we re not ** he protested turning toward rhunon
the night sounded unnaturally quiet to him without the strains of their extended duet
rhunon rose from where she had been sitting cross legged against the pole and shook her head
i have no more need of you shadeslayer
go and dream until dawn
