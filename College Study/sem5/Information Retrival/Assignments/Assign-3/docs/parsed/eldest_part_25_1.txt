for three and a half days the citizens of carvahall discussed the latest attack the tragedy of young elmund is death and what could possibly be done to escape their thrice blasted situation
the debate raged with bitter fury through every room of every home
in the space of a word friends turned against friends husbands against wives children against parents only to reconcile moments later in their frantic attempt to discover a means of survival
some said that since carvahall was doomed anyway they might as well kill the ra zac and remaining soldiers so as to at least have their vengeance
others said that if carvahall really was doomed then the only logical course was to surrender and trust themselves to the king is mercy even if it did mean torture and death for roran and enslavement for everyone else
and still others sided with neither opinion but rather descended into a sullen black anger directed at everyone who had brought about this calamity
many did their best to hide their panic in the depths of a tankard
the ra zac themselves had apparently realized that with eleven soldiers dead they no longer had a large enough force to attack carvahall and thus had retreated farther down the road where they were content to post sentinels across palancar valley and wait
wait for flea bitten troops from ceunon or gil ead if you ask me loring said at one meeting
roran listened to that and more kept his own council and silently judged the various schemes
they all seemed dangerously risky
roran still had not told sloan that he and katrina were engaged
he knew it was foolish to wait but he feared how the butcher would react when he learned that roran and katrina had flouted tradition and in doing so undermined sloan is authority
besides there was plenty of work to divert roran is attention he convinced himself that strengthening the fortifications around carvahall was his most important task at the moment
getting people to help was easier than roran anticipated
after the last fight the villagers were more apt to listen and to obey him that is those who did not blame him for causing their predicament
he was mystified by his new authority until he realized that it was the result of the awe respect and perhaps even fear his kills had elicited
they called him stronghammer
roran stronghammer
as night engulfed the valley roran leaned against a corner of horst is dining room his eyes closed
conversation flowed from the men and women seated around the candlelit table
kiselt was in the middle of explaining the state of carvahall is supplies
we wo not starve he concluded but if we can not tend to our fields and our flocks soon we might as well cut our own throats before next winter
it would be a kinder fate
dog tripe or not said gertrude i doubt we will have a chance to find out
we outnumbered the soldiers ten to one when they arrived
they lost eleven men we lost twelve and i am caring for another nine wounded
what happens horst when they outnumberus ten to one
we will give the bards a reason to remember our names retorted the smith
gertrude shook her head sadly
loring banged a fist on the table
and i say it is our turn to strike before weare outnumbered
all we need are a few men shields and spears and we can wipe out theirinfestation
it could be done **
roran shifted restlessly
he had heard all this before and like before loring is proposal ignited an argument that consumed the group
after an hour the debate still showed no sign of being resolved nor had any new ideas been presented except for thane is suggestion that gedric should go tan his own hide which nearly resulted in a fistfight
finally when the conversation lulled roran limped to the table as quickly as his injured calf would allow
i have something to ** for him it was the equivalent of stepping on a long thorn and then yanking it out without stopping to consider the pain it had to be done and the faster the better
all eyes hard soft angry kind indifferent and curious turned to him and roran took a deep breath
indecision will kill us just as surely as a sword or an ** orval rolled his eyes but the rest still listened
