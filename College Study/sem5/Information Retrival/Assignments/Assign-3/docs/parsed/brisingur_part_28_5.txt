now for the difficult part he thought
going to the rear of the tent he slit the taut fabric with his hunting knife and slipped through the opening
sleek as a well fed cat blodhgarm was waiting for him outside
he inclined his head in the general direction of eragon and murmured shadeslayer then devoted his attention to mending the hole which he did with a half dozen short words in the ancient language
eragon drifted down the path between two rows of tents using his knowledge of woodcraft to make as little noise as possible
whenever anyone approached eragon darted off the path and stood motionless hoping they would not notice the footprints of shadow in the dirt or on the grass
he cursed the fact that the land was so dry his boots tended to raise small puffs of dust no matter how gently he lowered them
to his surprise being invisible degraded his sense of balance without the ability to see where his hands or his feet were he kept misjudging distances and bumping into things almost as if he had consumed too much ale
despite his uncertain progress he reached the edge of the camp in fairly good time and without arousing any suspicion
he paused behind a rain barrel hiding his footprints in its thick shadow and studied the packed earth ramparts and ditches lined with sharpened stakes that protected the varden is eastern flank
if he had been trying to enter the camp it would have been extremely difficult to escape detection by one of the many sentinels who patrolled the ramparts even while invisible
but since the trenches and the ramparts had been designed to repel attackers and not imprison the defenders crossing them from the opposite direction was a far easier task
eragon waited until the two closest sentinels had their backs turned toward him and then he sprinted forward pumping his arms with all his might
within seconds he traversed the hundred or so feet that separated the rain barrel from the slope of the rampart and dashed up the embankment so fast he felt as if he were a stone skipping across water
at the crest of the embankment he drove his legs into the ground and arms flailing leaped out over the lines of the varden is defenses
for three silent heartbeats he flew then landed with a bone jarring impact
as soon as he regained his balance eragon pressed himself flat against the ground and held his breath
one of the sentinels paused in his rounds but he did not seem to notice anything out of the ordinary and after a moment he resumed his pacing
eragon released his breath and whispered du deloi lunaea and felt as the spell smoothed out the impressions his boots had left in the embankment
still invisible he stood and trotted away from the camp careful to step only on clumps of grass so he would not kick up more dust
the farther he got from the sentinels the faster he ran until he sped over the land more quickly than a galloping horse
almost an hour later he danced down the steep side of a narrow draw that the wind and rain had etched into the surface of the grasslands
at the bottom was a trickle of water lined with rushes and cattails
he continued downstream staying well away from the soft ground next to the water in an attempt to avoid leaving traces of his passage until the creek widened into a small pond and there by the edge he saw the bulk of a bare chested kull sitting on a boulder
as eragon pushed his way through a stand of cattails the sound of rustling leaves and stalks alerted the kull of his presence
the creature turned his massive horned head toward eragon sniffing at the air
it was nar garzhvog leader of the urgals who had allied themselves with the varden
** exclaimed eragon becoming visible once more
greetings firesword garzhvog rumbled
heaving up his thick limbs and giant torso the urgal rose to his full eight and a half feet his gray skinned muscles rippling in the light of the noonday sun
greetings nar garzhvog said eragon
confused he asked what of your rams who will lead them if you go with me
my blood brother skgahgrezh will lead
he is not kull but he has long horns and a thick neck
