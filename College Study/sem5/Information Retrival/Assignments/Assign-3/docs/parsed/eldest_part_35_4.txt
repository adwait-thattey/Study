in the darkness eragon had to rely on saphira is keen night vision so as to not lose his way
the craggy trees increased in width crowding closer and closer together and threatening to form an impenetrable barrier
just when it appeared that they could go no farther the forest ended and they entered a clearing washed with moonlight from the bright sickle low in the eastern sky
a lone pine tree stood in the middle of the clearing
no taller than the rest of its brethren it was thicker than a hundred regular trees combined in comparison they looked as puny as windblown saplings
a blanket of roots radiated from the tree is massive trunk covering the ground with bark sheathed veins that made it seem as if the entire forest flowed out from the tree as if it were the heart of du weldenvarden itself
the tree presided over the woods like a benevolent matriarch protecting its inhabitants under the shelter of her branches
behold the menoa tree whispered arya
we observe the agaeti blodhren in her shade
a cold tingle crawled down eragon is side as he recognized the name
after angela told his fortune in teirm solembum had come up to him and said when the time comes and you need a weapon look under the roots of the menoa tree
then when all seems lost and your power is insufficient go to the rock of kuthian and speak your name to open the vault of souls
eragon could not imagine what kind of weapon might be buried under the tree nor how he would go about finding it
do you see anything he asked saphira
no but then i doubt that solembum is words will make sense until our need is clear
eragon told arya about both parts of the werecat is counsel although as he had with ajihad and islanzadi he kept angela is prophecy a secret because of its personal nature and because he feared that it might lead arya to guess his attraction to her
when he finished arya said werecats rarely offer help and when they do it is not to be ignored
so far as i know no weapon is hidden here not even in song or legend
as for the rock of kuthian
the name echoes in my head like a voice from a half forgotten dream familiar yet strange
i ve heard it before though i cannot recall where
as they approached the menoa tree eragon is attention was caught by the multitude of ants crawling over the roots
faint black smudges were all he could see of the insects but oromis is assignment had sensitized him to the currents of life around him and he could feel the ants primitive consciousness with his mind
he lowered his defenses and allowed his awareness to flood outward lightly touching saphira and arya and then expanding beyond them to see what else lived in the clearing
with unexpected suddenness he encountered an immense entity a sentient being of such a colossal nature he could not grasp the limits of its psyche
even oromis is vast intellect which eragon had been in contact with in farthen dur was dwarfed in comparison to this presence
the very air seemed to thrum with the energy and strength that emanated from
the tree
deliberate and inexorable the tree is thoughts moved at a measured pace as slow as the creep of ice over granite
it took no notice of eragon nor he was sure of any single individual
it was entirely concerned with the affairs of things that grow and flourish in the bright sunlight with the dogbane and the lily the evening primrose and the silky foxglove and the yellow mustard tall beside the crabapple with its purple blossoms
it is ** exclaimed eragon shocked into speaking
i mean
it is ** he knew that saphira felt it too she cocked her head toward the menoa tree as if listening then flew to one of its branches which were as thick as the road from carvahall to therinsford
there she perched with her tail hanging free waving the tip of it back and forth ever so gracefully
it was such an odd sight a dragon in a tree that eragon almost laughed
of course she is awake said arya
her voice was low and mellow in the night air
shall i tell you the story of the menoa tree
a flash of white streaked across the sky like a banished specter and resolved itself beside saphira in the form of blagden
