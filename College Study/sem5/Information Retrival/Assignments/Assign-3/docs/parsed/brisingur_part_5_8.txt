and keep an eye out for the ra zac
they may try to slip past us and escape helgrind through the entrance we used
they probably have a bolt hole at ground level
probably but i do not think they will run quite yet
after what seemed like an hour trapped in the darkness though eragon knew it could not have been more than ten or fifteen minutes and after descending more than a hundred feet through helgrind eragon stopped on a level patch of stone
transmitting his thoughts to roran he said katrina is cell is about fifty feet in front of us on the right
we can not risk letting her out until the ra zac are dead or gone
what if they wo not reveal themselves until we do let her out for some reason i can not sense them
they could hide from me until doomsday in here
so do we wait for who knows how long or do we free katrina while we still have the chance i can place some wards around her that should protect her from most attacks
roran was quiet for a second
let is free her then
they began to move forward again feeling their way along the squat corridor with its rough unfinished floor
eragon had to devote most of his attention to his footing in order to maintain his balance
as a result he almost missed the swish of cloth sliding over cloth and then the faint twang that emanated from off to his right
he recoiled against the wall shoving roran back
at the same time something augered past his face carving a groove of flesh from his right cheek
the thin trench burned as if cauterized
red light bright as the midday sun flared into existence
it had no source and thus it illuminated every surface evenly and without shadows giving things a curious flat appearance
the sudden blaze dazzled eragon but it did more than that to the lone ra zac in front of him the creature dropped its bow covered its hooded face and screamed high and shrill
a similar screech told eragon that the second ra zac was behind them
eragon pivoted just in time to see roran charge the other ra zac hammer held high
the disoriented monster stumbled backward but was too slow
the hammer fell
for my ** shouted roran
he struck again
for our ** the ra zac was already dead but roran lifted the hammer once more
for ** his final blow shattered the ra zac is carapace like the rind of a dry gourd
in the merciless ruby glare the spreading pool of blood appeared purple
spinning his staff in a circle to knock aside the arrow or sword that he was convinced was driving toward him eragon turned to confront the remaining ra zac
the tunnel before them was empty
he swore
eragon strode over to the twisted figure on the floor
he swung the staff over his head and brought it down across the chest of the dead ra zac with a resounding thud
i ve waited a long time to do that said eragon
he and roran looked at each other
** cried eragon and clutched his cheek as the pain intensified
it is ** exclaimed roran
do **
the ra zac must have coated the arrowhead with seithr oil thought eragon
remembering his training he cleansed the wound and surrounding tissue with an incantation and then repaired the damage to his face
he opened and closed his mouth several times to make sure the muscles were working properly
with a grim smile he said imagine the state we d be in without magic
without magic we would not have galbatorix to worry about
talk later said saphira
as soon as those fishermen reach dras leona the king may hear of our doings from one of his pet spellcasters in the city and we do not want galbatorix scrying helgrind while we are still here
yes yes said eragon
extinguishing the omnipresent red glow he said brisingr raudhr and created a red werelight like that from the previous night except that this one remained anchored six inches from the ceiling instead of accompanying eragon wherever he went
now that he had an opportunity to examine the tunnel in some detail eragon saw that the stone hallway was dotted with twenty or so ironbound doors some on either side
he pointed and said ninth down on the right
you go get her
i will check the other cells
the ra zac might have left something interesting in them
