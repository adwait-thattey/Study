indeed despite the time several men were already moving through the gate
even though jeod had warned them it might happen roran still felt a surge of fear when the guards lowered their pikes and asked what their business was
he wet his mouth and tried not to fidget while the elder soldier examined a scroll that jeod handed to him
after a long minute the guard nodded and returned the parchment
you can pass
once they were on the wharf and out of earshot of the city wall jeod said it is a good thing he could not read
the six of them waited on the damp planking until one by one jeod is men emerged from the gray mist that lay upon the shore
they were grim and silent with braided hair that hung to the middle of their backs tar smeared hands and an assortment of scars even roran respected
he liked what he saw and he could tell they approved of him as well
they did not however take to birgit
one of the sailors a large brute of a man jerked a thumb at her and accused jeod you did not say there d be a woman along for the fightin
how am i supposed to concentrate with some backwoods tramp getting in m way
do not talk about her like that said nolfavrell between clenched teeth
in a calm voice jeod said birgit has fought the ra zac
and her son has already killed one of galbatorix is best soldiers
can you claim as much uthar
it is not proper said another man
i would not feel safe with a woman at my side they do naught but bring bad luck
a lady should not
whatever he was going to say was lost for at that instant birgit did a very unladylike thing
stepping forward she kicked uthar between his legs and then grabbed the second man and pressed her knife against his throat
she held him for a moment so everyone could see what she had done then released her captive
uthar rolled on the boards by her feet holding himself and muttering a stream of curses
does anyone else have an objection demanded birgit
beside her nolfavrell stared with openmouthed amazement at his mother
roran pulled his hood lower to conceal his ** thing they have not noticed gertrude he thought
when no one else challenged birgit jeod asked did you bring what i wanted each sailor reached inside his vest and divulged a weighted club and several lengths of rope
thus armed they worked their way down the harbor toward thedragon wing doing their best to escape detection
jeod kept his lantern shuttered the whole while
near the dock they hid behind a warehouse and watched the two lights carried by sentries bob around the deck of the ship
the gangway had been pulled away for the night
remember whispered jeod the most important thing is to keep the alarm from being sounded until we re ready to leave
two men above two men below right asked roran
uthar replied that be the custom
roran and uthar stripped to their breeches tied the rope and clubs around their waists roran left his hammer behind and then ran farther down the wharf out of the sentries sight where they lowered themselves into the frigid water
garr i hate when i have to do this said uthar
four times now
do not stop moving or you will freeze
clinging to the slimy piles underneath the wharf they swam back up the way they had come until they reached the stone pier that led to thedragon wing and then turned right
uthar put his lips to roran is ear
i will take the starboard ** roran nodded his agreement
they both dove under the black water and there they separated
uthar swam like a frog under the bow of the ship while roran went straight to the port anchor and clung to its thick chain
he untied the club from his waist and fit it between his teeth as much to stop them from chattering as to free his hands and prepared to wait
the rough metal sapped the warmth from his arms as fast as ice
not three minutes later roran heard the scuff of birgit is boots above him as she walked to the end of the pier opposite the middle of thedragon wing and then the faint sound of her voice as she engaged the sentries in conversation
hopefully she would keep their attention away from the bow
roran pulled himself hand over hand along the chain
