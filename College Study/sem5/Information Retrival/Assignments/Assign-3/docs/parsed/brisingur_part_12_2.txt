unable to muster the energy to flip the log again roran left the field and trotted through the surrounding maze of gray canvas tents waving to loring and fisk and others he recognized as well as a half dozen or so strangers who greeted him
hail ** they cried in warm tones
** he replied
it is a strange thing he thought to be known to people whom you have not met before
a minute later he arrived at the tent that had become his home and ducking inside stored away the bow the quiver of arrows and the short sword the varden had given him
he snared his waterskin from beside his bedding then hurried back into the bright sunlight and unstoppering the skin poured the contents over his back and shoulders
baths tended to be sporadic and infrequent events for roran but today was an important day and he wanted to be fresh and clean for what was to come
with the sharp edge of a polished stick he scraped the grime off his arms and legs and out from under his fingernails and then combed his hair and trimmed his beard
satisfied that he was presentable he pulled on his freshly washed tunic stuck his hammer through his belt and was about to head off through the camp when he became aware of birgit watching him from behind the corner of the tent
she clenched a sheathed dagger with both hands
roran froze ready to draw his hammer at the slightest provocation
he knew that he was in mortal danger and despite his prowess he was not confident of defeating birgit if she attacked for like him she pursued her enemies with single minded determination
you once asked me to help you said birgit and i agreed because i wanted to find the ra zac and kill them for eating my husband
have i not upheld my bargain
and do you remember i promised that once the ra zac were dead i would have my compensation from you for your role in quimby is death
birgit twisted the dagger with increasing urgency the back of her fists ridged with tendons
the dagger rose out of its sheath a full inch baring the bright steel and then slowly sank into darkness again
good she said
i would not want your memory to fail you
i will have my compensation garrowsson
never you doubt ** with a swift firm step she departed the dagger hidden among the folds of her dress
releasing his breath roran sat on a nearby stool and rubbed his throat convinced that he had narrowly escaped being gutted by birgit
her visit had alarmed him but it did not surprise him he had been aware of her intentions for months since before they left carvahall and he knew that one day he would have to settle his debt with her
a raven soared overhead and as he tracked it his mood lightened and he smiled
well he said to himself
a man rarely knows the day and hour when he will die
i could be killed at any moment and there is not a blasted thing i can do about it
what will happen will happen and i wo not waste the time i have aboveground worrying
misfortune always comes to those who wait
the trick is to find happiness in the brief gaps between disasters
birgit will do what her conscience tells her to and i will deal with it when i must
by his left foot he noticed a yellowish stone which he picked up and rolled between his fingers
concentrating on it as hard as he could he said stenr ** the stone ignored his command and remained immobile between his thumb and forefinger
with a snort he tossed it away
standing he strode north between the rows of tents
while he walked he tried to untangle a knot in the lacing at his collar but it resisted his efforts and he gave up on it when he arrived at horst is tent which was twice as large as most
hello in there he said and knocked on the pole between the two entrance flaps
katrina burst out of the tent copper hair flying and wrapped her arms around him
laughing he lifted her by the waist and spun her in a circle all the world a blur except her face then gently set her down
she pecked him on the lips once twice three times
growing still he gazed into her eyes more happy than he could ever remember being
how are you the only flaw in his joy was seeing how thin and pale imprisonment had left her
