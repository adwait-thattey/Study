the only advice i can give you is to avoid unnecessary risks
the varden cannot afford to lose ** with that he turned and left
eragon returned to orik and murtagh and hunkered next to saphira leaning his shield against his knees
the four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors around them
light from farthen dur is opening waned as the sun crept below the crater rim
eragon turned to scan the encampment and froze heart jolting
about thirty feet away sat arya with her bow in her lap
though he knew it was unreasonable he had hoped she might accompany the other women out of farthen dur
concerned he hastened to her
you will fight
i do what i must arya said calmly
her face darkened
do not pamper me human
elves train both their men and women to fight
i am not one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is danger
i was given the task of protecting saphira is egg
which i failed
my breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if i did not guard you and saphira on this field
you forget that i am stronger with magic than any here including you
if the shade comes who can defeat him but me and who else has the right
eragon stared at her helplessly knowing she was right and hating the fact
then stay ** out of desperation he added in the ancient language wiol pomnuria ** for my happiness
arya turned her gaze away uneasily the fringe of her hair obscuring her face
she ran a hand along her polished bow then murmured it is my wyrd to be here
the debt must be paid
he abruptly retreated to saphira
murtagh looked at him curiously
what did she say
wrapped in their own thoughts the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled by
farthen dur is crater again grew black except for the sanguine lantern glow and the fires heating the pitch
eragon alternated between myopically examining the links of his mail and spying on arya
orik repeatedly ran a whetstone over the blade of his ax periodically eyeing the edge between strokes the rasp of metal on stone was irritating
murtagh just stared into the distance
occasionally messengers ran through the encampment causing the warriors to surge to their feet
but it always proved to be a false alarm
the men and dwarves became strained angry voices were often heard
the worst part about farthen dur was the lack of wind the air was dead motionless
even when it grew warm and stifling and filled with smoke there was no reprieve
as the night dragged on the battlefield stilled silent as death
muscles stiffened from the waiting
eragon stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids
he shook himself to alertness and tried to focus through his stupor
finally orik said it is late
we should sleep
if anything happens the others will wake ** murtagh grumbled but eragon was too tired to complain
he curled up against saphira using his shield as a pillow
as his eyes closed he saw that arya was still awake watching over them
his dreams were confused and disturbing full of horned beasts and unseen menaces
over and over he heard a deep voice ask are you ready but he never had an answer
plagued by such visions his sleep was shallow and uneasy until something touched his arm
he woke with a start
it has begun arya said with a sorrowful expression
the troops in the encampment stood alertly with their weapons drawn
orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough room
arya nocked an arrow and held it ready to shoot
a scout ran out of a tunnel a few minutes ago said murtagh to eragon
the urgals are coming
together they watched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened stakes
a minute dragged by then another
and another
without taking his eyes from the tunnel eragon hoisted himself into saphira is saddle zar roc in his hand a comfortable weight
murtagh mounted tornac beside him
then a man cried i hear **
the warriors stiffened grips tightened on weapons
no one moved
no one breathed
somewhere a horse nickered
harsh urgal shouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnel is opening
at a command the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides pouring the scalding liquid into the tunnel is hungry throat
