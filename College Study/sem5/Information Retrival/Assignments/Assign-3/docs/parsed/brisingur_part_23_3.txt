the shield he hung from a neck spike
when the greaves were secure he slid his legs through the row of leather loops on either side of the saddle then tightened the slipknot on each loop
eragon is hand brushed against the belt of beloth the wise
he groaned remembering that he had emptied the belt while healing saphira in helgrind
** i should have stored some energy in it
he was just fitting on the bracers when saphira arched her wings cupping the air with the translucent membranes and reared stalling to a standstill as she alighted upon the crest of one of the embankments that ringed the camp
nasuada was already there sitting upon her massive charger battle storm
beside her was jormundur also mounted arya on foot and the current watch of the nighthawks led by khagra one of the urgals eragon had met on the burning plains
blodhgarm and the other elves emerged from the forest of tents behind them and stationed themselves close to eragon and saphira
from a different part of the camp galloped king orrin and his retinue reining in their prancing steeds as they drew near nasuada
close upon their heels came narheim chief of the dwarves and three of his warriors the group of them riding ponies clad with leather and mail armor
nar garzhvog ran out of the fields to the east the kull is thudding footsteps preceding his arrival by several seconds
nasuada shouted an order and the guards at the north entrance pulled aside the crude wooden gate to allow garzhvog inside the camp although if he had wanted the kull probably could have knocked open the gate by himself
who challenges growled garzhvog scaling the embankment with four inhumanly long strides
the horses shied away from the gigantic urgal
eragon was already studying their enemies
roughly two miles away five sleek boats black as pitch had landed upon the near bank of the jiet river
from the boats there issued a swarm of men garbed in the livery of galbatorix is army
the host glittered like wind whipped water under a summer sun as swords spears shields helmets and mail ringlets caught and reflected the light
arya shaded her eyes with a hand and squinted at the soldiers
i put their number between two hundred seventy and three hundred
king orrin scowled
galbatorix cannot be mad enough to believe he can destroy us with such a paltry ** orrin pulled off his helm which was in the shape of a crown and dabbed his brow with the corner of his tunic
we could obliterate that entire group and not lose a man
gnawing on the words garzhvog added the dragon king is a false tongued traitor a rogue ram but his mind is not feeble
he is cunning like a blood hungry weasel
the soldiers assembled themselves in orderly ranks and then began marching toward the varden
a messenger boy ran up to nasuada
she bent in her saddle to listen then dismissed him
nar garzhvog your people are safe within our camp
they are gathered near the east gate ready for you to lead them
garzhvog grunted but remained where he was
looking back at the approaching soldiers nasuada said i can think of no reason to engage them in the open
we can pick them off with archers once they are within range
and when they reach our breastwork they will break themselves against the trenches and the staves
not a single one will escape alive she concluded with evident satisfaction
when they have committed themselves said orrin my horsemen and i could ride out and attack them from the rear
they will be so surprised they will not even have a chance to defend themselves
the tide of battle may nasuada was replying when the brazen horn that had announced the arrival of the soldiers sounded once more so loudly that eragon arya and the rest of the elves covered their ears
eragon winced with pain from the blast
where is that coming from he asked saphira
a more important question i think is why the soldiers would want to warn us of their attack if they are indeed responsible for this baying
eragon forgot what he was going to say as he saw a stir of motion on the far side of the jiet river behind a veil of sorrowful willow trees
