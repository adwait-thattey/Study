it was not my intention for you to experience dagshelgr said arya
i apologize for my mistake
however though i am shielding you from this spell you cannot escape magic in du weldenvarden it permeates everything
so long as it does not befoul my ** orik shook his head and fingered the haft of his ax while eyeing the shadowy beasts that lumbered in the gloom beyond the pool of firelight
no one slept that night
eragon and orik remained awake because of the frightful din and the animals that kept crashing by their tents the elves because they still listened to the song
lifaen and nari took to pacing in endless circles while arya stared toward silthrim with a hungry expression her tawny skin drawn thin and taut over her cheekbones
four hours into the riot of sound and motion saphira dove out of the sky her eyes sparkling with a queer aspect
she shivered and arched her neck panting between her open ** forest she said is alive
and i am alive
my blood burns like never before
it burns as yours burns when you think of arya
i
understand
eragon put his hand on her shoulder feeling the tremors that racked her frame her sides vibrated as she hummed along with the music
she gripped the ground with her ivory claws her muscles coiled and clenched in a supreme effort to remain motionless
the tip of her tail twitched like she was about to pounce
arya stood and joined eragon on the opposite side of saphira
the elf also put a hand on saphira is shoulder and the three of them faced the darkness united into a living chain
when dawn broke the first thing eragon noticed was that all the trees now had buds of bright green needles at the ends of their branches
he bent and examined the snowberries at his feet and found that every plant large or small had acquired new growth during the night
the forest vibrated with the ripeness of its colors everything was lush and fresh and clean
the air smelled like it had just rained
saphira shook herself beside eragon and said the fever has passed i am myself again
such things i felt
it was as if the world were being born anew and i was helping to create it with the fire in my limbs
how are you on the inside i mean
i will need some time to understand what i experienced
since the music had ceased arya removed her spell from eragon and orik
she said lifaen
nari
go to silthrim and get horses for the five of us
we cannot walk all the way from here to ellesmera
also alert captain damitha that ceris requires reinforcements
nari bowed
and what shall we say when she asks why we have deserted our post
tell her that that which she once hoped for and feared has occurred the wyrm has bitten its own tail
she will understand
the two elves departed for silthrim after the boats were emptied of supplies
three hours later eragon heard a stick snap and looked up to see them returning through the forest on proud white stallions leading four other identical horses
the magnificent beasts moved among the trees with uncanny stealth their coats shimmering in the emerald twilight
none of them wore saddles or harnesses
blothr blothr murmured lifaen and his steed halted pawing the ground with its dark hooves
are all your horses as noble as these asked eragon
he cautiously approached one amazed by its beauty
the animals were only a few inches taller than ponies which made it easy for them to navigate among the closely placed trunks
they did not seem frightened by saphira
not all laughed nari tossing his silver hair but most
we have bred them for many centuries
how am i supposed to ride
arya said an elf horse responds instantly to commands in the ancient language tell it where you wish to go and it will take you
however do not mistreat them with blows or harsh words for they are not our slaves but our friends and partners
they bear you only so long as they consent to it is a great privilege to ride one
i was only able to save saphira is egg from durza because our horses sensed that something was amiss and stopped us from riding into his ambush
they wo not let you fall unless you deliberately throw yourself off and they are skilled in choosing the safest quickest path through treacherous ground
