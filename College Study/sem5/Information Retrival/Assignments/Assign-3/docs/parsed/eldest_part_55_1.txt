two hours later trianna returned leading a pair of warriors who carried a limp body between them
at trianna is word the men dropped the corpse on the floor
then the sorceress said we found the assassin where elva said we would
drail was his name
motivated by a morbid curiosity nasuada examined the face of the man who had tried to kill her
the assassin was short bearded and plain looking no different from countless other men in the city
she felt a certain connection to him as if his attempt on her life and the fact that she had arranged his death in return linked them in the most intimate manner possible
how was he killed she asked
i see no marks on his body
he committed suicide with magic when we overwhelmed his defenses and entered his mind but before we could take control of his actions
were you able to learn anything of use before he died
we were
drail was part of a network of agents based here in surda who are loyal to galbatorix
they are called the black hand
they spy on us sabotage our war efforts and best we could determine in our brief glimpse into drail is memories are responsible for dozens of murders throughout the varden
apparently they ve been waiting for a good chance to kill you ever since we arrived from farthen dur
why has not this black hand assassinated king orrin yet
trianna shrugged
i can not say
it may be that galbatorix considers you to be more of a threat than orrin
if that is the case then once the black hand realizes you are protected from their attacks here her gaze darted toward elva orrin wo not live another month unless he is guarded by magicians day and night
or perhaps galbatorix has abstained from such direct action because he wanted the black hand to remain unnoticed
surda has always existed at his tolerance
now that it is become a threat
can you protect orrin as well asked nasuada turning to elva
her violet eyes seemed to glow
maybe if he asks nicely
nasuada is thoughts raced as she considered how to thwart this new menace
can all of galbatorix is agents use magic
drail is mind was confused so it is hard to tell said trianna but i d guess a fair number of them can
magic cursed nasuada to herself
the greatest danger the varden faced from magicians or any person trained in the use of their mind was not assassination but rather espionage
magicians could spy on people is thoughts and glean information that could be used to destroy the varden
that was precisely why nasuada and the entire command structure of the varden had been taught to know when someone was touching their minds and how to shield themselves from such attentions
nasuada suspected that orrin and hrothgar relied upon similar precautions within their own governments
however since it was impractical for everyone privy to potentially damaging information to master that skill one of du vrangr gata is many responsibilities was to hunt for anyone who was siphoning off facts as they appeared in people is minds
the cost of such vigilance was that du vrangr gata ended up spying on the varden as much as on their enemies a fact that nasuada made sure to conceal from the bulk of her followers for it would only sow hatred distrust and dissent
she disliked the practice but saw no alternative
what she had learned about the black hand hardened nasuada is conviction that somehow magicians had to be governed
why she asked did not you discover this sooner i can understand that you might miss a lone assassin but an entire network of spellcasters dedicated to our destruction explain yourself trianna
the sorceress is eyes flashed with anger at the accusation
because here unlike in farthen dur we cannot examine everyone is minds for duplicity
there are just too many people for us magicians to keep track ** is why we did not know about the black hand until now lady nasuada
nasuada paused then inclined her head
understood
did you discover the identities of any other members of the black hand
good
use them to ferret out the rest of the agents
i want you to destroy this organization for me trianna
eradicate them as you would an infestation of vermin
