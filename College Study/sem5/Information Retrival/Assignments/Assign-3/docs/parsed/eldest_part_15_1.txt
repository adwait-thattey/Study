the dawnless morning found eragon in undin is main hall listening as the clan chief spoke to orik in dwarvish
undin broke off as eragon approached then said ah shadeslayer
you slept well
** he gestured at orik
we have been considering your departure
i had hoped you d be able to spend some time with us
but under the circumstances it seems best if you resume your journey early tomorrow morning when few are in the streets who might trouble you
supplies and transportation are being readied even as i speak
it was hrothgar is orders that guards should accompany you as far as ceris
i have increased their numbers from three to seven
undin shrugged his fur bound shoulders
i had intended to show you the wonders of tarnag but it would be foolish now for you to wander mine city
however grimstborith gannel has invited you to celbedeil for the day
accept if you wish
you will be safe with ** the clan chief seemed to have forgotten his earlier assertion that az sweldn rak anhuin would not harm a guest
thank you i might at ** as eragon left the hall he pulled orik aside and asked how serious is this feud really i need to know the truth
orik answered with obvious reluctance in the past it was not uncommon for blood feuds to endure for generations
entire families were driven extinct because of them
it was rash of az sweldn rak anhuin to invoke the old ways such a thing has not been done since the last of the clan wars
until they rescind their oath you must guard against their treachery whether it be for a year or a century
i am sorry that your friendship with hrothgar has brought this upon you eragon
but you are not alone
durgrimst ingeitum stands with you in this
once outside eragon hurried to saphira who had spent the night coiled in the ** you mind if i visit celbedeil
go if you must
but take zar ** followed her advice also tucking nasuada is scroll into his tunic
when eragon approached the gates to the hall is enclosure five dwarves pushed the rough hewn timbers aside then closed in around him hands on their axes and swords as they inspected the street
the guards remained as eragon retraced yesterday is path to the barred entrance of tarnag is foremost tier
eragon shivered
the city seemed unnaturally empty
doors were closed windows were shuttered and the few pedestrians in evidence averted their faces and turned down alleys to avoid walking past ** re scared to be seen near me he ** because they know az sweldn rak anhuin will retaliate against anyone who helps me
eager to escape the open street eragon raised his hand to knock but before he could one door grated outward and a black robed dwarf beckoned from within
tightening his sword belt eragon entered leaving his guards outside
his first impression was of color
a burning green sward splayed around the pillared mass of celbedeil like a mantle dropped over the symmetrical hill that upheld the temple
ivy strangled the building is ancient walls in foot after foot of hairy ropes dew still glittering on the pointed leaves
and curving above all but the mountains was the great white cupola ribbed with chiseled gold
his next impression was of smell
flowers and incense mixed their perfumes into an aroma so ethereal eragon felt as if he could live on the scent alone
last was sound for despite clumps of priests strolling along mosaic pathways and spacious grounds the only noise eragon could discern was the soft thump of a rook flying overhead
the dwarf beckoned again and strode down the main avenue toward celbedeil
as they passed under its eaves eragon could only marvel at the wealth and craftsmanship displayed around him
the walls were spotted with gems of every color and cut though all flawless and red gold had been hammered into the veins lacing the stone ceilings walls and floor
pearls and silver provided accents
occasionally they passed a screen partition carved entirely of jade
the temple was devoid of cloth decorations
in their absence the dwarves had carved a profusion of statues many depicting monsters and deities locked in epic battles
after climbing several floors they passed through a copper door waxy with verdigris and embossed with intricate patterned knots into a bare room floored with wood
