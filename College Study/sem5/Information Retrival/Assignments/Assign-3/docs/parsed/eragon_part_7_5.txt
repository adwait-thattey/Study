yes no sick animals to keep him back this year
eragon gestured at the two traders
who are they
grain buyers
they bought everyone is seed at ridiculously low prices and now they re telling wild stories expecting us to believe them
eragon understood why morn was so ** need that money
we can not get by without it
what kind of stories
morn snorted
they say the varden have formed a pact with the urgals and are massing an army to attack ** it is only through the grace of our king that we ve been protected for so long as if galbatorix would care if we burned to the ground
go listen to them
i have enough on my hands without explaining their lies
the first trader filled a chair with his enormous girth his every movement caused it to protest loudly
there was no hint of hair on his face his pudgy hands were baby smooth and he had pouting lips that curled petulantly as he sipped from a flagon
the second man had a florid face
the skin around his jaw was dry and corpulent filled with lumps of hard fat like cold butter gone rancid
contrasted with his neck and jowls the rest of his body was unnaturally thin
the first trader vainly tried to pull back his expanding borders to fit within the chair
he said no no you do not understand
it is only through the king is unceasing efforts on your behalf that you are able to argue with us in safety
if he in all his wisdom were to withdraw that support woe unto **
someone hollered right why do not you also tell us the riders have returned and you ve each killed a hundred elves
do you think we re children to believe in your tales we can take care of ** the group chuckled
the trader started to reply when his thin companion intervened with a wave of his hand
gaudy jewels flashed on his fingers
you misunderstand
we know the empire cannot care for each of us personally as you may want but it can keep urgals and other abominations from overrunning this he searched vaguely for the right term place
the trader continued you re angry with the empire for treating people unfairly a legitimate concern but a government cannot please everyone
there will inevitably be arguments and conflicts
however the majority of us have nothing to complain about
every country has some small group of malcontents who are not satisfied with the balance of power
yeah called a woman if you re willing to call the varden **
the fat man sighed
we already explained that the varden have no interest in helping you
that is only a falsehood perpetuated by the traitors in an attempt to disrupt the empire and convince us that the real threat is inside not outside our borders
all they want to do is overthrow the king and take possession of our land
they have spies everywhere as they prepare to invade
you never know who might be working for them
eragon did not agree but the traders words were smooth and people were nodding
he stepped forward and said how do you know this i can say that clouds are green but that does not mean it is true
prove you are not ** the two men glared at him while the villagers waited silently for the answer
the thin trader spoke first
he avoided eragon is eyes
are not your children taught respect or do you let boys challenge men whenever they want to
the listeners fidgeted and stared at eragon
then a man said answer the question
it is only common sense said the fat one sweat beading on his upper lip
his reply riled the villagers and the dispute resumed
eragon returned to the bar with a sour taste in his mouth
he had never before met anyone who favored the empire and tore down its enemies
there was a deep seated hatred of the empire in carvahall almost hereditary in nature
the empire never helped them during harsh years when they nearly starved and its tax collectors were heartless
he felt justified in disagreeing with the traders regarding the king is mercy but he did speculate about the varden
the varden were a rebel group that constantly raided and attacked the empire
it was a mystery who their leader was or who had formed them in the years following galbatorix is rise to power over a century ago
