did you kill it with your sling as well
i choked him to death with my hands
no weapons are allowed when you come of age and must prove your ** garzhvog paused for a moment his knife buried to the hilt in the carcass
most do not try to kill a cave bear
most hunt wolves or mountain goats
that is why i became war chief and others did not
eragon left him preparing the meat and went to the fire
next to it he dug a hole which he lined with the bear stomach pushing stakes through the metal rings to hold the stomach in place
he gathered a dozen apple sized rocks from the surrounding field and tossed them into the center of the fire
while he waited for the rocks to heat he used magic to fill the bear stomach two thirds with water and then he fashioned a pair of tongs out of a sapling willow and a piece of knotted rawhide
when the rocks were cherry red he shouted they re **
using the tongs eragon extracted the nearest stone from the fire and lowered it into the container
the surface of the water exploded into steam as the stone touched it
he deposited two more stones in the bear stomach which brought the water to a rolling boil
garzhvog lumbered over and poured a double handful of meat into the water then seasoned the stew with large pinches of salt from the pouch at his belt and several sprigs of rosemary thyme and other wild greens he had chanced upon while hunting
then he placed a flat piece of shale across one side of the fire
when the stone was hot he fried strips of meat on it
while the food cooked eragon and garzhvog carved themselves spoons from the stump where eragon had dropped his pack
hunger made it seem longer to eragon but it was not many more minutes before the stew was done and he and garzhvog ate ravenous as wolves
eragon devoured twice as much as he thought he ever had before and what he did not consume garzhvog did eating enough for six large men
afterward eragon lay back propping himself up on his elbows and stared at the flashing fireflies that had appeared along the edge of the beech trees swirling in abstract patterns as they chased one another
somewhere an owl hooted soft and throaty
the first few stars speckled the purple sky
eragon stared without seeing and thought of saphira and then of arya and then of arya and saphira and then he closed his eyes a dull throb forming behind his temples
he heard a cracking sound and opening his eyes once more saw that on the other side of the empty bear stomach garzhvog was cleaning his teeth with the pointed end of a broken thighbone
eragon dropped his gaze to the bottom of the urgal is bare feet garzhvog having removed his sandals before they began their meal and to his surprise noticed that the urgal had seven toes on each foot
the dwarves have the same number of toes as you do he said
garzhvog spat a piece of meat into the coals of the fire
i did not know that
i have never wanted to look at the feet of a dwarf
do not you find it curious that urgals and dwarves should both have fourteen toes while elves and humans have ten
garzhvog is thick lips lifted in a snarl
we share no blood with those hornless mountain rats firesword
they have fourteen toes and we have fourteen toes
it pleased the gods to shape us so when they created the world
there is no other explanation
eragon grunted in response and returned to watching the fireflies
then tell me a story your race is fond of nar garzhvog
the kull pondered for a moment then removed the bone from his mouth
he said long ago there lived a young urgralgra and her name was maghara
she had horns that shone like polished stone hair that hung past her waist and a laugh that could charm the birds out of the trees
but she was not pretty
she was ugly
now in her village there also lived a ram who was very strong
he had killed four rams in wrestling matches and had defeated twenty three others besides
but although his feats had won him wide renown he had yet to choose a brood mate
maghara wished to be his broodmate but he would not look at her for she was ugly and because of her ugliness he did not see her bright horns nor her long hair and he did not hear her pleasant laugh
