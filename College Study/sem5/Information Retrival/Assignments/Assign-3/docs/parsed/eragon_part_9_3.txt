i do not understand
where were we when the riders were created
we asked brom raising an eyebrow
you know all of ** eragon waved his hands vaguely
humans in general
brom laughed
we are no more native to this land than the elves
it took our ancestors another three centuries to arrive here and join the riders
that can not be protested eragon
we ve always lived in palancar valley
that might be true for a few generations but beyond that no
it is not even true for you eragon said brom gently
though you consider yourself part of garrow is family and rightly so your sire was not from here
ask around and you will find many people who have not been here that long
this valley is old and has not always belonged to us
eragon scowled and gulped at the tea
it was still hot enough to burn his throat
this was his home regardless of who his father ** what happened to the dwarves after the riders were destroyed
no one really knows
they fought with the riders through the first few battles but when it became clear galbatorix was going to win they sealed all the known entrances to their tunnels and disappeared underground
as far as i know not one has been seen since
and the dragons he asked
what of them surely they were not all killed
brom answered sorrowfully that is the greatest mystery in alagaesia nowadays how many dragons survived galbatorix is murderous slaughter he spared those who agreed to serve him but only the twisted dragons of the forsworn would assist his madness
if any dragons aside from shruikan are still alive they have hidden themselves so they will never be found by the empire
so wheredidmy dragon come from wondered eragon
were the urgals here when the elves came to alagaesia he asked
no they followed the elves across the sea like ticks seeking blood
they were one of the reasons the riders became valued for their battle prowess and ability to keep the peace
much can be learned from this history
it is a pity the king makes it a delicate subject reflected brom
yes i heard your story the last time i was in town
** roared brom
lightning flashed in his eyes
if it is a story then the rumors of my death are true and you are speaking with a ** respect the past you never know how it may affect you
eragon waited until brom is face mellowed before he dared ask how big were the dragons
a dark plume of smoke swirled above brom like a miniature thunderstorm
larger than a house
even the small ones had wingspans over a hundred feet they never stopped growing
some of the ancient ones before the empire killed them could have passed for large hills
dismay swept through ** can i hide my dragon in the years to come he raged silently but kept his voice calm
when did they mature
well said brom scratching his chin they could not breathe fire until they were around five to six months old which was about when they could mate
the older a dragon was the longer it could breathe fire
some of them could keep at it for ** brom blew a smoke ring and watched it float up to the ceiling
i heard that their scales shone like gems
brom leaned forward and growled you heard right
they came in every color and shade
it was said that a group of them looked like a living rainbow constantly shifting and shimmering
but who told you that
eragon froze for a second then lied a trader
what was his name asked brom
his tangled eyebrows met in a thick white line the wrinkles deepened on his forehead
unnoticed the pipe smoldered out
eragon pretended to think
i do not know
he was talking in morn is but i never found out who he was
i wish you had muttered brom
he also said a rider could hear his dragon is thoughts said eragon quickly hoping that the fictitious trader would protect him from suspicion
brom is eyes narrowed
slowly he took out a tinderbox and struck the flint
smoke rose and he took a long pull from the pipe exhaling slowly
in a flat voice he said he was wrong
it is not in any of the stories and i know them all
did he say anything else
eragon shrugged
** brom was too interested in the trader for him to continue the falsehood
casually he inquired did dragons live very long
