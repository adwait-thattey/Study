and if they have an end it will be when this world perishes for they suffer as the land does
they the dwarves and a few others are the true inhabitants of this land
they lived here before all others strong and proud in their elemental glory
their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on their silver ships
where did the elves come from interrupted eragon
and why are they called the fair folk do they really exist
brom scowled
do you want your original questions answered or not they wo not be if you want to explore every obscure piece of knowledge
sorry said eragon
he dipped his head and tried to look contrite
no you re not said brom with some amusement
he shifted his gaze to the fire and watched it lick the underside of the kettle
if you must know elves are not legends and they are called the fair folk because they are more graceful than any of the other races
they come from what they call alalea though none but they know what or even where it is
now he glared from under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more interruptions the elves were a proud race then and strong in magic
at first they regarded dragons as mere animals
from that belief rose a deadly mistake
a brash elven youth hunted down a dragon as he would a stag and killed it
outraged the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf
unfortunately the bloodletting did not stop there
the dragons massed together and attacked the entire elven nation
dismayed by the terrible misunderstanding the elves tried to end the hostilities but could not find a way to communicate with the dragons
thus to greatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences there was a very long and very bloody war which both sides later regretted
at the beginning the elves fought only to defend themselves for they were reluctant to escalate the fighting but the dragons ferocity eventually forced them to attack for their own survival
this lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer if an elf called eragon had not found a dragon ** eragon blinked in surprise
ah i see you did not know of your namesake said brom
** the teakettle whistled ** was i named after an elf
then you should find this all the more interesting said brom
he hooked the kettle out of the fire and poured boiling water into two cups
handing one to eragon he warned these leaves do not need to steep long so drink it quickly before it gets too ** eragon tried a sip but scalded his tongue
brom set his own cup aside and continued smoking the pipe
no one knows why that egg was abandoned
some say the parents were killed in an elven attack
others believe the dragons purposefully left it there
either way eragon saw the value of raising a friendly dragon
he cared for it secretly and in the custom of the ancient language named him bid daum
when bid daum had grown to a good size they traveled together among the dragons and convinced them to live in peace with the elves
treaties were formed between the two races
to ensure that war would never break out again they decided that it was necessary to establish the riders
at first the riders were intended merely as a means of communication between the elves and dragons
however as time passed their worth was recognized and they were given ever more authority
eventually they took the island vroengard for their home and built a city on it doru areaba
before galbatorix overthrew them the riders held more power than all the kings in alagaesia
now i believe i have answered two of your questions
yes said eragon absently
it seemed like an incredible coincidence that he had been named after the first rider
for some reason his name did not feel the same anymore
what doeseragon mean
i do not know said brom
it is very old
i doubt anyone remembers except the elves and fortune would have to smile greatly before you talked with one
it is a good name to have though you should be proud of it
not everyone has one so honorable
eragon brushed the matter from his mind and focused on what he had learned from brom there was something missing
