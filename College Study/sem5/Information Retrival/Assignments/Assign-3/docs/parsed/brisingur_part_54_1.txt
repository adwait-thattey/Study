eragon bolted upright throwing off his blankets as easily as he cast off his waking dreams
his arms and shoulders were sore from his exertions of the previous day
he pulled on his boots fumbling with the laces in his excitement grabbed his grimy apron from the floor and bounded down the elaborately carved stairs to the entryway of rhunon is curved house
outside the sky was bright with the first light of dawn although shadow still enveloped the atrium
eragon spotted rhunon and saphira by the open walled forge and trotted over to them combing his hair into place with his fingers
rhunon stood leaning against the edge of the bench
there were dark bags under her eyes and the lines on her face were heavier than before
the sword lay before her concealed beneath a length of white cloth
i have done the impossible she said the words hoarse and broken
i made a sword when i swore i would not
what is more i made it in less than a day and with hands that were not my own
yet the sword is not crude or shoddy
** it is the finest sword i have ever forged
i would have preferred to use less magic during the process but that is my only qualm and it is a small one compared with the perfection of the results
**
grasping the corner of the cloth rhunon pulled it aside revealing the sword
he had thought that in the handful of hours since he had left her rhunon would only have had enough time to fabricate a plain hilt and crossguard for the sword and maybe a simple wooden scabbard
instead the sword eragon saw on the bench was as magnificent as zar roc naegling and tamerlein and in his opinion more beautiful than any of them
covering the blade was a glossy scabbard of the same dark blue as the scales on saphira is back
the color displayed a slight variegation like the mottled light at the bottom of a clear forest pond
a piece of blued brightsteel carved in the shape of a leaf capped the end of the scabbard while a collar decorated with stylized vines encircled the mouth
the curved crossguard was also made of blued brightsteel as were the four ribs that held in place the large sapphire that formed the pommel
the hand and a half hilt was made of hard black wood
overcome by a sense of reverence eragon reached out toward the sword then paused and glanced at rhunon
may i he asked
she inclined her head
you may
i give it to thee shadeslayer
eragon lifted the sword from the bench
the scabbard and the wood of the hilt were cool to the touch
for several minutes he marveled at the details on the scabbard and the guard and the pommel
then he tightened his grip around the hilt and unsheathed the blade
like the rest of the sword the blade was blue but of a slightly lighter shade it was the blue of the scales in the hollow of saphira is throat rather than the blue of those on her back
and as it was on zar roc the color was iridescent as eragon moved the sword about the color would shimmer and shift displaying any of the many tones of blue present on saphira herself
through the wash of color the cable like patterns within the brightsteel and the pale bands along the edges were still visible
with a single hand eragon swung the sword through the air and he laughed at how light and fast it felt
the sword almost seemed alive
he grasped the sword with both his hands then and was delighted to find that they fit perfectly on the longer hilt
lunging forward he stabbed at an imaginary enemy and was confident they would have died from the attack
here said rhunon and pointed at a bundle of three iron rods planted upright in the ground outside the forge
try it on those
eragon allowed himself a moment to focus his thoughts then took a single step toward the rods
with a yell he slashed downward and cut through all three rods
the blade emitted a single pure note that slowly faded into silence
when eragon examined the edge where it had struck the iron he saw that the impact had not damaged it in the slightest
are you well pleased dragon rider rhunon asked
more than pleased rhunon elda said eragon and bowed to her
i do not know how i can thank you for such a gift
