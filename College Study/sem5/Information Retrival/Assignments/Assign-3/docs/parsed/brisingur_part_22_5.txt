a red eagle screeched at them as it flew past
saphira is flapping became labored and eragon began to feel light headed
stilling her wings saphira glided from one thermal to the next maintaining her altitude but ascending no farther
eragon looked down
they were so high height had ceased to matter and things on the ground no longer seemed real
the varden is camp was an irregularly shaped playing board covered with tiny gray and black rectangles
the jiet river was a silver rope fringed with green tassels
to the south the sulfurous clouds rising from the burning plains formed a range of glowing orange mountains home to shadowy monsters that flickered in and out of existence
eragon quickly averted his gaze
for perhaps half an hour he and saphira drifted with the wind relaxing in the silent comfort of each other is company
an inaudible spell served to insulate eragon from the chill
at last they were alone together alone as they had been in palancar valley before the empire had intruded upon their life
saphira was the first to speak
we are the rulers of the sky
here at the ceiling of the world
eragon reached up as if from where he sat he could brush the stars
banking to the left saphira caught a gust of warmer air from below then leveled off again
you will marry roran and katrina tomorrow
what a strange thought that is
strange roran should marry and strange i should be the one to perform the ceremony
roran married
thinking about it makes me feel older
even we who were boys but a short while ago cannot escape the inexorable progress of time
so the generations pass and soon it will be our turn to send our children out into the land to do the work that needs to be done
but not unless we can survive the next few months
saphira wobbled as turbulence buffeted them
then she looked back at him and asked ready
tilting forward she pulled her wings close against her sides and plummeted toward the ground faster than a speeding arrow
eragon laughed as the sensation of weightlessness overtook him
he tightened his legs around saphira to keep himself from drifting away from her then overtaken by a surge of recklessness released his grip and held his hands over his head
the disk of land below spun like a wheel as saphira augered through the air
slowing and then stopping her rotation she rolled to the right until she was falling upside down
** cried eragon and pounded her shoulder
a ribbon of smoke streaming from her nostrils she righted herself and again pointed herself at the fast approaching ground
eragon is ears popped and he worked his jaw as the pressure increased
less than a thousand feet above the varden is camp and only a few seconds from crashing into the tents and excavating a large and bloody crater saphira allowed the wind to catch her wings
the subsequent jolt threw eragon forward and the spike he had been holding nearly stabbed him in the eye
with three powerful flaps saphira brought them to a complete halt
locking her wings outstretched she then began to gently circle downward
now that was ** exclaimed eragon
there is no more exciting sport than flying for if you lose you die
ah but i have complete confidence in your abilities you would never run us into the ground
her pleasure at his compliment radiated from her
angling toward his tent she shook her head jostling him and said i ought to be accustomed to it by now but every time i come out of a dive like that it makes my chest and wing arms so sore the next morning i can barely move
he patted her
well you should not have to fly tomorrow
the wedding is our only obligation and you can walk to it
she grunted and landed amid a billow of dust knocking over an empty tent with her tail in the process
dismounting eragon left her grooming herself with six of the elves standing nearby and with the other six he trotted through the camp until he located the healer gertrude
from her he learned the marriage rites he would need the following day and he practiced them with her that he might avoid an embarrassing blunder when the moment arrived
then eragon returned to his tent and washed his face and changed his clothes before going with saphira to dine with king orrin and his entourage as promised
