since the urgals have access to the tunnels we cannot risk an extended battle
as long as they are here we will be in constant danger of them quarrying up through tronjheim is floor
if that happens we will be trapped attacked from both the outside and inside
we have to prevent the urgals from taking tronjheim
if they secure it it is doubtful we will have the strength to roust them
and what of our families asked jormundur
i wo not see my wife and son murdered by urgals
the lines deepened on ajihad is face
all the women and children are being evacuated into the surrounding valleys
if we are defeated they have guides who will take them to surda
that is all i can do under the circumstances
jormundur struggled to hide his relief
sir is nasuada going as well
she is not pleased but ** all eyes were on ajihad as he squared his shoulders and announced the urgals will arrive in a matter of hours
we know their numbers are great but wemust hold farthen dur
failure will mean the dwarves downfall death to the varden and eventual defeat for surda and the elves
this is one battle we cannot lose
now go and complete your ** jormundur ready the men to fight
they left the study and scattered jormundur to the barracks orik and arya to the stairs leading underground and eragon and saphira down one of tronjheim is four main halls
despite the early hour the city mountain swarmed like an anthill
people were running shouting messages and carrying bundles of belongings
eragon had fought and killed before but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear into his chest
he had never had a chance to anticipate a fight
now that he did it filled him with dread
he was confident when facing only a few opponents he knew he could easily defeat three or four urgals with zar roc and magic but in a large conflict anything could happen
they exited tronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help
without the sun or moon the inside of farthen dur was dark as lampblack punctuated by glittering lanterns bobbing jerkily in the ** they re on the far side of tronjheim suggested saphira
eragon agreed and swung onto her back
they glided around tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight
saphira angled toward them then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled dwarves who were busy digging with pickaxes
eragon quickly explained why he was there
a sharp nosed dwarf told him there is a tunnel about four yards directly underneath us
any help you could give us would be appreciated
if you clear the area over the tunnel i will see what i can ** the sharp nosed dwarf looked doubtful but ordered the diggers off the site
breathing slowly eragon prepared to use magic
it might be possible to actually move all the dirt off the tunnel but he needed to conserve his strength for later
instead he would try to collapse the tunnel by applying force to weak sections of its ceiling
thrysta deloi he whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil
almost immediately they encountered rock
he ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the hollow emptiness of the tunnel
then he began searching for flaws in the rock
every time he found one he pushed on it elongating and widening it
it was strenuous work but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand
he made no visible progress a fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves
eragon persevered
before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be heard clearly on the surface
there was a persistent screech then the ground slid inward like water draining from a tub leaving a gaping hole seven yards across
as the delighted dwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble the sharp nosed dwarf led eragon to the next tunnel
this one was much more difficult to collapse but he managed to duplicate the feat
over the next few hours he collapsed over a half dozen tunnels throughout farthen dur with saphira is help
light crept into the small patch of sky above them as he worked
it was not enough to see by but it bolstered eragon is confidence
