roran had only succeeded as he later explained because the strength of his passion drove him to extremes that others feared and avoided and thus allowed him to confound his enemies
a similar fervor now gripped eragon
he would leap into harm is way without the slightest regard for his own safety if someone he cared for was in danger
he loved roran as a brother and since roran was to marry katrina eragon had extended his definition of family to include her as well
this concept seemed even more important because eragon and roran were the last heirs of their line
eragon had renounced all affiliation with his birth brother murtagh and the only relatives he and roran had left were each other and now katrina
noble sentiments of kinship were not the only force that drove the pair
another goal obsessed them as well ** even as they plotted to snatch katrina from the grasp of the ra zac so the two warriors mortal man and dragon rider alike sought to slay king galbatorix is unnatural servants for torturing and murdering garrow who was roran is father and had been as a father to eragon
the intelligence then that eragon had gleaned was as important to him as to roran
i think i felt her he said
it is hard to be certain because we re so far from helgrind and i ve never touched her mind before but i think she is in that forsaken peak concealed somewhere near the very top
is she sick is she injured blast it eragon do not hide it from me have they hurt her
she is in no pain at the moment
more than that i cannot say for it required all my strength just to make out the glow of her consciousness i could not communicate with ** eragon refrained from mentioning however that he had detected a second person as well one whose identity he suspected and the presence of whom if confirmed troubled him greatly
what i did not find were the ra zac or the lethrblaka
even if i somehow overlooked the ra zac their parents are so large their life force should blaze like a thousand lanterns even as saphira is does
aside from katrina and a few other dim specks of light helgrind is black black black
roran scowled clenched his left fist and glared at the mountain of rock which was fading into the dusk as purple shadows enveloped it
in a low flat voice as if talking with himself he said it does not matter whether you are right or wrong
we dare not attack tonight night is when the ra zac are strongest and if they are nearby it would be stupid to fight them when we re at a disadvantage
agreed
so we wait for the ** roran gestured toward the slaves chained to the gory altar
if those poor wretches are gone by then we know the ra zac are here and we proceed as planned
if not we curse our bad luck that they escaped us free the slaves rescue katrina and fly back to the varden with her before murtagh hunts us down
either way i doubt the ra zac will leave katrina unattended for long not if galbatorix wants her to survive so he can use her as a tool against me
eragon nodded
he wanted to release the slaves now but doing so could warn their foes that something was amiss
nor if the ra zac came to collect their dinner could he and saphira intercede before the slaves were ferried away
a battle in the open between a dragon and creatures such as the lethrblaka would attract the attention of every man woman and child for leagues around
and eragon did not think he saphira or roran could survive if galbatorix learned they were alone in his empire
he looked away from the shackled men
for their sake i hope the ra zac are on the other side of alagaesia or at least that the ra zac are not hungry tonight
by unspoken consent eragon and roran crawled backward down from the crest of the low hill they were hiding behind
at the bottom they rose into a half crouch then turned and still doubled over ran between two rows of hills
the shallow depression gradually deepened into a narrow flood carved gully lined with crumbling slabs of shale
dodging the gnarled juniper trees that dotted the gully eragon glanced up and through clumps of needles saw the first constellations to adorn the velvet sky
