he is a magnificent beast said eragon admiringly
murtagh laughed
yes but snowfire is as close to his match as i ve ever seen
they covered only a short distance that day yet eragon was glad to be on the move again
it kept his mind off other more morbid matters
they were riding through unsettled land
the road to dras leona was several leagues to their left
they would skirt the city by a wide margin on the way to gil ead which was almost as far to the north as carvahall
they sold cadoc in a small village
as the horse was led away by his new owner eragon regretfully pocketed the few coins he had gained from the transaction
it was difficult to relinquish cadoc after crossing half of alagaesia and outracing urgals on him
the days rolled by unnoticed as their small group traveled in isolation
eragon was pleased to find that he and murtagh shared many of the same interests they spent hours debating the finer points of archery and hunting
there was one subject however they avoided discussing by unspoken consent their pasts
eragon did not explain how he had found saphira met brom or where he came from
murtagh was likewise mute as to why the empire was chasing him
it was a simple arrangement but it worked
yet because of their proximity it was inevitable that they learned about each other
eragon was intrigued by murtagh is familiarity with the power struggles and politics within the empire
he seemed to know what every noble and courtier was doing and how it affected everyone else
eragon listened carefully suspicions whirling through his mind
the first week went by without any sign of the ra zac which allayed some of eragon is fears
even so they still kept watches at night
eragon had expected to encounter urgals on the way to gil ead but they found no trace of ** thought these remote places would be teeming with monsters he ** i am not one to complain if they ve gone elsewhere
he dreamed of the woman no more
and though he tried to scry her he saw only an empty cell
whenever they passed a town or city he checked to see if it had a jail
if it did he would disguise himself and visit it but she was not to be found
his disguises became increasingly elaborate as he saw notices featuring his name and description and offering a substantial reward for his capture posted in various towns
their travels north forced them toward the capital uru baen
it was a heavily populated area which made it difficult to escape notice
soldiers patrolled the roads and guarded the bridges
it took them several tense irritable days to skirt the capital
once they were safely past uru baen they found themselves on the edge of a vast plain
it was the same one that eragon had crossed after leaving palancar valley except now he was on the opposite side
they kept to the perimeter of the plain and continued north following the ramr river
eragon is sixteenth birthday came and went during this time
at carvahall a celebration would have been held for his entrance into manhood but in the wilderness he did not even mention it to murtagh
at nearly six months of age saphira was much larger
her wings were massive every inch of them was needed to lift her muscular body and thick bones
the fangs that jutted from her jaw were nearly as thick around as eragon is fist their points as sharp as zar roc
the day finally came when eragon unwrapped his side for the last time
his ribs had healed completely leaving him with only a small scar where the ra zac is boot had cut his side
as saphira watched he stretched slowly then with increasing vigor when there was no pain
he flexed his muscles pleased
in an earlier time he would have smiled but after brom is death such expressions did not come easily
he tugged his tunic on and walked back to the small fire they had made
murtagh sat next to it whittling a piece of wood
eragon drew zar roc
murtagh tensed though his face remained calm
now that i am strong enough would you like to spar asked eragon
murtagh tossed the wood to the side
with sharpened swords we could kill each other
here give me your sword said eragon
