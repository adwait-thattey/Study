inscribed on that paper are nine wards i want you to place about yourself and the dwarf orik
as you discovered at silthrim our festivities are potent and not for those with constitutions weaker than ours
unprotected you risk losing yourself in the web of our magic
i have seen it happen
even with these precautions you must take care you are not swayed by fancies wafted on the breeze
be on your guard for during this time we elves are apt to go mad wonderfully gloriously mad but mad all the same
on the eve of the agaeti blodhren which was to last three days eragon saphira and orik accompanied arya to the menoa tree where a host of elves were assembled their black and silver hair flickering in the lamplight
islanzadi stood upon a raised root at the base of the trunk as tall pale and fair as a birch tree
blagden roosted on the queen is left shoulder while maud the werecat lurked behind her
glaedr was there as well as oromis garbed in red and black and other elves eragon recognized such as lifaen and nari and to his distaste vanir
overhead the stars glittered in the velvet sky
wait here said arya
she slipped through the crowd and returned leading rhunon
the smith blinked like an owl at her surroundings
eragon greeted her and she nodded to him and saphira
well met brightscales and ** then she spied orik and addressed him in dwarvish to which orik replied with enthusiasm obviously delighted to converse with someone in the rough speech of his native land
what did she say asked eragon bending down
she invited me to her home to view her work and discuss metal ** awe crossed orik is face
eragon she first learned her craft from futhark himself one of the legendary grimstborithn of durgrimst ** what i would give to have met him
together they waited until the stroke of midnight when islanzadi raised her bare left arm so that it pointed toward the new moon like a marble spear
a soft white orb gathered itself above her palm from the light emitted by the lanterns that dotted the menoa tree
then islanzadi walked along the root to the massive trunk and placed the orb in a hollow in the bark where it remained pulsing
eragon turned to arya
is it begun
it is ** she laughed
and it will end when the werelight expends itself
the elves divided themselves into informal camps throughout the forest and clearing that encircled the menoa tree
seemingly out of nowhere they produced tables laden high with fantastic dishes which from their unearthly appearance were as much the result of the spellweavers handiwork as the cooks
then the elves began to sing in their clear flutelike voices
they sang many songs yet each was but part of a larger melody that wove an enchantment over the dreamy night heightening senses removing inhibitions and burnishing the revels with fey magic
their verses concerned heroic deeds and quests by ship and horse to forgotten lands and the sorrow of lost beauty
the throbbing music enveloped eragon and he felt a wild abandon take hold of him a desire to run free of his life and dance through elven glades forever more
beside him saphira hummed along with the tune her glazed eyes lidded halfway
what transpired afterward eragon was never able to adequately recall
it was as if he had a fever and faded in and out of consciousness
he could remember certain incidents with vivid clarity bright pungent flashes filled with merriment but it was beyond him to reconstruct the order in which they occurred
he lost track of whether it was day or night for no matter the time dusk seemed to pervade the forest
nor could he ever say if he had slumbered or needed sleep during the celebration
he remembered spinning in circles while holding the hands of an elf maid with cherry lips the taste of honey on his tongue and the smell of juniper in the air
he remembered elves perched on the outstretched branches of the menoa tree like a flock of starlings
they strummed golden harps and called riddles to glaedr below and now and then pointed a finger at the sky whereupon a burst of colored embers would appear in various shapes before fading away
