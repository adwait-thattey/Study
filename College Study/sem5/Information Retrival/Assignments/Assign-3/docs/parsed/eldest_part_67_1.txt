murtagh grinned
then he said thrysta vindr and a hard ball of air coalesced between them and struck eragon in the middle of his chest tossing him twenty feet across the plateau
eragon heard saphira growl as he landed on his back
his vision flashed red and white then he curled into a ball and waited for the pain to recede
any delight he felt in murtagh is reappearance was overwhelmed by the macabre circumstances of their meeting
a unstable mixture of shock confusion and anger boiled within him
lowering his sword murtagh pointed at eragon with his steel encased hand curling every finger but his index into a spiny fist
you never would give up
a chill crept along eragon is spine for he recognized the scene from his premonition while rafting the az ragni to hedarth a man sprawled in the clotted mud with a dented helm and bloody mail his face concealed behind an upthrown arm
an armored hand entered eragon is view and pointed at the downed man with all the authority of fate itself
past and future had converged
now eragon is doom would be decided
pushing himself to his feet he coughed and said murtagh
how can you be alive i watched the urgals drag you underground
i tried to scry you but saw only darkness
murtagh uttered a mirthless laugh
you saw nothing just as i saw nothing the times i tried to scry you during my days in uru baen
youdied ** shouted eragon almost incoherent
you died under farthen dur
arya found your bloody clothes in the tunnels
a shadow darkened murtagh is face
no i did not die
it was the twins doing eragon
they took control of a group of urgals and arranged the ambush in order to kill ajihad and capture me
then they ensorcelled me so i could not escape and spirited me off to uru baen
eragon shook his head unable to comprehend what had happened
but why did you agree to serve galbatorix you told me you hated him
you told me
** murtagh laughed again and this time his outburst contained an edge of madness
i did notagree
first galbatorix punished me for spiting his years of protection during my upbringing in uru baen for defying his will and running away
then he extracted everything i knew about you saphira and the varden
you betrayed ** i was mourning you and you betrayed **
ajihad was right to lock you up
he should have let you rot in your cell then none of this
i had no ** snarled murtagh
and after thorn hatched for me galbatorix forced both of us to swear loyalty to him in the ancient language
we cannot disobey him now
pity and disgust welled inside of eragon
you have become your father
a strange gleam leaped into murtagh is eyes
no not my father
i am stronger than morzan ever was
galbatorix taught me things about magic you ve never even dreamed of
spells so powerful the elves dare not utter them cowards that they are
words in the ancient language that were lost until galbatorix discovered them
ways to manipulate energy
secrets terrible secrets that can destroy your enemies and fulfill all your desires
eragon thought back to some of oromis is lessons and retorted things that should remain secrets
if you knew you would not say that
brom was a dabbler nothing more
and the elves ** all they can do is hide in their forest and wait to be ** murtagh ran his eyes over eragon
you look like an elf now
did islanzadi do that to you when eragon remained silent murtagh smiled and shrugged
no matter
i will learn the truth soon ** he stopped frowned then looked to the east
following his gaze eragon saw the twins standing at the front of the empire casting balls of energy into the midst of the varden and the dwarves
the curtains of smoke made it difficult to tell but eragon was sure the hairless magicians were grinning and laughing as they slaughtered the men with whom they once pledged solemn friendship
what the twins failed to notice and what was clearly visible to eragon and murtagh from their vantage point was that roran was crawling toward them from the side
eragon is heart skipped a beat as he recognized his ** ** get away from ** you will be killed
just as he opened his mouth to cast a spell that would transport roran out of danger no matter the cost murtagh said wait
