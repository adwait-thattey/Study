roran and eragon parted at the outskirts of carvahall
eragon walked slowly to brom is house engrossed in his thoughts
he stopped at the doorstep and raised his hand to knock
a voice rasped what do you want boy
he whirled around
behind him brom leaned on a twisted staff embellished with strange carvings
he wore a brown hooded robe like a friar
a pouch hung from the scuffed leather belt clasped around his waist
above his white beard a proud eagle nose hooked over his mouth and dominated his face
he peered at eragon with deep set eyes shadowed by a gnarled brow and waited for his reply
to get information eragon said
roran is getting a chisel fixed and i had free time so i came to see if you could answer a few questions
the old man grunted and reached for the door
eragon noticed a gold ring on his right hand
light glinted off a sapphire highlighting a strange symbol carved on its face
you might as well come in we will be talking awhile
your questions never seem to ** inside the house was darker than charcoal an acrid smell heavy in the air
now for a ** eragon heard the old man move around then a low curse as something crashed to the floor
ah here we ** a white spark flashed a flame wavered into existence
brom stood with a candle before a stone fireplace
stacks of books surrounded a high backed deeply carved wooden chair that faced the mantel the four legs were shaped like eagle claws and the seat and back were padded with leather embossed with a swirling rose pattern
a cluster of lesser chairs held piles of scrolls
ink pots and pens were scattered across a writing desk
make room for yourself but by the lost kings becareful
this stuff is valuable
eragon stepped over pages of parchment covered with angular runes
he gently lifted cracking scrolls off a chair and placed them on the floor
a cloud of dust flew into the air as he sat
he stifled a sneeze
brom bent down and lit the fire with his candle
** nothing like sitting by a fire for ** he threw back his hood to reveal hair that was not white but silver then hung a kettle over the flames and settled into the high backed chair
now what do you want he addressed eragon roughly but not unkindly
well said eragon wondering how best to approach the subject i keep hearing about the dragon riders and their supposed accomplishments
most everyone seems to want them to return but i ve never heard tell of how they were started where the dragons came from or what made the riders special aside from the dragons
a vast subject to tell about grumbled brom
he peered at eragon alertly
if i told you their whole story we would still be sitting here when winter comes again
it will have to be reduced to a manageable length
but before we start properly i need my pipe
eragon waited patiently as brom tamped down the tobacco
he liked brom
the old man was irascible at times but he never seemed to mind taking time for eragon
eragon had once asked him where he came from and brom had laughed saying a village much like carvahall only not quite as ** curiosity aroused eragon asked his uncle
but garrow could only tell him that brom had bought a house in carvahall nearly fifteen years ago and had lived there quietly ever since
brom used a tinderbox to light the pipe
he puffed a few times then said there
we wo not have to stop except for the tea
now about the riders or the shur tugal as they are called by the elves
where to start they spanned countless years and at the height of their power held sway over twice the empire is lands
numerous stories have been told about them most nonsense
if you believed everything said you would expect them to have the powers of a lesser god
scholars have devoted entire lives to separating these fictions from fact but it is doubtful any of them will succeed
however it is not an impossible task if we confine ourselves to the three areas you specified how the riders began why they were so highly regarded and where dragons came from
i shall start with the last ** eragon settled back and listened to the man is mesmerizing voice
dragons have no beginning unless it lies with the creation of alagaesia itself
