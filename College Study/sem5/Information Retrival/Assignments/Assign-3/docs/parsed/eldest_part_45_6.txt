you wrong me replied roran
i did not lie this is my flock and i am their shepherd
is it not within my right to call them livestock if i want
call them what you will i did not agree to haul people to ** you did not tell me the true nature of your cargo i might wonder an the only answer on the horizon is that whatever venture you re engaged in means trouble
trouble for you an trouble for me
i should toss the lot of you overboard an return to narda
but you wo not said roran deadly quiet
because i need these barges clovis and i will do anything to keep them
anything
honor our bargain and you will have a peaceful trip and you will get to see galina again
if not
the threat sounded worse than it was roran had no intention of killing clovis though if he had to he would abandon him somewhere along the coast
clovis is face reddened but he surprised roran by grunting and saying fair enough ** pleased with himself roran returned his attention to the beach
acting on instinct roran recoiled crouching twisting and covering his head with his shield
his arm vibrated as a belaying pin broke across the shield
he lowered the shield and gazed at a dismayed clovis who retreated across the deck
roran shook his head never taking his eyes off his opponent
you can not defeat me clovis
i will ask you again will you honor our bargain if you do not i will put you ashore commandeer the barges and press your crew into service
i do not want to ruin your livelihood but i will if you force me
come now
this can be a normal uneventful voyage if you choose to help us
remember you ve already been paid
drawing himself up with great dignity clovis said if i agree then you must do me the courtesy of explaining why this ruse were necessary an why these people are here an where they re from
no matter how much gold you offer me i wo not assist an undertaking that contradicts my principles no i wo not
are you bandits or do you serve the blasted king
the knowledge may place you in greater danger
have you heard of carvahall in palancar valley asked roran
clovis waved a hand
once or twice
what of it
you see it now on the beach
galbatorix is soldiers attacked us without provocation
we fought back and when our position became untenable we crossed the spine and followed the coast to narda
galbatorix has promised that every man woman and child from carvahall will be killed or enslaved
reaching surda is our only hope of ** roran left out mention of the ra zac he did not want to frighten clovis too badly
the weathered seaman had gone gray
are you still pursued
aye but the empire has yet to discover us
an are you why the alarm was sounded
very softly roran said i killed two soldiers who recognized ** the revelation startled clovis his eyes widened he stepped back and the muscles in his forearms rippled as he clenched his fists
make your choice clovis the shore draws near
he knew he had won when the captain is shoulders drooped and the bravado faded from his bearing
ah the plague take you stronghammer
i am no friend of the king i will get you to teirm
but then i want nothing more to do with you
will you give me your word that you wo not attempt to slip away in the night or any similar deception
sand and rocks grated across the bottom of thered boar is hull as the barge drove itself up onto the beach followed on either side by its two companions
the relentless rhythmic surge of water dashing itself against the land sounded like the breathing of a gigantic monster
once the sails were furled and the gangplanks extended torson and flint both strode over to thered boar and accosted clovis demanding to know what was going on
there is been a change of plans said clovis
roran left him to explain the situation skirting the exact reasons why the villagers left palancar valley and jumped onto the sand whereupon he set out to find horst among the milling knots of people
when he spotted the smith roran pulled him aside and told him about the deaths in narda
if it is discovered that i left with clovis they may send soldiers on horses after us
we have to get everyone onto the barges as fast as possible
