eragon entered the pavilion saphira pushing her head through after him
he was met by a steely rasp as jormundur and a half dozen of nasuada is commanders drew their swords at the intruders
the men lowered their weapons as nasuada said come here eragon
what is your bidding eragon asked
our scouts report that a company of some hundred kull approach from the northeast
eragon frowned
he had not expected to encounter urgals in this battle since durza no longer controlled them and so many had been killed in farthen dur
but if they had come they had come
he felt his bloodlust rise and allowed himself a savage grin as he contemplated destroying urgals with his new strength
clapping his hand to zar roc is hilt he said it will be a pleasure to eliminate them
saphira and i can handle it by ourselves if you want
nasuada watched his face carefully as she said we can not do that eragon
they re flying a white flag and they have asked to talk with me
eragon gaped at her
surely you do not intend to grant them an audience
i will offer them the same courtesies i would to any foe who arrives under the banner of truce
they re brutes though
** it is folly to allow them into the camp
nasuada i have seen the atrocities urgals commit
they relish pain and suffering and deserve no more mercy than a rabid dog
there is no need for you to waste time over what is surely a trap
just give the word and i and every last one of your warriors will be more than willing to kill these foul creatures for you
in this said jormundur i agree with eragon
if you wo not listen to us nasuada at least listen to him
first nasuada said to eragon in a murmur low enough that no one else could hear your training is indeed unfinished if you are so ** then she raised her voice and in it eragon heard the same adamantine notes of command that her father had possessed you all forget that i fought in farthen dur the same as you and that i saw the savagery of the urgals
however i also saw our own men commit acts just as heinous
i shall not denigrate what we have endured at the urgals hands but neither shall i ignore potential allies when we are so greatly outnumbered by the empire
my lady it is too dangerous for you to meet with a kull
too dangerous nasuada raised an eyebrow
while i am protected by eragon saphira elva and all the warriors around me i think not
eragon gritted his teeth with ** something saphira
youcan convince her to abandon this harebrained scheme
no i wo not
your mind is clouded on this issue
you can not agree with ** eragon ** were there in yazuac with me you know what the urgals did to the villagers
and what about when we left teirm my capture at gil ead and farthen dur every time we ve encountered urgals they ve tried to kill us or worse
they re nothing more than vicious animals
the elves believed the same thing about dragons during du fyrn skulblaka
at nasuada is behest her guards tied back the front and side panels of the pavilion leaving it open for all to see and allowing saphira to crouch low next to eragon
then nasuada seated herself in her high backed chair and jormundur and the other commanders arranged themselves in two parallel rows so that anyone who sought an audience with her had to walk between them
eragon stood at her right hand elva by her left
less than five minutes later a great roar of anger erupted from the eastern edge of the camp
the storm of jeers and insults grew louder and louder until a single kull entered their view walking toward nasuada while a mob of the varden peppered him with taunts
the urgal or ram as eragon remembered they were called held his head high and bared his yellow fangs but did not otherwise react to the abuse directed at him
he was a magnificent specimen eight and a half feet tall with strong proud if grotesque features thick horns that spiraled all the way around and a fantastic musculature that made it seem he could kill a bear with a single blow
his only clothing was a knotted loincloth a few plates of crude iron armor held together with scraps of mail and a curved metal disk nestled between his two horns to protect the top of his head
