eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye
the prints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half hour before
soon they would bed down
his target a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot was still with the herd
he was amazed she had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her
the sky was clear and dark and a slight breeze stirred the air
a silvery cloud drifted over the mountains that surrounded him its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two peaks
streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks
a brooding mist crept along the valley is floor almost thick enough to obscure his feet
eragon was fifteen less than a year from manhood
dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown eyes
his clothes were worn from work
a hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist
he carried a wood frame pack
the deer had led him deep into the spine a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of alagaesia
strange tales and men often came from those mountains usually boding ill
despite that eragon did not fear the spine he was the only hunter near carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses
it was the third night of the hunt and his food was half gone
if he did not fell the doe he would be forced to return home empty handed
his family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in carvahall
eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight then strode into the forest toward a glen where he was sure the deer would rest
the trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows on the ground
he looked at the tracks only occasionally he knew the way
at the glen he strung his bow with a sure touch then drew three arrows and nocked one holding the others in his left hand
the moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass
the doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly
eragon slowly crept closer keeping the bow ready
all his work of the past three days had led to this moment
he took a last steadying breath and an explosion shattered the night
the herd bolted
eragon lunged forward racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek
he slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe
it missed by a finger is breadth and hissed into darkness
he cursed and spun around instinctively nocking another arrow
behind him where the deer had been smoldered a large circle of grass and trees
many of the pines stood bare of their needles
the grass outside the charring was flattened
a wisp of smoke curled in the air carrying a burnt smell
in the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone
mist snaked across the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone
eragon watched for danger for several long minutes but the only thing that moved was the mist
cautiously he released the tension from his bow and moved forward
moonlight cast him in pale shadow as he stopped before the stone
he nudged it with an arrow then jumped back
nothing happened so he warily picked it up
nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one
its flawless surface was dark blue except for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it
the stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers like hardened silk
oval and about a foot long it weighed several pounds though it felt lighter than it should have
eragon found the stone both beautiful and ** did it come from does it have a purpose then a more disturbing thought came to him was it sent here by accident or am i meant to have it if he had learned anything from the old stories it was to treat magic and those who used it with great caution
but what should i do with the stone it would be tiresome to carry and there was a chance it was dangerous
it might be better to leave it behind
a flicker of indecision ran through him and he almost dropped it but something stayed his ** the very least it might pay for some food he decided with a shrug tucking the stone into his pack
