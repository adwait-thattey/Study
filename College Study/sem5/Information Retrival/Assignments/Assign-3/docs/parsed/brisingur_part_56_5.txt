the eldunari itself was like a giant gold jewel
its surface was warm and covered with hundreds of sharp facets which varied somewhat in size and sometimes projected at odd slanting angles
the center of the eldunari glowed with a dull radiance similar to that of a shuttered lantern and the diffuse light throbbed with a slow steady beat
upon first inspection the light appeared uniform but the longer eragon gazed at it the more details he saw within it small eddies and currents that coiled and twisted in seemingly random directions darker motes that barely moved at all and flurries of bright flashes no larger than the head of a pin that would flare for a moment then fade back into the underlying field of light
it was alive
here said oromis and handed eragon a sturdy cloth sack
to eragon is relief his connection with glaedr vanished as soon as he placed the eldunari in the bag and his hands were no longer touching the gemlike stone
still somewhat shaken eragon clasped the cloth covered eldunari against his chest awed by the knowledge that his arms were wrapped around glaedr is essence and afraid of what might happen to it if he allowed the heart of hearts out of his grasp
thank you master eragon managed to say bowing his head toward glaedr
we shall guard your heart with our lives saphira added
** exclaimed oromis his voice fierce
not with your ** that is the very thing we wish to avoid
do not allow any misfortune to befall glaedr is heart because of carelessness on your part but neither should you sacrifice yourself to protect him or me or anyone else
you have to stay alive at all costs else our hopes shall be dashed and all will be darkness
yes master eragon and saphira said at the same time he with his tongue and she with her thoughts
said glaedr because you swore fealty to nasuada and you owe her your loyalty and obedience you may tell her of my heart if you must but only if you must
for the sake of dragons everywhere what few of us remain the truth about the eldunari cannot become common knowledge
may we tell arya asked saphira
and what about blodhgarm and the other elves islanzadi sent to protect me asked eragon
i allowed them into my mind when saphira and i last fought murtagh
they will notice your presence glaedr if you help us in the midst of a battle
you may inform blodhgarm and his spellcasters of the eldunari said glaedr but only after they have sworn oaths of secrecy to you
oromis placed his helm on his head
arya is islanzadi is daughter and so i suppose it is proper she should know
however as with nasuada do not tell her unless it becomes absolutely necessary
a secret shared is no secret at all
if you can be so disciplined do not even think of it nor of the very fact of the eldunari so that no one may steal the information from your minds
now let us be gone from here said oromis and drew a pair of thick gauntlets over his hands
i have heard from islanzadi that nasuada has laid siege to the city of feinster and the varden have great need of you
we have spent too long in ellesmera said saphira
perhaps said glaedr but it was time well spent
taking a short running start oromis bounded up glaedr is single foreleg and onto his high jagged back where oromis settled into his saddle and began to tighten the straps around his legs
as we fly said the elf calling down to eragon we can review the lists of true names you learned during your last visit
eragon went to saphira and carefully climbed onto her back wrapped one of his blankets around glaedr is heart and packed the bundle in his saddlebags
then he secured his legs in the same manner as had oromis
behind him he could feel a constant thrum of energy radiating from the eldunari
glaedr walked to the edge of the crags of tel naeir and unfurled his voluminous wings
the earth shook as the gold dragon leaped toward the cloud streaked sky and the air boomed and shuddered as glaedr drove his wings downward pulling away from the ocean of trees below
eragon gripped the spike in front of him as saphira followed flinging herself out into open space and falling several hundred feet in a steep dive before she ascended to glaedr is side
