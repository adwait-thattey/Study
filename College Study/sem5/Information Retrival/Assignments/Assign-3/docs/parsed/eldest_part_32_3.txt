it was as if his deeds had inflated his stature and intimidated the people he had known since childhood distancing him from them
i am branded thought roran limping through the mud
he stopped at the edge of a puddle and bent to examine his reflection curious if he could discern what made him so different
he saw a man in ragged blood stained clothes with a humped back and a crooked arm tied across his chest
his neck and cheeks were scumbled with an impending beard while his hair was matted into snarled ropes that writhed in a halo around his head
most frightening of all though were his eyes which had sunk deep into the sockets giving him a haunted appearance
from within those two morbid caverns his gaze boiled like molten steel full of loss rage and an obsessive craving
a lopsided smile crept across roran is face rendering his visage even more shocking
he liked how he looked
it matched his feelings
now he understood how he had managed to influence the villagers
he bared his ** can use this image
i can use it to destroy the ra zac
lifting his head he slouched up the street pleased with himself
just then thane approached him and grasped his left forearm in a hearty grip
** you do not know how glad i am to see you
you are roran wondered if the whole world had been turned inside out during the night
thane nodded vigorously
ever since we attacked the soldiers everything has seemed hopeless to me
it pains me to admit it but so it was
my heart pounded all the time like i was about to fall down a well my hands shook and i felt dreadfully ill
i thought someone had poisoned ** it was worse than death
but what you said yesterday healed me instantly and let me see purpose and meaning in the world ** i
i can not even explain the horror you saved me from
i am in your debt
if you need or want anything just ask and i will help
moved roran gripped the farmer is forearm in return and said thank you thane
thank ** thane bowed his head tears in his eyes then released roran and left him standing alone in the middle of the street
