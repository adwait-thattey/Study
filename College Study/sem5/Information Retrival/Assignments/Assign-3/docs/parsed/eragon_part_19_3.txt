what is wrong with you he demanded irritably
nothing she ** is funny to see a hatchling like you beaten by the old one
she made the sound again and eragon turned red as he realized that she was laughing
trying to preserve some dignity he rolled onto his side and fell asleep
he felt even worse the next day
bruises covered his arms and he was almost too sore to move
brom looked up from the mush he was serving and grinned
how do you feel eragon grunted and bolted down the breakfast
once on the road they traveled swiftly so as to reach therinsford before noon
after a league the road widened and they saw smoke in the distance
you d better tell saphira to fly ahead and wait for us on the other side of therinsford said brom
she has to be careful here otherwise people are bound to notice her
why do not you tell her yourself challenged eragon
it is considered bad manners to interfere with another is dragon
you did not have a problem with it in carvahall
brom is lips twitched with a smile
i did what i had to
eragon eyed him darkly then relayed the instructions
saphira warned be careful the empire is servants could be hiding anywhere
as the ruts in the road deepened eragon noticed more footprints
farms signaled their approach to therinsford
the village was larger than carvahall but it had been constructed haphazardly the houses aligned in no particular order
what a mess said eragon
he could not see dempton is ** and albriech have surely fetched roran by now
either way eragon had no wish to face his cousin
it is ugly if nothing else agreed brom
the anora river flowed between them and the town spanned by a stout bridge
as they approached it a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way
his shirt was too short and his dirty stomach spilled over a rope belt
behind his cracked lips his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones
you c n stop right there
this is my bridge
gotta pay t get over
how much asked brom in a resigned voice
he pulled out a pouch and the bridgekeeper brightened
five crowns he said pulling his lips into a broad smile
eragon is temper flared at the exorbitant price and he started to complain hotly but brom silenced him with a quick look
the coins were wordlessly handed over
the man put them into a sack hanging from his belt
thank ee much he said in a mocking tone and stood out of the way
as brom stepped forward he stumbled and caught the bridgekeeper is arm to support himself
watch y re step snarled the grimy man sidling away
sorry apologized brom and continued over the bridge with eragon
why did not you haggle he skinned you ** exclaimed eragon when they were out of earshot
he probably does not even own the bridge
we could have pushed right past him
because you can not argue with all of the fools in the world
it is easier to let them have their way then trick them when they re not paying ** brom opened his hand and a pile of coins glinted in the light
you cut his ** said eragon incredulously
brom pocketed the money with a wink
and it held a surprising amount
he should know better than to keep all these coins in one ** there was a sudden howl of anguish from the other side of the river
i d say our friend has just discovered his loss
if you see any watchmen tell ** he grabbed the shoulder of a young boy running between the houses and asked do you know where we can buy horses the child stared at them with solemn eyes then pointed to a large barn near the edge of therinsford
thank you said brom tossing him a small coin
the barn is large double doors were open revealing two long rows of stalls
the far wall was covered with saddles harnesses and other paraphernalia
a man with muscular arms stood at the end brushing a white stallion
he raised a hand and beckoned for them to come over
as they approached brom said that is a beautiful animal
yes indeed
his name is snowfire
mine is ** haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands vigorously with eragon and brom
there was a polite pause as he waited for their names in return
when they were not forthcoming he asked can i help you
brom nodded
