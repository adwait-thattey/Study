as with many authors who undertake an epic the length of the inheritance trilogy i have found that the creation of eragon and noweldest has become my own personal quest one that has proven every bit as transforming as eragon is
when first i conceivederagon i was fifteen not quite a boy and not yet a man just out of high school unsure of what path to take in life and addicted to the potent magic of the fantasy literature that adorned my shelves
the process of writingeragon marketing it across the world and now finally completingeldest has swept me into adulthood
i am twenty one now and to my continual astonishment have already published two novels
stranger things have occurred i am sure but never to me
eragon is journey has been my own plucked from a sheltered rural upbringing and forced to rove the land in a desperate race against time enduring intense and arduous training achieving success against all expectations dealing with the consequences of fame and eventually finding a measure of peace
just as in fiction when the determined and well meaning protagonist who really is not all that bright now is he is helped along his way by a host of wiser characters so too have i been guided by a number of stupendously talented people
they are
