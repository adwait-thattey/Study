nor can i hope to compete with the elves with magic or match their accomplishments with the crafts i am familiar with
their talent exceeds that of the finest artisans in the empire
but you possess one quality that no one else does said saphira
your identity
your history deeds and situation
use those to shape your creation and you will produce something unique
whatever you make base it upon that which is most important to you
only then will it have depth and meaning and only then will it resonate with others
he looked at her with ** never realized that you knew so much about art
i do not she ** forget i spent an afternoon watching oromis paint his scrolls while you flew with glaedr
oromis discussed the topic quite a bit
after saphira left to pursue her project eragon paced along the edge of the open portal in the bedroom pondering what she had ** is important to me he asked ** and arya of course and being a good rider but what can i say about those subjects that is not blindingly obvious i appreciate beauty in nature but again the elves have already expressed everything possible on that topic
ellesmera itself is a monument to their devotion
he turned his gaze inward and scrutinized himself to determine what struck the deepest darkest chords within him
what stirred him with enough passion of either love or hate that he burned to share it with others
three things presented themselves to him his injury at the hands of durza his fear of one day fighting galbatorix and the elves epics that so engrossed him
a rush of excitement flared within eragon as a story combining those elements took form in his mind
light on his feet he ran up the twisting stairs two at a time to the study where he sat before the writing desk dipped quill in ink and held it trembling over a pale sheet of paper
the nib rasped as he made the first stroke
in the kingdom by the sea
in the mountains mantled blue
the words flowed from his pen seemingly of their own accord
he felt as if he were not inventing his tale but merely acting as a conduit to transport it fully formed into the world
having never composed a work of his own before eragon was gripped by the thrill of discovery that accompanies new ventures especially since previously he had not suspected that he might enjoy being a bard
he labored in a frenzy not stopping for bread or drink his tunic sleeves rolled past his elbows to protect them from the ink flicked from his quill by the wild force of his writing
so intense was his concentration he heard nothing but the beat of his poem saw nothing but the empty paper and thought of nothing but the phrases etched in lines of fire behind his eyes
an hour and a half later he dropped the quill from his cramped hand pushed his chair away from the desk and stood
fourteen pages lay before him
it was the most he had ever written at one time
eragon knew that his poem could not match those of the elves and dwarves great authors but he hoped it was honest enough that the elves would not laugh at his effort
he recited the poem to saphira when she returned
afterward she said ah eragon you have changed much since we left palancar valley
you would not recognize the untested boy who first set out for vengeance i ** could not have written a lay after the style of the elves
i look forward to seeing who you become in the next fifty or a hundred years
he ** i live that long
rough but true was what oromis said when eragon read him the poem
tis a good portrait of your mental state at the present and an engaging read but no masterpiece
did you expect it to be
however i am surprised that you can give voice to it in this tongue
no barrier exists towriting fiction in the ancient language
the difficulty arises when one attempts to speak it for that would require you to tell untruths which the magic will not allow
i can say it replied eragon because i believe it is true
and that gives your writing far more power
i am impressed eragon finiarel
your poem will be a worthy addition to the blood oath ** raising a finger oromis reached within his robe and gave eragon a scroll tied shut with ribbon
