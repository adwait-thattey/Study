the urgal roared and waved his weapon but did not charge
** barked eragon stabbing out with magic
the urgal is face contorted with terror as he exploded in a flash of blue light
blood splattered eragon and a brown mass flew through the air
behind him saphira bugled with alarm and reared
eragon twisted around
while he had been occupied with the first urgal a group of them had run up from the ** all the stupid tricks to fall for
steel clashed loudly as murtagh attacked the urgals
eragon tried to join him but was blocked by four of the monsters
the first one swung a sword at his shoulder
he ducked the blow and killed the urgal with magic
he caught a second one in the throat with zar roc wheeled wildly and slashed a third through the heart
as he did the fourth urgal rushed at him swinging a heavy club
eragon saw him coming and tried to lift his sword to block the club but was a second too slow
as the club came down on his head he screamed fly ** a burst of light filled his eyes and he lost consciousness
the first things eragon noticed were that he was warm and dry his cheek was pressed against rough fabric and his hands were unbound
he stirred but it was minutes before he was able to push himself upright and examine his surroundings
he was sitting in a cell on a narrow bumpy cot
a barred window was set high in the wall
the iron bound door with a small window in its top half barred like the one in the wall was shut securely
dried blood cracked on eragon is face when he moved
it took him a moment to remember that it was not his
his head hurt horribly which was to be expected considering the blow he had taken and his mind was strangely fuzzy
he tried to use magic but could not concentrate well enough to remember any of the ancient ** must have drugged me he finally decided
with a groan he got up missing the familiar weight of zar roc on his hip and lurched to the window in the wall
he managed to see out of it by standing on his toes
it took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the bright light outside
the window was level with the ground
a street full of busy people ran past the side of his cell beyond which were rows of identical log houses
feeling weak eragon slid to the floor and stared at it blankly
what he had seen outside disturbed him but he was unsure why
cursing his sluggish thinking he leaned back his head and tried to clear his mind
a man entered the room and set a tray of food and a pitcher of water on the ** not that nice of him thought eragon smiling pleasantly
he took a couple of bites of the thin cabbage soup and stale bread but was barely able to stomach ** wish he had brought me something better he complained dropping the spoon
he suddenly realized what was ** was captured by urgals not ** how did i end up here his befuddled brain grappled with the paradox unsuccessfully
with a mental shrug he filed the discovery away for a time when he would know what to do with it
he sat on the cot and gazed into the distance
hours later more food was brought ** i was just getting hungry he thought thickly
this time he was able to eat without feeling sick
when he finished he decided it was time for a nap
after all he was on a bed what else was he going to do
his mind drifted off sleep began to envelop him
then a gate clanged open somewhere and the din of steel shod boots marching on a stone floor filled the air
the noise grew louder and louder until it sounded like someone banging a pot inside eragon is head
he grumbled to ** not they let me rest in peace fuzzy curiosity slowly overcame his exhaustion so he dragged himself to the door blinking like an owl
through the window he saw a wide hallway nearly ten yards across
the opposing wall was lined with cells similar to his own
a column of soldiers marched through the hall their swords drawn and ready
every man was dressed in matching armor their faces bore the same hard expression and their feet came down on the floor with mechanical precision never missing a beat
the sound was hypnotic
it was an impressive display of force
eragon watched the soldiers until he grew bored
