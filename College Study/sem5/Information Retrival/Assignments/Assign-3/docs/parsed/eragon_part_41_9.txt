it was less than a tenth of the height of the crater that loomed over and around it but its diminutive appearance was deceiving for it was slightly higher than a mile
long as it was the tunnel had only taken them through one side of the crater wall
as eragon stared he heard orik say deeply look well human for no rider has set eyes upon this for nigh over a hundred years
the airy peak under which we stand is farthen dur discovered thousands of years ago by the father of our race korgan while he tunneled for gold
and in the center stands our greatest achievement tronjheim the city mountain built from the purest ** the doors grated to a halt
then eragon saw the crowd
he had been so engrossed by the sights that he had failed to notice a dense sea of people clustered around the tunnel is entrance
they lined the cobblestone pathway dwarves and humans packed together like trees in a thicket
there were hundreds
thousands of them
every eye every face was focused on eragon
and every one of them was silent
eragon gripped the base of one of saphira is neck spikes
he saw children in dirty smocks hardy men with scarred knuckles women in homespun dresses and stout weathered dwarves who fingered their beards
all of them bore the same taut expression that of an injured animal when a predator is nearby and escape is impossible
a bead of sweat rolled down eragon is face but he dared not move to wipe it ** should i do he asked frantically
smile raise your hand ** saphira sharply
eragon tried to force out a smile but his lips only twitched
gathering his courage he pushed a hand into the air jerking it in a little wave
when nothing happened he flushed with embarrassment lowered his arm and ducked his head
a single cheer broke the silence
someone clapped loudly
for a brief second the crowd hesitated then a wild roar swept through it and a wave of sound crashed over eragon
very good said the bald man from behind him
now start walking
relieved eragon sat straighter and playfully asked saphira shall we go she arched her neck and stepped forward
as they passed the first row of people she glanced to each side and exhaled a puff of smoke
the crowd quieted and shrank back then resumed cheering their enthusiasm only intensified
show off chided eragon
saphira flicked her tail and ignored him
he stared curiously at the jostling crowd as she proceeded along the path
dwarves greatly outnumbered humans
and many of them glared at him resentfully
some even turned their backs and walked away with stony faces
the humans were hard tough people
all the men had daggers or knives at their waists many were armed for war
the women carried themselves proudly but they seemed to conceal a deep abiding weariness
the few children and babies stared at eragon with large eyes
he felt certain that these people had experienced much hardship and that they would do whatever was necessary to defend themselves
the varden had found the perfect hiding place
farthen dur is walls were too high for a dragon to fly over and no army could break through the entranceway even if it managed to find the hidden doors
the crowd followed close behind them giving saphira plenty of room
gradually the people quieted though their attention remained on eragon
he looked back and saw murtagh riding stiffly his face pale
they neared the city mountain and eragon saw that the white marble of tronjheim was highly polished and shaped into flowing contours as if it had been poured into place
it was dotted with countless round windows framed by elaborate carvings
a colored lantern hung in each window casting a soft glow on the surrounding rock
no turrets or smokestacks were visible
directly ahead two thirty foot high gold griffins guarded a massive timber gate recessed twenty yards into the base of tronjheim which was shadowed by thick trusses that supported an arched vault far overhead
when they reached tronjheim is base saphira paused to see if the bald man had any instructions
when none were forthcoming she continued to the gate
the walls were lined with fluted pillars of blood red jasper
