you can let go of me jormundur she said and mustered a weak smile
i am all right now
and my uncle undset was an elf
** you are the same as your father always ignoring caution when it comes to your own safety
the tribes can rot in their bloody old customs for all i care
let a healer at you
you re in no condition to make decisions
that is why i waited until it was evening
see the sun is almost down
i can rest tonight and tomorrow i will be able to deal with the affairs that require my attention
farica appeared from the side and hovered over nasuada
oh ma am you gave us quite a fright there
still are as a matter of fact muttered jormundur
well i am better ** nasuada pushed herself upright in the chair ignoring the heat from her forearms
you can both go i shall be fine
jormundur send word to fadawar that he may remain chief of his own tribe so long as he swears loyalty to me as his warlord
he is too skilled a leader to waste
and farica on your way back to your tent please inform angela the herbalist that i require her services
she agreed to mix some tonics and poultices for me
i wo not leave you alone in this condition declared jormundur
farica nodded
begging your pardon my lady but i agree with him
it is not safe
nasuada glanced toward the entrance to the pavilion to ensure none of the nighthawks were close enough to overhear and then dropped her voice into a low whisper
i shall not be ** jormundur is eyebrows shot up and an alarmed expression crossed farica is face
i am never alone
do you understand
you have taken certain
precautions my lady asked jormundur
both her caretakers appeared uneasy with her assurance and jormundur said nasuada your safety is my responsibility i need to know what additional protection you may have and who exactly has access to your person
no she said gently
seeing the hurt and indignation that appeared in jormundur is eyes she continued
it is not that i doubt your loyalty far from it
only this i must have for myself
for the sake of my own peace of mind i need to have a dagger no one else can see a hidden weapon tucked up my sleeve if you will
consider it a flaw in my character but do not torment yourself by imagining my choice is in any way a criticism of how you perform your duties
my ** jormundur bowed a formality he almost never used with her
nasuada lifted her hand indicating her permission for them to leave and jormundur and farica hurried from the red pavilion
for a long minute perhaps two the only sound nasuada heard was the harsh cry of gore crows circling above the varden is encampment
then from behind her there came a slight rustling like that of a mouse nosing about for food
turning her head she saw elva slip out of her hiding place emerging between two panels of fabric into the main chamber of the pavilion
the girl is unnatural growth had continued
when nasuada first met her but a short while ago elva had appeared between three and four years old
now she looked closer to six
her plain dress was black with a few folds of purple around the neck and shoulders
her long straight hair was even darker a liquid void that flowed down to the small of her back
her sharp angled face was bone white for she rarely ventured outside
the dragon mark on her brow was silver
and her eyes her violet eyes contained a jaded cynical air the result of eragon is blessing that was a curse for it forced her to both endure other people is pain and also try to prevent it
the recent battle had almost killed her what with the combined agony of thousands beating upon her mind even though one of du vrangr gata had placed her in an artificial slumber for the duration of the fighting in an attempt to protect her
only recently had the girl begun to speak and take interest in her surroundings again
she wiped her rosebud mouth with the back of her hand and nasuada asked were you ill
elva shrugged
the pain i am used to but it never gets any easier to resist eragon is spell
i am hard to impress nasuada but you are a strong woman to withstand so many cuts
even though nasuada had heard it many times elva is voice still inspired a thrill of alarm in her for it was the bitter mocking voice of a world weary adult not that of a child
