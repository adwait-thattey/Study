the ultimate example of this phenomenon was the menoa tree which was once the elf linnea
the tree seemed to quicken with life at the activity in the clearing
its branches stirred though no breeze touched them at times the creaks of its trunk could be heard to match the flow of music and an air of gentle benevolence emanated from the tree and lay upon those in the vicinity
and he remembered two attacks from his back screaming and groaning in the shadows while the mad elves continued their revels around him and only saphira came to guard over him
on the third day of the agaeti blodhren or so eragon later learned he delivered his verses to the elves
he stood and said i am no smith nor skilled at carving or weaving or pottery or painting or any of the arts
nor can i rival your accomplishments with spells
thus all that remains to me are my own experiences which i have attempted to interpret through the lens of a story though i am also no ** then in the manner that brom had performed lays in carvahall eragon chanted
in the kingdom by the sea
was born a man with but one task
to kill the foe in durza
nurtured by the kind and wis
under oaks as old as time
he ran with deer and wrestled bears
and from his elders learned the skills
to kill the foe in durza
taught to spy the thief in blac
when he grabs the weak and strong
to block his blows and fight the fien
with rag and rock and plant and bone
and kill the foe in durza
quick as thought the years did turn
til the man had come of age
his body burned with fevered rage
while youth is impatience seared his veins
then he met a maiden fair
who was tall and strong and wise
her brow adorned with geda is light
which shone upon her trailing gown
in her eyes of midnight blue
appeared to him a future bright
together where they would not hav
to fear the foe in durza
so eragon told of how the man voyaged to the land of durza where he found and fought the foe despite the cold terror within his heart
yet though at last he triumphed the man withheld the fatal blow for now that he had defeated his enemy he did not fear the doom of mortals
he did not need to kill the foe in durza
then the man sheathed his sword and returned home and wed his love on summer is eve
with her he spent his many days content until his beard was long and white
but
in the dark before the dawn
in the room where slept the man
the foe he crept and loomed abov
his mighty rival now so weak
from his pillow did the ma
raise his head and gaze upo
the cold and empty face of death
he d lost all fear of death is embrace
the last embrace a man will know
bent the foe and from the ma
and thence in peace they went to dwell
eragon fell quiet and conscious of the eyes upon him ducked his head and quickly found his seat
he felt embarrassed that he had revealed so much of himself
the elf lord dathedr said you underestimate yourself shadeslayer
it seems that you have discovered a new talent
islanzadi raised one pale hand
your work shall be added to the great library in tialdari hall eragon finiarel so that all who wish can appreciate it
though your poem is allegory i believe that it has helped many of us to better understand the hardships you have faced since saphira is egg appeared to you for which we are in no small way responsible
you must read it to us again so we may think upon this further
pleased eragon bowed his head and did as she commanded
afterward was time for saphira to present her work to the elves
she flew off into the night and returned with a black stone thrice the size of a large man clutched in her talons
landing on her hind legs she placed the stone upright in the middle of the bare greensward in full view of everyone
the glossy rock had been melted and somehow molded into intricate curves that wound about each other like frozen waves
the striated tongues of rock twisted in such convoluted patterns that the eye had difficulty following a single piece from base to tip but rather flitted from one coil to the next
as it was his first time seeing the sculpture eragon gazed at it with as much interest as the ** did you make this
