the sea is emotion incarnate
it loves hates and weeps
it defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles
no matter what you say about it there is always that which you can not
do you remember what i told you about how the elves came over the sea
though they live far from the coast they retain a great fascination and passion for the ocean
the sound of crashing waves the smell of salt air it affects them deeply and has inspired many of their loveliest songs
there is one that tells of this love if you want to hear it
brom cleared his throat and said i will translate it from the ancient language as best i can
it wo not be perfect but perhaps it will give you an idea of how the original ** he pulled snowfire to a stop and closed his eyes
he was silent for a while then chanted softly
o liquid temptress neath the azure sky
your gilded expanse calls me calls me
for i would sail ever on
were it not for the elven maid
she binds my heart with a lily white tie
never to be broken save by the sea
ever to be torn twixt the trees and the waves
the words echoed hauntingly in eragon is head
there is much more to that song the du silbena ** i have only recited one of its verses
it tells the sad tale of two lovers acallamh and nuada who were separated by longing for the sea
the elves find great meaning in the story
the spine was a faint outline on the horizon when they halted that evening
when they arrived at the spine is foothills they turned and followed the mountains south
eragon was glad to be near the mountains again they placed comforting boundaries on the world
three days later they came to a wide road rutted by wagon wheels
this is the main road between the capital uru baen and teirm said brom
it is widely used and a favorite route for merchants
we have to be more cautious
this is not the busiest time of year but a few people are bound to be using the road
days passed quickly as they continued to trek along the spine searching for the mountain pass
eragon could not complain of boredom
when not learning the elven language he was either learning how to care for saphira or practicing magic
eragon also learned how to kill game with magic which saved them time hunting
he would hold a small rock on his hand and shoot it at his prey
it was impossible to miss
the results of his efforts roasted over the fire each night
and after dinner brom and eragon would spar with swords and occasionally fists
the long days and strenuous work stripped eragon is body of excess fat
his arms became corded and his tanned skin rippled with lean ** about me is turning hard he thought dryly
when they finally reached the pass eragon saw that a river rushed out of it and cut across the road
this is the toark explained brom
we will follow it all the way to the sea
how can we laughed eragon if it flows out of the spine inthis direction it wo not end up in the ocean unless it doubles back on itself
brom twisted the ring on his finger
because in the middle of the mountains rests the woadark lake
a river flows from each end of it and both are called the toark
we see the eastward one now
it runs to the south and winds through the brush until it joins leona lake
the other one goes to the sea
after two days in the spine they came upon a rock ledge from which they could see clearly out of the mountains
eragon noticed how the land flattened in the distance and he groaned at the leagues they still had to traverse
brom pointed
down there and to the north lies teirm
it is an old city
some say it is where the elves first landed in alagaesia
its citadel has never fallen nor have its warriors ever been ** he spurred snowfire forward and left the ledge
it took them until noon the next day to descend through the foothills and arrive at the other side of the spine where the forested land quickly leveled out
without the mountains to hide behind saphira flew close to the ground using every hollow and dip in the land to conceal herself
beyond the forest they noticed a change
the countryside was covered with soft turf and heather that their feet sank into
