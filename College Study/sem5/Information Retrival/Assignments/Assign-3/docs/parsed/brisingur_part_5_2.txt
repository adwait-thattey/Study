he allowed all of his anger and grief over the events of that day as well as garrow is murder and the destruction of their farm to surge forth and give him the courage nay the desire to face the ra zac in combat
eragon said saphira
today we need not guard our minds and keep our thoughts secret from one another do we
not unless another magician should appear
a fan of golden light flared into existence as the top of the sun crested the horizon
in an instant the full spectrum of colors enlivened the previously drab world the mist glowed white the water became a rich blue the daubed mud wall that encircled the center of dras leona revealed its dingy yellow sides the trees cloaked themselves in every shade of green and the soil blushed red and orange
helgrind however remained as it always was black
the mountain of stone rapidly grew larger as they approached
even from the air it was intimidating
diving toward the base of helgrind saphira tilted so far to her left eragon and roran would have fallen if they had not already strapped their legs to the saddle
then she whipped around the apron of scree and over the altar where the priests of helgrind observed their ceremonies
the lip of eragon is helm caught the wind from her passage and produced a howl that almost deafened him
well shouted roran
he could not see in front of them
a great weight seemed to press eragon into his seat as saphira pulled out of her dive and spiraled up around helgrind searching for an entrance to the ra zac is hideout
not even a hole big enough for a woodrat she declared
she slowed and hung in place before a ridge that connected the third lowest of the four peaks to the prominence above
the jagged buttress magnified the boom produced by each stroke of her wings until it was as loud as a thunderclap
eragon is eyes watered as the air pulsed against his skin
a web of white veins adorned the backside of the crags and pillars where hoarfrost had collected in the cracks that furrowed the rock
nothing else disturbed the gloom of helgrind is inky windswept ramparts
no trees grew among the slanting stones nor shrubs grass or lichen nor did eagles dare nest upon the tower is broken ledges
true to its name helgrind was a place of death and stood cloaked in the razor sharp sawtooth folds of its scarps and clefts like a bony specter risen to haunt the earth
casting his mind outward eragon confirmed the presence of the two people whom he had discovered imprisoned within helgrind the previous day but he felt nothing of the slaves and to his concern he still could not locate the ra zac or the lethrblaka
if they are not here then where he wondered
searching again he noticed something that had eluded him before a single flower a gentian blooming not fifty feet in front of them where by all rights there ought to be solid rock
how does it get enough light to live
saphira answered his question by perching on a crumbling spur several feet to the right
as she did she lost her balance for a moment and flared her wings to steady herself
instead of brushing against the bulk of helgrind the tip of her right wing dipped into the rock and then back out again
leaning forward saphira pushed the tip of her snout toward the sheer rock paused an inch or two away as if waiting for a trap to spring then continued her advance
scale by scale saphira is head slid into helgrind until all that was visible of her to eragon was a neck torso and wings
with a surge of her mighty thews she abandoned the spur and flung the rest of her body after her head
it required every bit of eragon is self control not to cover his face in a desperate bid to protect himself as the crag rushed toward him
an instant later he found himself looking at a broad vaulted cave suffused with the warm glow of morning
saphira is scales refracted the light casting thousands of shifting blue flecks across the rock
twisting around eragon saw no wall behind them only the mouth of the cave and a sweeping view of the landscape beyond
eragon grimaced
it had never occurred to him that galbatorix might have hidden the ra zac is lair with magic
