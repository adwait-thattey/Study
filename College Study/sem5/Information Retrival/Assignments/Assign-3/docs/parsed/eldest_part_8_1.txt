dirt crunched under roran is boots as he led the way down the valley which was cool and pale in the early hours of the overcast morning
baldor followed close behind both of them carrying strung bows
neither spoke as they studied their surroundings for signs of the deer
there said baldor in a low voice pointing at a set of tracks leading toward a bramble on the edge of the anora
roran nodded and started after the spoor
it looked about a day old so he risked speaking
could i have your advice baldor you seem to have a good understanding of people
for a long time the pad of their feet was the only noise
sloan wants to marry off katrina and not to me
every day that passes increases the chance he will arrange a union to his liking
what does katrina say of this
roran shrugged
he is her father
she cannot continue to defy his will when no one shedoes want has stepped forward to claim her
and that is why you were up so ** it was no question
in fact roran had been too worried to sleep at all
he had spent the entire night thinking about katrina trying to find a solution to their predicament
i can not bear to lose her
but i do not think sloan will give us his blessing what with my position and all
no i do not think he would agreed baldor
he glanced at roran out of the corner of his eye
what is it you want my advice on though
a snort of laughter escaped roran
how can i convince sloan otherwise how can i resolve this dilemma without starting a blood feud he threw his hands up
what should i do
i do but not of a sort i find pleasing
it occurred to me that katrina and i could simply announce we were engaged not that we are yet and hang the consequences
that would force sloan to accept our betrothal
a frown creased baldor is brow
he said carefully maybe but it would also create a slew of bad feelings throughout carvahall
few would approve of your actions
nor would it be wise to force katrina to choose between you or her family she might resent you for it in years to come
i know but what alternative do i have
before you take such a drastic step i recommend you try to win sloan over as an ally
there is a chance you might succeed after all if it is made clear to him that no one else will want to marry an angry katrina
especially when you re around to cuckold the ** roran grimaced and kept his gaze on the ground
baldor laughed
if you fail well then you can proceed with confidence knowing that you have indeed exhausted all other routes
and people will be less likely to spit upon you for breaking tradition and more likely to say sloan is bullheaded ways brought it upon himself
you knew that to begin ** baldor grew somber again
no doubt there will be harsh words if you challenge sloan but things will settle down in the end perhaps not comfortably but at least bearably
aside from sloan the only people you will really offend are prudes like quimby though how quimby can brew such a hale drink yet be so starched and bitter himself is beyond me
roran nodded understanding
grudges could simmer for years in carvahall
i am glad we could talk
it is been
he faltered thinking of all the discussions he and eragon used to share
they had been as eragon once said brothers in all but blood
it had been deeply comforting to know that someone existed who would listen to him no matter the time or circumstances
and to know that person would always help him no matter the cost
the absence of such a bond left roran feeling empty
baldor did not press him to finish his sentence but instead stopped to drink from his waterskin
roran continued for a few yards then halted as a scent intruded on his thoughts
it was the heavy odor of seared meat and charred pine ** would be here besides us breathing deeply he turned in a circle trying to determine the source of the fire
a slight gust brushed past him from farther down the road carrying a hot smoky wave
the aroma of food was intense enough to make his mouth water
he beckoned to baldor who hurried to his side
smell that
baldor nodded
together they returned to the road and followed it south
about a hundred feet away it bent around a copse of cottonwoods and curved out of view
