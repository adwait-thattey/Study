the moment eragon and murtagh were thoroughly surrounded the leader reined in his horse then crossed his arms and examined them critically
he raised his eyebrows
well these are better than the usual dregs we ** at least we got healthy ones this time
and we did not even have to shoot them
grieg will be ** the men chuckled
at his words a sinking sensation filled eragon is gut
a suspicion stirred in his **
now as for you two said the leader speaking to eragon and murtagh if you would be so good as to drop your weapons you will avoid being turned into living quivers by my ** the archers grinned suggestively the men laughed again
murtagh is only movement was to shift his sword
who are you and what do you want we are free men traveling through this land
you have no right to stop us
oh i have every right said the man contemptuously
and as for my name slaves do not address their masters in that manner unless they want to be beaten
eragon cursed to ** he remembered vividly the people he had seen at auction in dras leona
rage boiled within him
he glared at the men around him with new hatred and disgust
the lines deepened on the leader is face
throw down your swords and ** the slavers tensed staring at them with cold eyes as neither eragon nor murtagh lowered his weapon
eragon is palm tingled
he heard a rustle behind him then a loud curse
startled he spun around
one of the slavers had pulled the blanket off arya revealing her face
he gaped in astonishment then shouted torkenbrand this one is an ** the men stirred with surprise while the leader spurred his horse over to snowfire
he looked down at arya and whistled
well ow much is she worth someone asked
torkenbrand was quiet for a moment then spread his hands and said at the very least fortunes upon fortunes
the empire will pay a mountain of gold for **
the slavers yelled with excitement and pounded each other on the back
a roar filled eragon is mind as saphira banked sharply far ** ** he ** let them escape if they run
she immediately folded her wings and plummeted downward
eragon caught murtagh is attention with a sharp signal
murtagh took the cue
he smashed his elbow into a slaver is face knocking the man out of his saddle and jabbed his heels into tornac
with a toss of his mane the war horse jumped forward twirled around and reared
murtagh brandished his sword as tornac plunged back down driving his forehooves into the back of the dismounted slaver
the man screamed
before the slavers could gather their senses eragon scrambled out of the commotion and raised his hands invoking words in the ancient language
a globule of indigo fire struck the ground in the midst of the fray bursting into a fountain of molten drops that dissipated like sun warmed dew
a second later saphira dropped from the sky and landed next to him
she parted her jaws displaying her massive fangs and bellowed
** cried eragon over the furor i am a ** he raised zar roc over his head the red blade dazzling in the sunlight then pointed it at the slavers
flee if you wish to **
the men shouted incoherently and scrambled over each other in their haste to escape
in the confusion torkenbrand was struck in the temple with a javelin
he tumbled to the ground stunned
the men ignored their fallen leader and raced away in a ragged mass casting fearful looks at saphira
torkenbrand struggled to his knees
blood ran from his temple branching across his cheek with crimson tendrils
murtagh dismounted and strode over to him sword in hand
torkenbrand weakly raised his arm as if to ward off a blow
murtagh gazed at him coldly then swung his blade at torkenbrand is neck
** shouted eragon but it was too late
torkenbrand is decapitated trunk crumpled to the ground in a puff of dirt
his head landed with a hard thump
eragon rushed to murtagh his jaw working furiously
is your brain rotten he yelled enraged
why did you kill him
murtagh wiped his sword on the back of torkenbrand is jerkin
the steel left a dark stain
i do not see why you re so upset
** exploded eragon
i am well past ** did it even occur to you that we could just leave him here and continue on our way ** instead you turn into an executioner and chop off his head
