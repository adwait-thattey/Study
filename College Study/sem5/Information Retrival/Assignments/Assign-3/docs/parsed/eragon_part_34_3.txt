tears welled in eragon is eyes
this was the highest praise he could have ever received from ** responsibility i will bear honorably
we will go to gil ead then stated eragon strength and purpose returning to ** what of murtagh do you think he should come with us
we owe him our lives said ** even if that were not so he has seen both you and me
we should keep him close so he does not furnish the empire with our location and descriptions willingly or not
he agreed with her then told saphira about his ** i saw disturbed me
i feel that time is running out for her something dreadful is going to happen soon
she is in mortal danger i am sure of it but i do not know how to find ** she could be anywhere
what does your heart say asked saphira
my heart died a while back said eragon with a hint of black ** i think we should go north to gil ead
with any luck one of the towns or cities along our path is where this woman is being held
i am afraid that my next dream of her will show a grave
i could not stand that
i am not sure he said ** is just that when i see her i feel as if she is precious and should not be lost
it is very strange
saphira opened her long mouth and laughed silently fangs ** is it snapped eragon
she shook her head and quietly padded away
eragon grumbled to himself then told murtagh what they had decided
murtagh said if you find this dormnad and then continue on to the varden i will leave you
encountering the varden would be as dangerous for me as walking unarmed into uru baen with a fanfare of trumpets to announce my arrival
we wo not have to part anytime soon said eragon
it is a long way to gil ** his voice cracked slightly and he squinted at the sun to distract himself
we should leave before the day grows any older
are you strong enough to travel asked murtagh frowning
i have to do something or i will go crazy said eragon brusquely
sparring practicing magic or sitting around twiddling my thumbs are not good options right now so i choose to ride
they doused the fire packed and led the horses out of the cave
eragon handed cadoc is and snowfire is reins to murtagh saying go on i will be right ** murtagh began the slow descent from the cave
eragon struggled up the sandstone resting when his side made it impossible to breathe
when he reached the top he found saphira already there
they stood together before brom is grave and paid their last ** can not believe he is gone
forever
as eragon turned to depart saphira snaked out her long neck to touch the tomb with the tip of her nose
her sides vibrated as a low humming filled the air
the sandstone around her nose shimmered like gilded dew turning clear with dancing silver highlights
eragon watched in wonder as tendrils of white diamond twisted over the tomb is surface in a web of priceless filigree
sparkling shadows were cast on the ground reflecting splashes of brilliant colors that shifted dazzlingly as the sandstone continued to change
with a satisfied snort saphira stepped back and examined her handiwork
the sculpted sandstone mausoleum of moments before had transformed into a sparkling gemstone vault under which brom is untouched face was visible
eragon gazed with yearning at the old man who seemed to be only sleeping
what did you do he asked saphira with awe
i gave him the only gift i could
now time will not ravage him
he can rest in peace for eternity
thank ** put a hand on her side and they left together
riding was extremely painful for eragon his broken ribs prevented them from going faster than a walk and it was impossible for him to breathe deeply without a burst of agony
nevertheless he refused to stop
saphira flew close by her mind linked with his for solace and strength
murtagh rode confidently beside cadoc flowing smoothly with his horse is movements
eragon watched the gray animal for a while
you have a beautiful horse
what is his name
tornac after the man who taught me how to ** murtagh patted the horse is side
he was given to me when he was just a foal
you d be hard pressed to find a more courageous and intelligent animal in all of alagaesia saphira excepted of course
