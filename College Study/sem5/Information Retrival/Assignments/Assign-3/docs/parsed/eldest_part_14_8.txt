an incredible variety was on display from puffy white mushrooms the size of eragon is fist to ones he could have mistaken for gnarled bark to delicate toadstools sliced neatly in half to showcase their blue flesh
then the centerpiece of the feast was revealed a gigantic roasted boar glistening with sauce
at least eragon thought it was a boar for the carcass was as large as snowfire and took six dwarves to carry
the tusks were longer than his forearms the snout as wide as his head
and the smell it overwhelmed all others in pungent waves that made his eyes water from their strength
nagra whispered orik
giant boar
undin truly honors you tonight eragon
only the bravest dwarves dare hunt nagran and it is only served to those who have great valor
also i think he makes a gesture that he will support you over durgrimst nagra
eragon leaned toward him so no one else could hear
then this is another animal native to the beors what are the rest
forest wolves big enough to prey on a nagra and nimble enough to catch feldunost
cave bears which we call urzhadn and the elves call beorn and for which they dubbed these peaks though we do not call them such ourselves
the mountains name is a secret that we share with no race
and
smer voth commanded undin smiling at his guests
the servants immediately drew small curved knives and cut portions of the nagra which they set on everyone is plates except for arya is including a weighty piece for saphira
undin smiled again took a dagger and sliced off a bit of his meat
eragon reached for his own knife but orik grabbed his arm
wait
undin chewed slowly rolling his eyes and nodding in an exaggerated fashion then swallowed and proclaimed ilf **
now said orik turning to the meal as conversation erupted along the tables
eragon had never tasted anything like the boar
it was juicy soft and oddly spicy as if the meat had been soaked in honey and cider which was enhanced by the mint used to flavor the ** wonder how they managed to cook something so large
very slowly commented saphira nibbling on her nagra
between bites orik explained it is custom from days when poisoning was rampant among clans for the host to taste the food first and declare it safe for his guests
during the banquet eragon divided his time between sampling the multitude of dishes and conversing with orik arya and dwarves farther down the table
in that manner the hours hastened by for the feast was so large it was late afternoon before the last course had been served the last bite consumed and the last chalice drained
as servants removed the tableware undin turned to eragon and said the meal pleased you yes
undin nodded
i am glad you enjoyed it
i had the tables moved outside yesterday so the dragon might dine with ** he remained intently focused on eragon all the while he spoke
eragon went cold inside
intentionally or not undin had treated saphira as no more than a beast
eragon had intended to ask about the veiled dwarves in private but now out of a desire to unsettle undin he said saphira and i thank ** then sir why was the ring thrown at us
a painful silence crept over the courtyard
out of the corner of his eye eragon saw orik wince
arya however smiled as if she understood what he was doing
undin put down his dagger scowling thickly
the knurlagn you met are of a tragic clan
before the riders fall they were among the oldest richest families of our kingdom
their doom was sealed though by two mistakes they lived on the western edge of the beor mountains and they volunteered their greatest warriors in vrael is service
anger broke through his voice with sharp cracks
galbatorix and his ever cursed forsworn slaughtered them in your city of uru baen
then they flew on us killing many
of that clan only grimstcarvlorss anhuin and her guards survived
anhuin soon died of grief and her men took the name az sweldn rak anhuin the tears of anhuin covering their faces to remind themselves of their loss and their desire for revenge
eragon is cheeks stung with shame as he fought to keep his face expressionless
so said undin glowering at a pastry they rebuilt the clan over the decades waiting and hunting for recompense
