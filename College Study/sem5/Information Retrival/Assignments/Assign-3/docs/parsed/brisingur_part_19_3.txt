with a swirl of skirts she and the teenager strode away and soon were lost from sight in the maze of identical gray tents
what no marks upon their foreheads eragon asked saphira
elva was unique
i shall not brand anyone else in a like manner
what happened in farthen dur just
happened
instinct drove me
beyond that i cannot explain
as the three of them walked toward nasuada is pavilion eragon glanced at angela
who were they
her lips quirked
pilgrims on their own quest
that is hardly an answer he complained
it is not my habit to hand out secrets like candied nuts on winter solstice
especially not when they belong to others
he was silent for a few paces
then when someone refuses to tell me a certain piece of information it only makes me that much more determined to find out the truth
i hate being ignorant
for me a question unanswered is like a thorn in my side that pains me every time i move until i can pluck it out
because if that is so you must spend every waking hour in mortal agony for life is full of unanswerable questions
sixty feet from nasuada is pavilion a contingent of pikemen marching through camp blocked their way
while they waited for the warriors to file past eragon shivered and blew on his hands
i wish we had time for a meal
quick as ever angela said it is the magic is not it it has worn you ** he nodded
sticking a hand into one of the pouches that hung from her sash angela pulled out a hard brown lump flecked with shiny flaxseeds
here this will hold you until lunch
she thrust it at him insistent
eat it
you will like it
trust ** as he took the oily lump from between her fingers she grasped his wrist with her other hand and held him in place while she inspected the half inch high calluses on his knuckles
how very clever of you she said
they are as ugly as the warts on a toad but who cares if they help keep your skin intact eh i like this
i like this quite a lot
were you inspired by the dwarves ascudgamln
nothing escapes you does it he asked
let it escape
i only concern myself with things that ** eragon blinked thrown as he often was by her verbal trickery
she tapped a callus with the tip of one of her short fingernails
i would do this myself except that it would catch on the wool when i am spinning or knitting
you knit with your own yarn he said surprised that she would engage in anything so ordinary
of ** it is a wonderful way to relax
besides if i did not where would i get a sweater with dvalar is ward against mad rabbits knit in the liduen kvaedhi across the inside of the chest or a snood that was dyed yellow green and bright pink
she tossed her thick curls
you would be amazed how many magicians have died after being bitten by mad rabbits
it is far more common than you might think
eragon stared at her
do you think she is jesting he asked saphira
she would only answer with another riddle
the pikemen having gone eragon saphira and angela continued toward the pavilion accompanied by solembum who had joined them without eragon noticing
picking her way around piles of dung left by the horses of king orrin is cavalry angela said so tell me aside from your fight with the ra zac did anything terribly interesting happen to you during your trip you know how i love to hear about interesting things
eragon smiled thinking of the spirits that had visited him and arya
however he did not want to discuss them so instead he said since you ask quite a few interesting things happened
for example i met a hermit named tenga living in the ruins of an elf tower
he possessed the most amazing library
in it were seven
angela stopped so abruptly eragon kept walking another three paces before he caught himself and turned back
the witch seemed stunned as if she had taken a hard knock to her head
padding toward her solembum leaned against her legs and gazed upward
angela wet her lips then said are
she coughed once
are you sure his name was tenga
solembum hissed and the hair on his back stood straight out
eragon edged away from the werecat eager to escape the reach of his claws
met him with a bitter laugh angela planted her hands on her hips
