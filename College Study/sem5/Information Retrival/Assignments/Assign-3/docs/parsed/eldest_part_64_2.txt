it would be easy for saphira to dismantle the machines but she dared not fly among the soldiers for fear of an attack by magic
breaking through the varden lines eight soldiers stormed toward saphira jabbing at her with pikes
before eragon could draw zar roc the dwarves and kull eliminated the entire group
a good ** agreed orik with a bloody grin
eragon did not use spells against the engines they would be protected against any conceivable **
extending himself he found the mind of a soldier who tended one of the catapults
though he was sure the soldier was defended by some magician eragon was able to gain dominance over him and direct his actions from afar
he guided the man up to the weapon which was being loaded then had him use his sword to hack at the skein of twisted rope that powered the machine
the rope was too thick to sever before the soldier was dragged away by his comrades but the damage was already done
with a mightycrack the partially wound skein broke sending the arm of the catapult flying backward and injuring several men
his lips curled in a grim smile eragon proceeded to the next catapult and in short order disabled the remainder of the engines
returning to himself eragon became aware of dozens of the varden collapsing around saphira one of du vrangr gata had been overwhelmed
he uttered a dreadful curse and flung himself back along the trail of magic as he searched for the man who cast the fatal spell entrusting the welfare of his body to saphira and his guards
for over an hour eragon hunted galbatorix is magicians but to little avail for they were wily and cunning and did not directly attack him
their reticence puzzled eragon until he tore from the mind of one spellcaster moments before he committed suicide the thought
ordered not to kill you or the dragon
not to kill you or the dragon
that answers my question he said to saphira but whydoes galbatorix still want us alive we ve made it clear we support the varden
before she could respond nasuada appeared before them her face streaked with filth and gore her shield covered with dents blood sheeting down her left leg from a wound on her thigh
eragon she gasped
i need you both of you to fight to show yourselves and embolden the men
to frighten the soldiers
her condition shocked eragon
let me heal you first he cried afraid she might ** should have put more wards around her
** i can wait but we are lost unless you stem the tide of ** her eyes were glazed and empty blank holes in her face
we need
a ** she swayed in her saddle
eragon saluted her with zar roc
you have one my lady
go she said and may what gods there are watch over you
eragon was too high on saphira is back to strike his enemies below so he dismounted and positioned himself by her right paw
to orik and garzhvog he said protect saphira is left side
and whatever you do do not get in our way
no said eragon i wo not
now take your ** as they did he put his hand on saphira is leg and looked her in one clear cut sapphire ** we dance friend of my heart
then he and she merged their identities to a greater degree than ever before vanquishing all differences between them to become a single entity
they bellowed leaped forward and forged a path to the front line
once there eragon could not tell from whose mouth emanated the ravenous jet of flame that consumed a dozen soldiers cooking them in their mail nor whose arm it was that brought zar roc down in an arc cleaving a soldier is helm in half
the metallic scent of blood clogged the air and curtains of smoke wafted over the burning plains alternately concealing and revealing the knots clumps ranks and battalions of thrashing bodies
overhead the carrion birds waited for their meal and the sun climbed in the firmament toward noon
from the minds of those around them eragon and saphira caught glimpses of how they appeared
saphira was always noticed first a great ravening creature with claws and fangs dyed red who slew all in her path with swipes of her paws and lashes of her tail and with billowing waves of flame that engulfed entire platoons of soldiers
