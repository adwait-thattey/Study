eragon is mind churned as he sped on his way
he ran as fast as he could refusing to stop even when his breath came in great gasps
as he pounded down the cold road he cast out with his mind for saphira but she was too far away for him to contact
he thought about what to say to garrow
there was no choice now he would have to reveal saphira
he arrived home panting for air and heart pounding
garrow stood by the barn with the horses
eragon hesitated
should i talk to him now he wo not believe me unless saphira is here i d better find her ** slipped around the farm and into the ** he shouted with his thoughts
i come was the dim reply
through the words he sensed her alarm
he waited impatiently though it was not long before the sound of her wings filled the air
she landed amid a gout of ** happened she queried
he touched her shoulder and closed his eyes
calming his mind he quickly told her what had occurred
when he mentioned the strangers saphira recoiled
she reared and roared deafeningly then whipped her tail over his head
he scrambled back in surprise ducking as her tail hit a snowdrift
bloodlust and fear emanated from her in great sickening ** ** ** murderers
what is wrong he put all of his strength into the words but an iron wall surrounded her mind shielding her thoughts
she let out another roar and gouged the earth with her claws tearing the frozen ** ** garrow will hear
oaths betrayed souls killed eggs ** blood everywhere
**
frantic he blocked out saphira is emotions and watched her tail
when it flicked past him he dashed to her side and grabbed a spike on her back
clutching it he pulled himself into the small hollow at the base of her neck and held on tightly as she reared again
enough ** he bellowed
her stream of thoughts ceased abruptly
he ran a hand over her scales
everything is going to be all ** she crouched and her wings rushed upward
they hung there for an instant then drove down as she flung herself into the sky
eragon yelled as the ground dropped away and they rose above the trees
turbulence buffeted him snatching the breath out of his mouth
saphira ignored his terror and banked toward the spine
underneath he glimpsed the farm and the anora river
his stomach convulsed
he tightened his arms around saphira is neck and concentrated on the scales in front of his nose trying not to vomit as she continued to climb
when she leveled off he gained the courage to glance around
the air was so cold that frost accumulated on his eyelashes
they had reached the mountains faster than he thought possible
from the air the peaks looked like giant razor sharp teeth waiting to slash them to ribbons
saphira wobbled unexpectedly and eragon heaved over her side
he wiped his lips tasting bile and buried his head against her neck
we have to go back he ** strangers are coming to the ** has to be warned
turn ** there was no answer
he reached for her mind but was blocked by a barrier of roiling fear and anger
determined to make her turn around he grimly wormed into her mental armor
he pushed at its weak places undermined the stronger sections and fought to make her listen but to no avail
soon mountains surrounded them forming tremendous white walls broken by granite cliffs
blue glaciers sat between the summits like frozen rivers
long valleys and ravines opened beneath them
he heard the dismayed screech of birds far below as saphira soared into view
he saw a herd of woolly goats bounding from ledge to ledge on a rocky bluff
eragon was battered by swirling gusts from saphira is wings and whenever she moved her neck he was tossed from side to side
she seemed tireless
he was afraid she was going to fly through the night
finally as darkness fell she tilted into a shallow dive
he looked ahead and saw that they were headed for a small clearing in a valley
saphira spiraled down leisurely drifting over the treetops
she pulled back as the ground neared filled her wings with air and landed on her rear legs
her powerful muscles rippled as they absorbed the shock of impact
she dropped to all fours and skipped a step to keep her balance
