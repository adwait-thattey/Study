his long black hair was in a queue
eragon felt his lips tighten in a grimace of hate he had to struggle to keep from drawing zar roc and attacking
yet despite himself he could not help but admire the urgal is courage in confronting an entire army of enemies alone and unarmed
to his surprise he found the kull is mind strongly shielded
when the urgal stopped before the eaves of the pavilion not daring to come any closer nasuada had her guards shout for quiet to settle the crowd
everyone looked at the urgal wondering what he would do next
the urgal lifted his bulging arms toward the sky inhaled a mighty breath and then opened his maw and bellowed at nasuada
in an instant a thicket of swords pointed at the kull but he paid them no attention and continued his ululation until his lungs were empty
then he looked at nasuada ignoring the hundreds of people who it was obvious longed to kill him and growled in a thick guttural accent what treachery is this lady nightstalker i was promised safe passage
do humans break their word so easily
leaning toward her one of nasuada is commanders said let us punish him mistress for his insolence
once we have taught him the meaning of respect then you can hear his message whatever it is
eragon longed to remain silent but he knew his duty to nasuada and the varden so he bent down and said in nasuada is ear do not take offense
this is how they greet their war chiefs
the proper response is to then butt heads but i do not think you want to try that
did the elves teach you this she murmured never taking her eyes off the waiting kull
what else did they teach you of the urgals
a great deal he admitted reluctantly
then nasuada said to the kull and also to her men beyond the varden are not liars like galbatorix and the empire
speak your mind you need fear no danger while we hold council under the conditions of truce
the urgal grunted and raised his bony chin higher baring his throat eragon recognized it as a gesture of friendship
to lower one is head was a threat in their race for it meant that an urgal intended to ram you with his horns
i am nar garzhvog of the bolvek tribe
i speak for my ** it seemed as if he chewed on each word before spitting it out
urgals are hated more than any other race
elves dwarves humans all hunt us burn us and drive us from our halls
not without good reason pointed out nasuada
garzhvog nodded
not without reason
our people love war
yet how often are we attacked just because you find us as ugly as we find you we have thrived since the fall of the riders
our tribes are now so large the harsh land we live in can no longer feed us
so you made a pact with galbatorix
aye lady nightstalker
he promised us good land if we killed his enemies
he tricked us though
his flame haired shaman durza bent the minds of our war chiefs and forced our tribes to work together as is not our way
when we learned this in the dwarves hollow mountain the herndall the dams who rule us sent my brood mate to galbatorix to ask why he used us ** garzhvog shook his ponderous head
she did not return
our finest rams died for galbatorix then he abandoned us like a broken sword
he isdrajl and snake tongued and a lack horned betrayer
lady nightstalker we are fewer now but we will fight with you if you let us
what is the price asked nasuada
your herndall must want something in return
blood
galbatorix is blood
and if the empire falls we ask that you give us land land for breeding and growing land to avoid more battles in the future
eragon guessed nasuada is decision by the set of her face even before she spoke
so apparently did jormundur for he leaned toward her and said in an undertone nasuada you can not do this
it goes against nature
nature can not help us defeat the empire
weneed allies
the men will desert before they will fight with urgals
that can be worked around
eragon will they keep their word
only so long as we share a common enemy
with a sharp nod nasuada again lifted her voice very well nar garzhvog
you and your warriors may bivouac along the eastern flank of our army away from the main body and we shall discuss the terms of our pact
