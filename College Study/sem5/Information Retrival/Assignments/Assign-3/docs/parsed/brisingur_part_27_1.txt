then eragon felt saphira enter his mind
she swept through his dreams like a great wind brushing aside his looming nightmare
in the silence that followed she whispered all is well little one
rest easy you are safe and i am with you
rest easy
a sense of profound peace crept over eragon
he rolled over and drifted off into happier memories comforted by his awareness of saphira is presence
she yawned again and stretched like a cat
eragon bathed shaved with magic cleaned the falchion is scabbard of dried blood from the previous day and then dressed in one of his elf tunics
once he was satisfied he was presentable and saphira had finished her tongue bath they walked to nasuada is pavilion
all six of the current shift of nighthawks were standing outside their seamed faces set into their usual grim expressions
eragon waited while
stocky dwarf announced them
then he entered the tent and saphira crawled around to the open panel where she could insert her head and participate in the discussion
eragon bowed to nasuada where she sat in her high backed chair carved with blooming thistles
my lady you asked me to come here to talk about my future you said you had a most important mission for me
i did and i do said nasuada
please be ** she indicated a folding chair next to eragon
tilting the sword at his waist so it would not catch he settled into the chair
as you know galbatorix has sent battalions to the cities of aroughs feinster and belatona in an attempt to prevent us from taking them by siege or failing that to slow our progress and force us to divide our own troops so we would be more vulnerable to the depredations of the soldiers who were camped north of us
after yesterday is battle our scouts reported that the last of galbatorix is men withdrew to parts unknown
i was going to strike at those soldiers days ago but i had to refrain since you were absent
without you murtagh and thorn could have slaughtered our warriors with impunity and we had no way of discovering whether the two of them were among the soldiers
now that you are with us again our position is somewhat improved although not as much as i had hoped given that we must now also contend with galbatorix is latest artifice these men without pain
our only encouragement is that the two of you along with islanzadi is spellcasters have proved you can fend off murtagh and thorn
upon that hope depends our plan for victory
that red runt is no match for me said saphira
if he did not have murtagh protecting him i would trap him against the ground and shake him by the neck until he submitted to me and acknowledged me as leader of the hunt
i am sure you would said nasuada smiling
eragon asked what course of action have you decided upon then
i have decided upon several courses and we must undertake them all simultaneously if any are to be successful
first we cannot push farther into the empire leaving cities behind us that gal batorix still controls
to do that would be to expose ourselves to attacks from both the front and the rear and to invite galbatorix to invade and seize surda while we were absent
so i have already ordered the varden to march north to the nearest place where we can safely cross the jiet river
once we are on the other side of the river i will send warriors south to capture aroughs while king orrin and i continue with the remainder of our forces to feinster which with your help and saphira is should fall before us without too much trouble
while we are engaged in the tedious business of tramping across the countryside i have other responsibilities for you ** she leaned forward in her seat
we need the full help of the dwarves
the elves are fighting for us in the north of alagaesia the surdans have joined with us body and mind and even the urgals have allied themselves with us
but we need the dwarves
we cannot succeed without them
especially now that we must contend with soldiers who cannot feel pain
have the dwarves chosen a new king or queen yet
nasuada grimaced
narheim assures me that the process is moving apace but like the elves dwarves take a longer view of time than we do
