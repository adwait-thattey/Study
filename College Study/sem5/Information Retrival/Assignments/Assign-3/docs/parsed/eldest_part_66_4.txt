he waited too long though for the rider muttered a few indecipherable words and within the span of three seconds the dragon is injury was healed
eragon shivered with ** could he do that so quickly and with such a short spell still whoever he might be the new rider certainly was not galbatorix whose dragon was black
eragon clung to that knowledge as he stepped forward to confront the rider
as they met in the center of the plateau saphira and the red dragon circled in the background
the rider grasped his sword with both hands and swung it over his head toward eragon who lifted zar roc to defend himself
their blades collided with a burst of crimson sparks
then eragon shoved back his opponent and started a complex series of blows
he stabbed and parried dancing on light feet as he forced the steel clad rider to retreat toward the edge of the plateau
when they reached the edge the rider held his ground fending off eragon is attacks no matter how ** is as if he can anticipate my every move thought eragon frustrated
if he were rested it would have been easy for him to defeat the rider but as it was he could make no headway
the rider did not have the speed and strength of an elf but his technical skill was better than vanir is and as good as eragon is
eragon felt a touch of panic when his initial surge of energy began to subside and he had accomplished nothing more than a slight scratch across the rider is gleaming breastplate
the last reserves of power stored in zar roc is ruby and the belt of beloth the wise were only enough to maintain his exertions for another minute
then the rider took a step forward
then another
and before eragon knew it they had returned to the center of the plateau where they stood facing each other exchanging blows
zar roc grew so heavy in his hand eragon could barely lift it
his shoulder burned he gasped for breath and sweat poured off his face
not even his desire to avenge hrothgar could help him to overcome his exhaustion
at last eragon slipped and fell
determined not to be killed lying down he rolled back onto his feet and stabbed at the rider who knocked aside zar roc with a lazy flick of his wrist
the way the rider flourished his sword afterward spinning it in a quick circle by his side suddenly seemed familiar to eragon as did all his preceding swordsmanship
he stared with growing horror at his enemy is hand and a half sword then back up at the eye slits of his mirrored helm and shouted i know **
he threw himself at the rider trapping both swords between their bodies hooked his fingers underneath the helm and ripped it off
and there in the center of the plateau on the edge of the burning plains of alagaesia stood murtagh
