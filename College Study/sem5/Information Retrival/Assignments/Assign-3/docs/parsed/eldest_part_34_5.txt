every race has evolved their own system of writing the ancient language
the dwarves use their runic alphabet as do humans
they are only makeshift techniques though and are incapable of expressing the language is true subtleties as well as our liduen kvaedhi the poetic script
the liduen kvaedhi was designed to be as elegant beautiful and precise as possible
it is composed of forty two different shapes that represent various sounds
these shapes can be combined in a nearly infinite range of glyphs that represent both individual words and entire phrases
the symbol on your ring is one such glyph
the symbol on zar roc is another
let us start what are the basic vowel sounds of the ancient language
eragon is ignorance of the underpinnings of the ancient language quickly became apparent
when he had traveled with brom the old storyteller had concentrated on having eragon memorize lists of words that he might need to survive as well as perfecting his pronunciation
in those two areas he excelled but he could not even explain the difference between a definite and indefinite article
if the gaps in his education frustrated oromis the elf did not betray it through word or action but labored persistently to mend them
at a certain point during the lesson eragon commented i ve never needed very many words in my spells brom said it was a gift that i could do so much with justbrisingr
i think the most i ever said in the ancient language was when i spoke to arya in her mind and when i blessed an orphan in farthen dur
you blessed a child in the ancient language asked oromis suddenly alert
do you remember how you worded this blessing
recite it for ** eragon did so and a look of pure horror engulfed oromis
he exclaimed you usedskolir ** are you sure was not itskoliro
eragon frowned
no skolir
why should not i have used it skolir meansshielded
and may you be shielded from ** it was a good blessing
that was no blessing but a ** oromis was more agitated than eragon had ever seen him
the suffixo forms the past tense of verbs ending withr andi
skoliro meansshielded butskolir meansshield
what you said was may luck and happiness follow you and may you be ashield from ** instead of protecting this child from the vagaries of fate you condemned her to be a sacrifice for others to absorb their misery and suffering so that they might live in peace
no ** it can not ** recoiled from the possibility
the effect a spell has is not only determined by the word is sense but also by your intent and i did not intend to harm
you cannot gainsay a word is inherent nature
twist it yes
guide it yes
but not contravene its definition to imply the very ** oromis pressed his fingers together and stared at the table his lips reduced to a flat white line
i will trust that you didnot mean harm else i would refuse to teach you further
if you were honest and your heart was pure then this blessing may cause less evil than i fear though it will still be the nucleus of more pain than either of us could wish
violent trembling overtook eragon as he realized what he had done to the child is life
it may not undo my mistake he said but perhaps it will alleviate it saphira marked the girl on the brow just like she marked my palm with the gedwey ignasia
for the first time in his life eragon witnessed an elf dumbstruck
oromis is gray eyes widened his mouth opened and he clutched the arms of his chair until the wood groaned with protest
one who bears the sign of the riders and yet is not a rider he murmured
in all my years i have never met anyone such as the two of you
every decision you make seems to have an impact far beyond what anyone could anticipate
you change the world with your whims
neither it just is
where is the babe now
it took a moment for eragon to compose his thoughts
with the varden either in farthen dur or surda
do you think that saphira is mark will help her
i know not said oromis
no precedent exists to draw upon for wisdom
there must be ways to remove the blessing to negate a ** eragon was almost pleading
there are
but for them to be most effective you should be the one to apply them and you cannot be spared here
