go now with my blessings while i spread the tidings among the clans
and do not feel bound to wait upon my announcement for no dwarf should be denied this news convey it to all whom you meet
may the halls echo with the jubilation of our race
with one more bow eragon and saphira departed leaving the dwarf king still smiling on his throne
out of the hall eragon told orik what had transpired
the dwarf immediately bent and kissed the floor before saphira
he rose with a grin and clasped eragon is arm saying a wonder indeed
you have given us exactly the hope we needed to combat recent events
there will be drinking tonight i **
orik sobered for a moment
tomorrow yes
but until then we shall not let unhappy thoughts disturb ** **
taking eragon is hand the dwarf pulled him through tronjheim to a great feast hall where many dwarves sat at stone tables
orik leaped onto one scattering dishes across the floor and in a booming voice proclaimed the news of isidar mithrim
eragon was nearly deafened by the cheers and shouts that followed
each of the dwarves insisted on coming to saphira and kissing the floor as orik had
when that was finished they abandoned their food and filled their stone tankards with beer and mead
eragon joined the revelry with an abandon that surprised him
it helped to ease the melancholy gathered in his heart
however he did try to resist complete debauchery for he was conscious of the duties that awaited them the following day and he wanted to have a clear head
even saphira took a sip of mead and finding that she liked it the dwarves rolled out a whole barrel for her
delicately lowering her mighty jaws through the cask is open end she drained it with three long draughts then tilted her head toward the ceiling and belched a giant tongue of flame
it took several minutes for eragon to convince the dwarves that it was safe to approach her again but once he did they brought her another barrel overriding the cook is protests and watched with amazement as she emptied it as well
as saphira became increasingly inebriated her emotions and thoughts washed through eragon with more and more force
it became difficult for him to rely upon the input of his own senses her vision began to slip over his own blurring movement and changing colors
even the odors he smelled shifted at times becoming sharper more pungent
the dwarves began to sing together
weaving as she stood saphira hummed along punctuating each line with a roar
eragon opened his mouth to join in and was shocked when instead of words out came the snarling rasp of a dragon is ** he thought shaking his head is going too far
or am i just drunk he decided it did not matter and proceeded to sing boisterously dragon is voice or not
dwarves continued to stream into the hall as word of isidar mithrim spread
hundreds soon packed the tables with a thick ring around eragon and saphira
orik called in musicians who arranged themselves in a corner where they pulled slipcovers of green velvet off their instruments
soon harps lutes and silver flutes floated their gilded melodies over the throng
many hours passed before the noise and excitement began to calm
when it did orik once more climbed onto the table
he stood there legs spread wide for balance tankard in hand iron bound cap awry and cried hear ** at last we have celebrated as is proper
the urgals are gone the shade is dead and we have ** the dwarves all pounded their tables in approval
it was a good speech short and to the point
but orik was not finished
to eragon and ** he roared lifting the tankard
this too was well received
eragon stood and bowed which brought more cheers
beside him saphira reared and swung a foreleg across her chest attempting to duplicate his move
she tottered and the dwarves realizing their danger scrambled away from her
they were barely in time
with a loud whoosh saphira fell backward landing flat on a banquet table
pain shot through eragon is back and he collapsed insensate by her tail
