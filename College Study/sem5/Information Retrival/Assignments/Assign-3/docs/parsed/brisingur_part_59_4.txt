neither eragon nor arya wanted to risk being killed by a ward they were as yet ignorant of
attacking in turns eragon saphira and arya cut stabbed and battered at the bearded spellcaster for nearly a minute
none of their blows touched the man
then at last after only the slightest hint of resistance eragon felt something give way beneath brisingr and the sword continued on its way and lopped off the spellcaster is head
the air in front of eragon shimmered
at the same instant he felt a sudden drain on his strength as his wards defended him from an unknown spell
the assault ceased after a few seconds leaving him dizzy and light headed
his stomach rumbled
he grimaced and fortified himself with energy from the belt of beloth the wise
the only response the other two magicians evinced at the death of their companion was to increase the speed of their invocation
yellow foam encrusted the corners of their mouths and spittle flew from their lips and the whites of their eyes showed but still they made no attempt to flee or to attack
continuing on to the next spellcaster a corpulent man with rings on his thumbs eragon saphira and arya repeated the process they had used on the first magician alternating blows until they succeeded in wearing down his wards
it was saphira who slew the man knocking him through the air with a swipe of her claws
he hit the side of the staircase and cracked open his skull on the corner of a step
this time there was no magical retaliation
as eragon moved toward the female spellcaster a cluster of multicolored lights hurtled into the room through the broken shutters and converged upon the man seated on the floor
the glowing spirits flashed with angry virulence as they whirled around the man forming an impenetrable wall
he threw up his arms as if to shield himself and screamed
the air hummed and crackled with the energy that radiated from the flickering orbs
a sour ironlike taste coated eragon is tongue and his skin prickled
the hair on the female spellcaster is head was standing on end
across from her saphira hissed and arched her back every muscle in her body rigid
a bolt of fear shot through eragon
** he thought feeling sick
not now
not after all we ve gone through
he was stronger than he had been when he faced durza in tronjheim but if anything he was even more aware of just how dangerous a shade could be
only three warriors had ever survived the killing of a shade laetri the elf irnstad the rider and himself and he had no confidence he could duplicate the feat
blodhgarm where are you eragon shouted with his mind
we need your help
and then everything around eragon winked out of existence and in its place he beheld
he flapped once more and the sky water parted before him revealing the glaring scorchback sun and the hazy green brown earth
where is he glaedr wondered
he swung his head looking for thorn
the little red shrike dragon had fled high above gil ead higher than any bird normally flew where the air was thin and one is breath water smoked
glaedr twisted but he was too slow
the red dragon crashed into his right shoulder knocking him tumbling
snarling glaedr wrapped his single remaining foreleg around the nipping scratching ferocious hatchling and strove to crush the life out of thorn is squirming body
the red dragon bellowed and climbed halfway out of glaedr is embrace digging his claws into glaedr is chest
glaedr arched his neck and sank his teeth into thorn is left hind leg and with it held him in place although the red dragon writhed and kicked like a pinned wildcat
hot salty blood filled glaedr is mouth
as they plummeted downward glaedr heard the sound of swords striking shields as oromis and murtagh exchanged a flurry of blows
thorn convulsed and glaedr glimpsed morzan son murtagh
glaedr thought the human appeared frightened but he was not entirely sure
even after so long bonded with oromis he still had difficulty deciphering the expressions of two legs no horns what with their soft flat faces and their lack of tails
the clanging of metal ceased and murtagh shouted curse you for not showing yourself ** curse ** you could have helped ** you could have murtagh seemed to choke on his tongue for a moment
