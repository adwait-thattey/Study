we call ourselves du vrangr gata or the
the wandering path i know interrupted eragon remembering what angela had said about it
your knowledge of the ancient language is impressive said a twin smoothly
as we were saying du vrangr gata has heard of your mighty feats and we have come to extend an invitation of membership
we would be honored to have one of your stature as a member
and i suspect that we might be able to assist you as well
the other twin said the two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters
we could guide you
show you spells we ve discovered and teach you words of power
nothing would gladden us more than if we could assist in some small way your path to glory
no repayment would be necessary though if you saw fit to share some scraps of your own knowledge we would be satisfied
eragon is face hardened as he realized what they were asking for
do you think i am a half wit he demanded harshly
i wo not apprentice myself to you so you can learn the words brom taught ** it must have angered you when you could not steal them from my mind
the twins abruptly dropped their facade of smiles
we are not to be trifled with ** we are the ones who will test your abilities with magic
and that could bemost unpleasant
remember it only takes one misconceived spell to kill someone
you may be a rider but the two of us are still stronger than you
eragon kept his face expressionless even as his stomach knotted painfully
i will consider your offer but it may
then we will expect your answer tomorrow
make sure that it is the right ** they smiled coldly and stalked deeper into the library
eragon ** am not going to join du vrangr gata no matter what they do
you should talk to angela said ** is dealt with the twins before
perhaps she could be there when they test you
that might prevent them from harming you
that is a good ** wound through the bookcases until he found orik sitting on a bench busily polishing his war ax
i d like to return to the dragonhold
the dwarf slid the haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt then escorted eragon to the gate where saphira waited
people had already gathered around her
ignoring them eragon scrambled onto saphira is back and they escaped to the sky
this problem must be resolved quickly
you cannot let the twins intimidate you saphira said as she landed on isidar mithrim
i know
but i hope we can avoid angering ** could be dangerous ** dismounted quickly keeping a hand on zar roc
so can you
do you want them as allies
he shook his ** really
i will tell them tomorrow that i wo not join du vrangr gata
eragon left saphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold
he wanted to see angela but he did not remember how to find her hiding place and solembum was not there to guide him
he roamed the deserted corridors hoping to meet angela by chance
when he grew tired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls he retraced his footsteps to the hold
as he neared it he heard someone speaking within the room
he halted and listened but the clear voice fell ** who is in there
a female
she has an air of command
i will distract her while you come ** loosened zar roc in its ** said that intruders would be kept out of the dragonhold so who could this be he steadied his nerves then stepped into the hold his hand on the sword
a young woman stood in the center of the room looking curiously at saphira who had stuck her head out of the cave
the woman appeared to be about seventeen years old
the star sapphire cast a rosy light on her accentuating skin the same deep shade as ajihad is
her velvet dress was wine red and elegantly cut
a jeweled dagger worn with use hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath
eragon crossed his arms waiting for the woman to notice him
she continued to look at saphira then curtsied and asked sweetly please could you tell me where rider eragon is saphira is eyes sparkled with amusement
with a small smile eragon said i am here
the woman whirled to face him hand flying to her dagger
her face was striking with almond shaped eyes wide lips and round cheekbones
