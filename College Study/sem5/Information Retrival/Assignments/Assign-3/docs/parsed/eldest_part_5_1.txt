eragon roused himself and rolled to the edge of the bed looking about the room which was suffused with the dim glow of a shuttered lantern
he sat and watched saphira sleep
her muscled sides expanded and contracted as the great bellows of her lungs forced air through her scaled nostrils
eragon thought of the raging inferno that she could now summon at will and send roaring out of her maw
it was an awesome sight when flames hot enough to melt metal rushed past her tongue and ivory teeth without harming them
since she first breathed fire during his fight with durza while plunging toward them from the top of tronjheim saphira had been insufferably proud of her new talent
she was constantly releasing little jets of flame and she took every opportunity to light objects ablaze
because isidar mithrim was shattered eragon and saphira had been unable to remain in the dragonhold above it
the dwarves had given them quarters in an old guardroom on tronjheim is bottom level
it was a large room but with a low ceiling and dark walls
anguish gripped eragon as he remembered the events of the previous day
tears filled his eyes spilling over and he caught one on his hand
they had heard nothing from arya until late that evening when she emerged from the tunnel weary and footsore
despite her best efforts and all her magic the urgals had escaped her
i found these she said
then she revealed one of the twins purple robes torn and bloodied and murtagh is tunic and both his leather gauntlets
they were strewn along the edge of a black chasm the bottom of which no tunnel reaches
the urgals must have stolen their armor and weapons and thrown the bodies into the pit
i scryed both murtagh and the twins and saw naught but the shadows of the ** her eyes met eragon is
i am sorry they are gone
now in the confines of his mind eragon mourned murtagh
it was a dreadful creeping feeling of loss and horror made worse by the fact that he had grown ever more familiar with it in past months
as he stared at the tear in his hand a small glistening dome he decided to scry the three men himself
he knew it was a desperate and futile prospect but he had to try in order to convince himself that murtagh was really gone
even so he was uncertain if he wanted to succeed where arya had failed if it would make him feel any better to catch a glimpse of murtagh lying broken at the base of a cliff deep below farthen dur
he whispered draumr ** darkness enveloped the liquid turning it into a small dot of night on his silver palm
movement flickered through it like the swish of a bird across a clouded moon
then nothing
eragon took a deep breath leaned back and let calm settle over him
since recovering from durza is wound he had realized humbling as it was that he had prevailed only through sheer ** i ever face another shade or the ra zac or galbatorix i mustbe stronger if i expect to win
brom could have taught me more i know he could have
but without him i have but one choice the elves
saphira is breathing quickened and she opened her eyes yawning ** morning little one
is it he looked down and leaned on his hands compressing the ** is terrible
murtagh and ajihad
why did not sentries in the tunnels warn us of the urgals they should not have been able to trail ajihad is group without being noticed
arya was right it does not make sense
we may never know the truth said saphira gently
she stood wings brushing the ** need to eat then we must discover what the varden are planning
we can not waste time a new leader could be chosen within hours
eragon agreed thinking of how they had left everyone yesterday orik rushing off to give king hrothgar the tidings jormundur taking ajihad is body to a place where it would rest until the funeral and arya who stood alone and watched the goings on
eragon rose and strapped on zar roc and his bow then bent and lifted snowfire is saddle
a line of pain sheared through his torso driving him to the floor where he writhed scrabbling at his back
it felt like he was being sawed in half
saphira growled as the ripping sensation reached her
