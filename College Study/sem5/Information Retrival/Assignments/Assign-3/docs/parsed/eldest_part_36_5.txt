without turning around she asked have you received copies of our latest reports from the empire
i ** he joined her at the window
that they re too meager and incomplete to extract any meaningful conclusions
they re the best we have though
give me your suspicions and your hunches
extrapolate from the known facts like you would if this were one of your ** she smiled to herself
i promise that i wo not attach meaning to what you say
she had to wait for his reply and when it came it was with the dolorous weight of a doomsday prophecy
increased taxes emptied garrisons horses and oxen confiscated throughout the empire
it seems that galbatorix gathers his forces in preparation to confront us though i cannot tell whether he means to do it in offense or ** revolving shadows cooled their faces as a cloud of starlings whirled across the sun
the question that weighs upon my mind now is how long will it take him to mobilize for that will determine the course of our strategies
weeks
months
years
i cannot predict his actions
he nodded
have your agents continued to spread tidings of eragon
it has become increasingly dangerous but yes
my hope is that if we inundate cities like dras leona with rumors of eragon is prowess when we actually reach the city and they see him they will join us of their own accord and we can avoid a siege
she let the comment pass uncontested
and how fares the mobilization of your own army the varden as always are ready to fight
orrin spread his hands in a placating gesture
it is difficult to rouse a nation nasuada
there are nobles who i must convince to back me armor and weapons to be constructed supplies to be gathered
and in the meantime how do i feed my people we need more land than you allotted us
well i know it he said
and we will only get it by invading the empire unless you fancy making the varden a permanent addition to surda
if so you will have to find homes for the thousands of people i brought from farthen dur which wo not please your existing citizens
whatever your choice choose quickly because i fear that if you continue to procrastinate the varden will disintegrate into an uncontrollable ** she tried not to make it sound like a threat
nevertheless orrin obviously did not appreciate the insinuation
his upper lip curled and he said your father never let his men get out of hand
i trust you wo not either if you expect to remain leader of the varden
as for our preparations there is a limit to what we can do in so short a time you will just have to wait until we are ready
she gripped the windowsill until veins stood out on her wrists and her fingernails sank into the crevices between the stones yet she allowed none of her anger to color her voice in that case will you lend the varden more gold for food
no
i ve given you all the money i can spare
i would suggest that you raise the funds yourself
furious she gave him her widest brightest smile holding it long enough to make him shift with unease and then curtsied as deeply as a servant never letting her demented grimace waver
farewell then sire
i hope that the rest of your day is as enjoyable as our conversation was
orrin muttered an unintelligible response as she swept back to the laboratory is entrance
in her anger nasuada caught her right sleeve on a jade bottle and knocked it over cracking the stone and releasing a flood of yellow liquid that splattered her sleeve and soaked her skirt
she flicked her wrist in annoyance without stopping
farica rejoined her in the stairwell and together they traversed the warren of passageways to nasuada is chambers
