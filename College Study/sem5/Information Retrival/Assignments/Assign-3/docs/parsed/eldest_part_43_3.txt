and vanir is companions who as best eragon could tell were of a younger generation of elves shared his veiled distaste for eragon though they never displayed aught but respect for saphira
their rivalry came to a head when after defeating eragon six times in a row vanir lowered his sword and said dead yet again shadeslayer
how repetitive
do you wish to continue his tone indicated that he thought it would be pointless
aye grunted eragon
he had already suffered an episode with his back and was in no mood to bandy words
still when vanir said tell me as i am curious how did you kill durza when you are so slow i cannot fathom how you managed it eragon felt compelled to reply i caught him by surprise
forgive me i should have guessed trickery was involved
eragon fought the impulse to grind his teeth
if i were an elf or you a human you would not be able to match my blade
perhaps said vanir
he assumed his ready position and within the span of three seconds and two blows disarmed eragon
but i think not
you should not boast to a better swordsman else he may decide to punish your temerity
eragon is temper broke then and he reached deep within himself and into the torrent of magic
he released the pent up energy with one of the twelve minor words of binding crying ** to chain vanir is legs and arms in place and hold his jaw shut so that he could not utter a counterspell
the elf is eyes bulged with outrage
eragon said and you should not boast to one who is more skilled in magic than you
without warning or a whisper of a sound an invisible force clouted eragon on the chest and threw him ten yards across the grass where he landed upon his side driving the wind from his lungs
the impact disrupted eragon is control of the magic and freed vanir
advancing upon him vanir said your ignorance betrays you human
you do not know whereof you speak
to think that you were chosen to succeed vrael that you were given his quarters that you have had the honor to serve the mourning sage
he shook his head
it sickens me that such gifts are bestowed upon one so unworthy
you do not even understand what magic is or how it works
eragon is anger resurged like a crimson tide
what he said have i ever done to wrong you why do you despise me so would you prefer it if no rider existed to oppose galbatorix
my opinions are of little consequence
i agree but i would hear them
listening as nuala wrote inconvocations is the path to wisdom only when the result of a conscious decision and not a void of perception
straighten your tongue vanir and give me an honest **
vanir smiled coldly
as you command o ** drawing near so that only eragon could hear his soft voice the elf said for eighty years after the fall of the riders we held no hope of victory
we survived by hiding ourselves through deceit and magic which is but a temporary measure for eventually galbatorix will be strong enough to march upon us and sweep aside our defenses
then long after we had resigned ourselves to our fate brom and jeod rescued saphira is egg and once again a chance existed to defeat the foul usurper
imagine our joy and celebration
we knew that in order to withstand galbatorix the new rider had to be more powerful than any of his predecessors more powerful than even vrael
yet how was our patience rewarded with another human like galbatorix
worse
a cripple
you doomed us all eragon the instant you touched saphira is egg
do not expect us to welcome your ** vanir touched his lips with his first and second finger then sidestepped eragon and walked off the sparring field leaving eragon rooted in place
he is right thought ** am ill suited for this task
any of these elves even vanir would make a better rider than me
emanating outrage saphira broadened the contact between ** you think so little of my judgment eragon you forget that when i was in my egg arya exposed me to each and every one of these elves as well as many of the varden is children and that i rejected them all
i would not have chosen someone to be my rider unless they could help your race mine and the elves for the three of us share an intertwined fate
