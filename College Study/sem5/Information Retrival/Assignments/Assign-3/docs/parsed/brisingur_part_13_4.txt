it was impossible to determine their ages for their faces were smooth and unlined
they were the first elves besides arya that nasuada had met in person and she was eager to find out if arya was representative of her race
touching his first two fingers to his lips the lead elf bowed as did his companions and then twisted his right hand against his chest and said greetings and felicitations nasuada daughter of ajihad
atra esterni onto ** his accent was more pronounced than arya is a lilting cadence that gave his words music
atra du evarinya ono varda replied nasuada as arya had taught her
the elf smiled revealing teeth that were sharper than normal
i am blodhgarm son of ildrid the ** he introduced the other elves in turn before continuing
we bring you glad tidings from queen islanzadi last night our spellcasters succeeded in destroying the gates of ceunon
even as we speak our forces advance through the streets toward the tower where lord tarrant has barricaded himself
some few still resist us but the city has fallen and soon we shall have complete control over ceunon
nasuada is guards and the varden gathered behind her burst into cheers at the news
she too rejoiced at the victory but then a sense of foreboding and disquiet tempered her celebratory mood as she pictured elves especially ones as strong as blodhgarm invading human homes
what unearthly forces have i unleashed she wondered
these are glad tidings indeed she said and i am well pleased to hear them
with ceunon captured we are that much closer to uru baen and thus to galbatorix and the fulfillment of our ** in a more private voice she said i trust that queen islanzadi will be gentle with the people of ceunon with those who have no love for galbatorix but lack the means or the courage to oppose the empire
queen islanzadi is both kind and merciful to her subjects even if they are her unwilling subjects but if anyone dares oppose us we shall sweep them aside like dead leaves before an autumn storm
i would expect nothing less from a race as old and mighty as yours nasuada replied
after satisfying the demands of courtesy with several more polite exchanges of increasing triviality nasuada deemed it appropriate to address the reason for the elves visit
she ordered the assembled crowd to disperse then said your purpose here as i understand it is to protect eragon and saphira
am i right
you are nasuada svit kona
and we are aware that eragon is still inside the empire but that he will return soon
are you also aware that arya left in search of him and that they are now traveling together
blodhgarm flicked his ears
we were informed of that as well
it is unfortunate that they should both be in such danger but hopefully no harm will befall them
what do you intend to do then will you seek them out and escort them back to the varden or will you stay and wait and trust that eragon and arya can defend themselves against galbatorix is minions
we will remain as your guests nasuada daughter of ajihad
eragon and arya are safe enough as long as they avoid detection
joining them in the empire could very well attract unwanted attention
under the circumstances it seems best to bide our time where we can yet do some good
galbatorix is most likely to strike here at the varden and if he does and if thorn and murtagh should reappear saphira will need all our help to drive them off
nasuada was surprised
eragon said you were among the strongest spellcasters of your race but do you really have the wherewithal to thwart that accursed pair like galbatorix they have powers far beyond those of ordinary riders
with saphira helping us yes we believe that we can match or overcome thorn and murtagh
we know what the forsworn were capable of and while galbatorix has probably made thorn and murtagh stronger than any individual member of the forsworn he certainly wo not have made them his equals
in that regard at least his fear of treachery is to our benefit
even three of the forsworn could not conquer the twelve of us and a dragon
therefore we are confident that we can hold our own against all but galbatorix
