what will your prospective mates think when they hear of this will you tell them
yarbog drowned out roran is words with a roar
the urgal sprinted toward him turning slightly so as to crash into roran with his full weight
skipping out of the way roran reached out for the tip of yarbog is right horn but missed his mark and fell stumbling into the middle of the square skinning both knees
he cursed to himself as he regained his footing
checking his headlong rush just before momentum carried him beyond the boundaries of the square yarbog turned back his small yellow eyes searching for roran
** shouted roran
he stuck out his tongue and made every rude gesture he could think of
you could not hit a tree even if it was in front of **
die puny ** yarbog growled and sprang at roran arms outstretched
two of yarbog is nails carved bloody furrows across roran is ribs as roran darted to his left but he still managed to grasp and hang on to one of the urgal is horns
roran grabbed the other horn as well before yarbog could throw him off
using the horns as handles roran wrenched yarbog is head to one side and straining every muscle cast the urgal to the ground
roran is back flared in angry protest at the motion
as soon as yarbog is chest touched the dirt roran placed a knee on top of his right shoulder pinning him in place
yarbog snorted and bucked trying to break roran is grip but roran refused to let go
he braced his feet against a rock and twisted the urgal is head as far around as it would go pulling so hard he would have broken the neck of any human
the grease on his palms made it difficult to hold on to yarbog is horns
yarbog relaxed for a moment then pushed himself off the ground with his left arm lifting roran as well and scrabbled with his legs in an effort to get them underneath his body
roran grimaced and leaned against yarbog is neck and shoulder
after a handful of seconds yarbog is left arm buckled and he fell flat on his stomach again
both roran and yarbog were panting as heavily as if they had run a race
where they touched the bristles on the urgal is hide poked roran like pieces of stiff wire
dust coated their bodies
thin streams of blood ran down from the scratches on roran is side and from his aching back
yarbog resumed kicking and flailing once he had regained his breath flopping around in the dirt like a hooked fish
it took all of roran is strength but he hung on trying to ignore the stones that cut his feet and legs
unable to free himself by those methods yarbog let his limbs go limp and then began to flex his neck again and again in an attempt to exhaust roran is arms
they lay there neither of them moving more than a few inches as they struggled against each other
a fly buzzed over them and landed on roran is ankle
after nearly ten minutes sweat drenched roran is face
he could not seem to get enough air into his lungs
his arms seared with agony
the stripes on his back felt as if they were about to tear asunder
his ribs throbbed where yarbog had clawed him
roran knew he could not continue for much longer
blast ** he thought
wo not he ever give up
just then yarbog is head quivered as a muscle in the urgal is neck cramped
yarbog grunted the first sound he had made in over a minute and in an undertone he muttered kill me stronghammer
i cannot best you
adjusting his grip on yarbog is horns roran growled in an equally low tone no
if you want to die find someone else to kill you
i have fought by your rules now you will accept defeat according to mine
tell everyone that you submit to me
say you were wrong to challenge me
do that and i will let you go
if not i will keep you here until you change your mind no matter how long it takes
yarbog is head twitched under roran is hands as the urgal tried once more to free himself
he huffed blowing a small cloud of dust into the air then rumbled the shame would be too great stronghammer
kill me
i do not belong to your race and i wo not abide by your customs said roran
if you are so worried about your honor tell those who are curious that you were defeated by the cousin of eragon shadeslayer
