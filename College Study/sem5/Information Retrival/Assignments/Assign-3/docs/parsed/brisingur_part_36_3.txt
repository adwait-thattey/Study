that is good of you shadeslayer
you have done much for our race and whichever clan it was attacked you we shall turn against them and have our vengeance
i swore before witnesses eragon said and i swear to you as well that i will punish whoever sent those backstabbing murderers and that i will make them wish they had never thought of such a foul deed
however
eragon hesitated then inclined his head
however we must not do anything that would ignite a clan war
not now
if force is to be used it should be grimstborith orik who decides when and where we draw our swords do not you agree
i will think upon what you have said shadeslayer glumra replied
orik is
whatever she was going to say next caught in her mouth
her thick eyelids drooped and she sagged forward for a moment pressing her maimed hand against her abdomen
when the bout passed she pushed herself upright and held the back of the hand against her opposite cheek and swayed from side to side moaning oh mine son
mine beautiful son
standing she staggered around the table heading toward a small collection of swords and axes mounted on the wall behind eragon next to an alcove covered by a curtain of red silk
afraid that she intended to cause herself further injury eragon leaped to his feet knocking over the oak chair in his haste
he reached for her and then saw that she was walking toward the curtained alcove not the weapons and he snatched his arm back before he caused offense
the brass rings sewn on top of the silk drapery clattered against one another as glumra swept aside the cloth to expose a deep shadowed shelf carved with runes and shapes of such fantastic detail eragon thought he could stare at them for hours and still not grasp them in their entirety
on the low shelf rested statues of the six major dwarf gods as well as nine other entities eragon was unfamiliar with all carved with exaggerated features and postures to better convey the character of the being portrayed
glumra removed an amulet of gold and silver from within her bodice which she kissed and then held against the hollow of her throat as she knelt before the alcove
her voice rising and falling in the strange patterns of dwarf music she began to croon a dirge in her native language
the melody brought tears to eragon is eyes
for several minutes glumra sang and then she fell silent and continued to gaze at the figurines and as she gazed the lines of her grief ravaged face softened and where before eragon had perceived only anger distress and hopelessness her countenance assumed an air of calm acceptance of peacefulness and of sublime transcendence
a soft glow seemed to emanate from her features
so complete was glumra is transformation eragon almost did not recognize her
she said tonight kvistor will dine in morgothal is hall
that i ** she kissed her amulet again
i wish i might break bread with him along with mine husband bauden but it is not mine time to sleep in the catacombs of tronjheim and morgothal refuses entry to his hall to those who quicken their arrival
but in time our family shall be reunited including all of our ancestors since guntera created the world from darkness
that i know
eragon knelt next to her and in a hoarse voice he asked how do you know this
i know because it is ** her movements slow and respectful glumra touched the chiseled feet of each of the gods with the tips of her fingers
how could it be otherwise since the world could not have created itself any more than a sword or a helm might and since the only beings with the wherewithal to forge the earth and the heavens into shape are those with divine power it is to the gods we must look for our answers
them i trust to ensure the rightness of the world and by mine trust i free myself of the burdens of mine flesh
she spoke with such conviction eragon felt a sudden desire to share in her belief
he longed to toss aside his doubts and fears and to know that however horrible the world might seem at times life was not mere confusion
he wished to know for certain that who he was would not end if a sword should shear off his head and that one day he would meet again with brom garrow and everyone else he had cared for and lost
