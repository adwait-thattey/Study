the moment the sun appeared over the tree lined horizon eragon deepened his breathing willed his heart to quicken and opened his eyes as he returned to full awareness
he had not been asleep for he had not slept since his transformation
when he felt weary and lay himself down to rest he entered a state that was unto a waking dream
there he beheld many wondrous visions and walked among the gray shades of his memories yet all the while remained aware of his surroundings
he watched the sunrise and thoughts of arya filled his mind as they had every hour since the agaeti blodhren two days before
the morning after the celebration he had gone looking for her in tialdari hall intending to try and make amends for his behavior only to discover that she had already left for ** will i see her again he wondered
in the clear light of day he had realized just how much the elves and dragons magic had dulled his wits during the agaeti ** may have acted a fool but it was not entirely my fault
i was no more responsible for my conduct than if i were drunk
still he had meant every word he said to arya even if normally he would not have revealed so much of himself
her rejection cut eragon to the quick
freed of the enchantments that had clouded his mind he was forced to admit that she was probably right that the difference between their ages was too great to overcome
it was a difficult thing for him to accept and once he had the knowledge only increased his anguish
eragon had heard the expression heartbroken before
until then he always considered it a fanciful description not an actual physical symptom
but now he felt a deep ache in his chest like that of a sore muscle and each beat of his heart pained him
his only comfort was saphira
in those two days she had never criticized what he had done nor did she leave his side for more than a few minutes at a time lending him the support of her companionship
she talked to him a great deal as well doing her best to draw him out of his shell of silence
to keep himself from brooding over arya eragon took orik is puzzle ring from his nightstand and rolled it between his fingers marveling at how keen his senses had become
he could feel every flaw in the twisted metal
as he studied the ring he perceived a pattern in the arrangement of the gold bands a pattern that had escaped him before
trusting his instinct he manipulated the bands in the sequence suggested by his observation
to his delight the eight pieces fit together perfectly forming a solid whole
he slid the ring onto the fourth finger of his right hand admiring how the woven bands caught the light
you could not do that before observed saphira from the bowl in the floor where she slept
i can see many things that were once hidden to me
eragon went to the wash closet and performed his morning ablutions including removing the stubble from his cheeks with a spell
despite the fact that he now closely resembled an elf he had retained the ability to grow a beard
orik was waiting for them when eragon and saphira arrived at the sparring field
his eyes brightened as eragon lifted his hand and displayed the completed puzzle ring
you solved it **
it took me longer than i expected said eragon but yes
are you here to practice as well
eh
i already got in a bit o ax work with an elf who took a rather fiendish delight in cracking me over the head
no
i came to watch you fight
you ve seen me fight before pointed out eragon
not for a while i have not
you mean you re curious to see how i ve ** orik shrugged in response
vanir approached from across the field
he cried are you ready shadeslayer the elf is condescending demeanor had lessened since their last duel before the agaeti blodhren but not by much
eragon and vanir squared off against each other in an open area of the field
emptying his mind eragon grasped and drew zar roc as fast as he could
to his surprise the sword felt as if it weighed no more than a willow wand
without the expected resistance eragon is arm snapped straight tearing the sword from his hand and sending it whirling twenty yards to his right where it buried itself in the trunk of a pine tree
