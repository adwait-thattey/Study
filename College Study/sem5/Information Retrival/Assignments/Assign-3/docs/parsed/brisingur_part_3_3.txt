then he dropped to one knee and with an incoherent cry brought the blade down across his right wrist
blood sprayed the rocks behind the altar
eragon winced and averted his eyes although he could not escape the youth is piercing screams
it was nothing eragon had not seen in battle but it seemed wrong to deliberately mutilate yourself when it was so easy to become disfigured in everyday life
blades of grass rasped against one another as roran shifted his weight
he muttered some curse which was lost in his beard and then fell silent again
while a priest tended to the young man is wound stanching the bleeding with a spell an acolyte let loose two slaves from the high priest is litter only to chain them by the ankles to an iron loop embedded in the altar
then the acolytes divested themselves of numerous packages from underneath their robes and piled them on the ground out of reach of the slaves
their ceremonies at an end the priests and their retinue departed helgrind for dras leona wailing and ringing the entire way
the now one handed zealot stumbled along just behind the high priest
a beatific smile graced his face
i ve traveled among both dwarves and elves and nothing they did was ever as strange as what those people those humans do
they re as monstrous as the ra ** roran jerked his chin toward helgrind
can you find out now if katrina is in there
i will try
but be ready to run
closing his eyes eragon slowly extended his consciousness outward moving from the mind of one living thing to another like tendrils of water seeping through sand
he touched teeming cities of insects frantically scurrying about their business lizards and snakes hidden among warm rocks diverse species of songbirds and numerous small mammals
insects and animals alike bustled with activity as they prepared for the fast approaching night whether by retreating to their various dens or in the case of those of a nocturnal bent by yawning stretching and otherwise readying themselves to hunt and forage
just as with his other senses eragon is ability to touch another being is thoughts diminished with distance
by the time his psychic probe arrived at the base of helgrind he could perceive only the largest of animals and even those but faintly
he proceeded with caution ready to withdraw at a second is notice if he happened to brush against the minds of their prey the ra zac and the ra zac is parents and steeds the gigantic lethrblaka
eragon was willing to expose himself in this manner only because none of the ra zac is breed could use magic and he did not believe that they were mindbreakers nonmagicians trained to fight with telepathy
the ra zac and lethrblaka had no need for such tricks when their breath alone could induce a stupor in the largest of men
and though eragon risked discovery by his ghostly investigation he roran and saphira had to know if the ra zac had imprisoned katrina roran is betrothed in helgrind for the answer would determine whether their mission was one of rescue or one of capture and interrogation
eragon searched long and hard
when he returned to himself roran was watching him with the expression of a starving wolf
his gray eyes burned with a mixture of anger hope and despair that was so great it seemed as if his emotions might burst forth and incinerate everything in sight in a blaze of unimaginable intensity melting the very rocks themselves
katrina is father the butcher sloan had betrayed roran to the ra zac
when they failed to capture him the ra zac had instead seized katrina from roran is bedroom and spirited her away from palancar valley leaving the inhabitants of carvahall to be killed and enslaved by king galbatorix is soldiers
unable to pursue katrina roran had just in time convinced the villagers to abandon their homes and to follow him across the spine and then south along the coast of alagaesia where they joined forces with the rebel varden
the hardships they endured as a result had been many and terrible
but circuitous as it was that course had reunited roran with eragon who knew the location of the ra zac is den and had promised to help save katrina
