that is an order strong hammer
you look as if you re about to fall over
as roran started to leave nasuada raised a hand and said ** he paused
now that you have fought these men who feel no pain do you believe that having similar protection from the agonies of the flesh would make it easier to defeat them
roran hesitated then shook his head
their strength is their weakness
they do not shield themselves as they would if they feared the bite of a sword or the stab of an arrow and thus they are careless with their lives
it is true they can continue fighting long past when an ordinary man would have dropped dead and that is no small advantage in battle but they also die in greater numbers because they do not protect their bodies as they ought
in their numb confidence they will walk into traps and peril we would go to great lengths to avoid
as long as the varden is spirits remain high i believe that with the right tactics we can prevail against these laughing monsters
if we were like them though we would hack each other into oblivion and neither of us would care since we would have no thought for self preservation
those are my thoughts
when roran had gone saphira said nothing yet from eragon
nasuada shook her head
no nothing yet from him and his silence is beginning to concern me
if he has not contacted us by the day after tomorrow i will have arya send a message to one of orik is spellcasters demanding a report from him
if eragon is unable to hasten the end of the dwarves clanmeet then i fear we will no longer be able to count on the dwarves as allies during the battles to come
the only good of such a disastrous outcome would be that eragon could return to us without further delay
when saphira was ready to leave the red chrysalis tent blodhgarm again summoned up the apparition of eragon and placed it on saphira is back
then saphira withdrew her head from the confines of the tent and as she had before bounded through the camp the lithe elves keeping step with her the entire way
once she reached eragon is tent and the colored shadow eragon disappeared inside it saphira lowered herself to the ground and resigned herself to waiting out the remainder of the day in unrelieved monotony
before she resumed her reluctant nap however she extended her mind toward roran and katrina is tent and pressed against roran is mind until he lowered the barriers around his consciousness
do you know another such as me
of course not
you just surprised me
i am
ah somewhat occupied at the moment
she studied the color of his emotions as well as those of katrina and was amused by her findings
i only wished to welcome you back
i am glad you were not injured
roran is thoughts flashed quick hot muddled cold and he seemed to have difficulty forming a coherent answer
eventually he said that is very kind of you saphira
if you can come visit me tomorrow when we may speak at greater length
i grow restless sitting here day after day
perhaps you could tell me more about how eragon was before i hatched for him
it
it would be my honor
satisfied she had fulfilled the demands of round ears two legs courtesy by welcoming roran and heartened by the knowledge that the following day would not be as boring for it was unthinkable anyone would dare ignore her request for an audience saphira made herself as comfortable as she could on the bare earth wishing as she often did for the soft nest that was hers in eragon is wind rocked tree house in ellesmera
a puff of smoke escaped her as she sighed and fell asleep and dreamed that she flew higher than she ever had before
she flapped and she flapped until she rose above the unreachable peaks of the beor mountains
there she circled for a time gazing down at the whole of alagaesia laid out before her
then an uncontrollable desire entered her to climb even higher and see what she might and so she began flapping again and in what seemed like the blink of an eye she soared past the glaring moon until only she and the silver stars hung in the black sky
she drifted among the heavens for an indeterminate period queen of the bright jewel like world below but then disquiet entered her soul and she cried out with her thoughts
