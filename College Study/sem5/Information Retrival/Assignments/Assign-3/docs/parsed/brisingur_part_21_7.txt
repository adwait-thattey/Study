jeod shifted on the bed
as a warrior morzan was terrifying
we spent a great deal of time running away from him i seem to remember him and his dragon that is
few things are as frightening as having an enraged dragon chasing you
you seem inordinately interested in him
eragon blinked once
i am curious
he was the last of the forsworn to die and brom was the one who slew him
and now morzan is son is my mortal enemy
let me see then said jeod
he was tall he had broad shoulders his hair was dark like a raven is feathers and his eyes were different colors
one was blue and one was black
his chin was bare and he was missing the tip of one of his fingers i forget which
handsome he was in a cruel haughty manner and when he spoke he was most charismatic
his armor was always polished bright whether mail or a breastplate as if he had no fear of being spotted by his enemies which i suppose he had not
when he laughed it sounded as if he were in pain
what of his companion the woman selena did you meet her as well
jeod laughed
if i had i would not be here today
morzan may have been a fearsome swordsman a formidable magician and a murderous traitor but it was that woman of his who inspired the most terror in people
morzan only used her for missions that were so repugnant difficult or secretive that no one else would agree to undertake them
she was his black hand and her presence always signaled imminent death torture betrayal or some other ** eragon felt sick hearing his mother described thusly
she was utterly ruthless devoid of either pity or compassion
it was said that when she asked morzan to enter his service he tested her by teaching her the word for heal in the ancient language for she was a spellcaster as well as a common fighter and then pitting her against twelve of his finest swordsmen
she healed them of their fear and their hate and all the things that drive a man to kill
and then while they stood grinning at each other like idiot sheep she went up to the men and cut their throats
are you feeling well eragon you are as pale as a corpse
i am fine
what else do you remember
jeod tapped the side of his mug
precious little concerning selena
she was always somewhat of an enigma
no one besides morzan even knew her real name until just a few months before morzan is death
to the public at large she has never been anything other than the black hand the black hand we have now the collection of spies assassins and magicians who carry out galbatorix is low skulduggery is galbatorix is attempt to re create selena is usefulness to morzan
even among the varden only a handful of people were privy to her name and most of them are moldering in graves now
as i recall it was brom who discovered her true identity
before i went to the varden with the information concerning the secret passageway into castle ilirea which the elves built millennia ago and which galbatorix expanded upon to form the black citadel that now dominates uru baen before i went to them brom had spent a rather significant length of time spying on morzan is estate in the hope he might unearth a hitherto unsuspected weakness of morzan is
i believe brom gained admittance to morzan is hall by disguising himself as a member of the serving staff
it was then that he found out what he did about selena
still we never did learn why she was so attached to morzan
perhaps she loved him
in any event she was utterly loyal to him even to the point of death
soon after brom killed morzan word reached the varden that sickness had taken her
it is as if the trained hawk was so fond of her master she could not live without him
she was not entirely loyal thought eragon
she defied morzan when it came to me even though she lost her life as a result
if only she could have rescued murtagh as well
as for jeod is accounts of her misdeeds eragon chose to believe that morzan had perverted her essentially good nature
for the sake of his own sanity eragon could not accept that both his parents had been evil
she loved him he said staring at the murky dregs at the bottom of his mug
