when they stopped for the evening eragon felt no better and his temper had worsened
most of the day had been spent on long detours to avoid detection by soldiers with hunting dogs
he dismounted snowfire and asked saphira how is she
i think no worse than before
she stirred slightly a few times but that was ** crouched low to the ground to let him lift the elf out of the saddle
for a moment her soft form pressed against eragon
then he hurriedly put her down
he and murtagh made a small dinner
it was difficult for them to fight off the urge to sleep
when they had eaten murtagh said we can not keep up this pace we are not gaining any ground on the soldiers
another day or two of this and they will be sure to overtake us
what else can we do snapped eragon
if it were just the two of us and you were willing to leave tornac behind saphira could fly us out of here
but with the elf too impossible
murtagh looked at him carefully
if you want to go your own way i wo not stop you
i can not expect you and saphira to stay and risk imprisonment
do not insult me eragon muttered
the only reason i am free is because of you
i am not going to abandon you to the empire
poor thanks that would **
murtagh bowed his head
your words hearten ** he paused
but they do not solve our problem
what can eragon asked
he gestured at the elf
i wish she could tell us where the elves are perhaps we could seek sanctuary with them
considering how they ve protected themselves i doubt she d reveal their location
even if she did the others of her kind might not welcome us
why would they want to shelter us anyway the last riders they had contact with were galbatorix and the forsworn
i doubt that left them with pleasant memories
and i do not even have the dubious honor of being a rider like you
no they would not want me at all
they would accept us said saphira confidently as she shifted her wings to a more comfortable position
eragon shrugged
even if they would protect us we can not find them and it is impossible to ask the elf until she regains consciousness
we must flee but in which direction north south east or west
murtagh laced his fingers together and pressed his thumbs against his temples
i think the only thing we can do is leave the empire
the few safe places within it are far from here
they would be difficult to reach without being caught or followed
there is nothing for us to the north except the forest du weldenvarden which we might be able to hide in but i do not relish going back past gil ead
only the empire and the sea lie westward
to the south is surda where you might be able to find someone to direct you to the varden
as for going east
he shrugged
to the east the hadarac desert stands between us and whatever lands exist in that direction
the varden are somewhere across it but without directions it might take us years to find them
we would be safe though remarked ** long as we did not encounter any urgals
eragon knitted his brow
a headache threatened to drown his thoughts in hot throbs
it is too dangerous to go to surda
we would have to traverse most of the empire avoiding every town and village
there are too many people between us and surda to get there unnoticed
murtagh raised an eyebrow
so you want to go across the desert
i do not see any other options
besides that way we can leave the empire before the ra zac get here
with their flying steeds they will probably arrive in gil ead in a couple of days so we do not have much time
even if we do reach the desert before they get here said murtagh they could still overtake us
it will be hard to outdistance them at all
eragon rubbed saphira is side her scales rough under his fingers
that is assuming they can follow our trail
to catch us though they will have to leave the soldiers behind which is to our advantage
if it comes to a fight i think the three of us can defeat them
as long as we are not ambushed the way brom and i were
if we reach the other side of the hadarac safely said murtagh slowly where will we go those lands are well outside of the empire
there will be few cities if any
