did you now there is a story i d like to hear
after a minute clovis said no maybe i would not at ** he glanced overboard
why i will be hanged
i do believe we can be on our way
ah and here is my little galina punctual as ever
the burly man sprang onto the gangplank and from there onto the docks where he embraced a dark haired girl of perhaps thirteen and a woman who roran guessed was her mother
clovis ruffled the girl is hair and said now you will be good while i am gone wo not you galina
as he watched clovis bid his family farewell roran thought of the two soldiers dead by the ** might have had families as well
wives and children who loved them and a home they returned to each day
he tasted bile and had to wrench his thoughts back to the pier to avoid being sick
on the barges the men appeared anxious
afraid that they might lose their nerve roran made a show of walking about the deck stretching and doing whatever he could to seem relaxed
at last clovis jumped back onto thered boar and cried cast off me ** it is the briny deep for us
in short order the gangplanks were pulled aboard the mooring ropes untied and the sails raised on the three barges
the air rang with shouted orders and chants of heave ho as the sailors pulled on ropes
behind them galina and her mother remained watching as the barges drew away still and silent hooded and grave
we re lucky stronghammer said clovis clapping him on the shoulder
we ve a bit o wind to push us along today
we may not have to row in order to reach the cove before the tide changes **
when thered boar was in the middle of narda is bay and still ten minutes from the freedom of the open sea that which roran dreaded occurred the sound of bells and trumpets floated across the water from among the stone buildings
i do not rightly know said clovis
he frowned as he stared at the town his hands planted on his hips
it could be a fire but no smoke is in the air
maybe some urgals were discovered in the area
concern grew upon his face
did you perchance spy anyone on the road this morning
roran shook his head not trusting himself to speak
flint drew alongside them and shouted from the deck of theedeline should we turn back sir roran gripped the gunwale so hard that he drove splinters under his nails ready to intercede but afraid to appear too anxious
tearing his gaze from narda clovis bellowed in return no
we d miss the tide then
aye aye ** but i d give a day is pay to find out what caused that clamor
as the houses and buildings shrank behind them roran crouched at the rear port of the barge wrapped his arms around his knees and leaned against the cabins
he looked at the sky struck by its depth clarity and color then into thered boar is roiling green wake where ribbons of seaweed fluttered
the pitch of the barge lulled him like the rock of a ** a beautiful day it is he thought grateful he was there to observe it
after they escaped the cove to his relief roran climbed the ladder to the poop deck behind the cabins where clovis stood with his hand on the tiller guiding their course
the captain said ah there is something exhilarating about the first day of a voyage before you realize how bad the food is an start longing for home
mindful of his need to learn what he could about the barge roran asked clovis the names and functions of various objects on board at which point he was treated to an enthusiastic lecture on the workings of barges ships and the art of sailing in general
two hours later clovis pointed at a narrow peninsula that lay before them
the cove be on the far side of ** roran straightened off the railing and craned his neck eager to confirm that the villagers were safe
as thered boar rounded the rocky spit of land a white beach was revealed at the apex of the cove upon which were assembled the refugees from palancar valley
the crowd cheered and waved as the barges emerged from behind the rocks
beside him clovis uttered a dreadful oath
i knew something were amiss the moment i clapped eyes upon you stronghammer
livestock indeed
** you played me like a fool you did
