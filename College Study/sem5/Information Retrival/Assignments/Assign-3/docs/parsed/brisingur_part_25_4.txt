since they only had one free hand apiece katrina slid roran is ring on for him placing it on the third finger of his right hand and he slid katrina is on for her placing it on the third finger of her left hand
i have another gift for you as well said eragon
turning he whistled and waved
pushing his way through the crowd a groom hurried toward them leading snowfire by the bridle
the groom handed eragon the reins to the stallion then bowed and withdrew
eragon said roran you will need a good steed
this is snowfire
he was brom is to begin with then mine and now i am giving him to you
roran ran his eyes over snowfire
he is a magnificent beast
the finest
will you accept him
eragon summoned back the groom and returned snowfire to his care instructing him that roran was the stallion is new owner
as the man and horse left eragon looked at the people in line who were carrying presents for roran and katrina
laughing he said the two of you may have been poor this morning but you will be rich by this evening
if saphira and i ever have a chance to settle down we will have to come live with you in the giant hall you will build for all of your children
whatever we build it will hardly be large enough for saphira i think said roran
but you will always be welcome with us said katrina
both of you
after congratulating them once more eragon ensconced himself at the end of a table and amused himself by throwing scraps of roast chicken toward saphira and watching her snap them out of the air
he remained there until nasuada had spoken with roran and katrina handing them something small he could not see
then he intercepted nasuada as she was departing the festivities
what is it eragon she asked
i cannot linger
was it you who gave katrina her dress and her dowry
i am grateful you were so kind to my family but i wonder
is not the varden desperate for gold
we are nasuada said but not so desperate as before
since my scheme with the lace and since i triumphed in the trial of the long knives and the wandering tribes swore absolute fealty to me and granted me access to their riches we are less likely to starve to death and more likely to die because we do not have a shield or a ** her lips twitched in a smile
what i gave katrina is insignificant compared with the vast sums this army requires to function
and i do not believe i have squandered my gold
rather i believe i have made a valuable purchase
i have purchased prestige and selfrespect for katrina and by extension i have purchased roran is goodwill
i may be overly optimistic but i suspect his loyalty will prove far more valuable than a hundred shields or a hundred spears
you are always seeking to improve the varden is prospects are not you eragon said
always
as you should ** nasuada started to walk away from him then returned and said sometime before sunset come to my pavilion and we will visit the men who were wounded today
there are many we cannot heal you know
it will do them good to see that we care about their welfare and that we appreciate their sacrifice
eragon nodded
i will be there
throughout roran and katrina said little preferring to sit and gaze at each other oblivious to their surroundings
when the bottom of the orange sun touched the distant horizon however eragon reluctantly excused himself
with saphira by his side he left the sounds of revelry behind and walked to nasuada is pavilion breathing deeply of the cool evening air to clear his head
nasuada was waiting for him in front of her red command tent the nighthawks gathered close around
without saying a word she eragon and saphira made their way across the camp to the tents of the healers where the injured warriors lay
for over an hour nasuada and eragon visited with the men who had lost their limbs or their eyes or had contracted an incurable infection in the course of fighting the empire
some of the warriors had been injured that morning
others as eragon discovered had been wounded on the burning plains and had yet to recover despite all the herbs and spells lavished upon them
before they had set forth among the rows of blanket covered men nasuada had warned eragon not to tire himself further by attempting to heal everyone he met but he could not help muttering a spell here and there to ease pain or to drain an abscess or to reshape a broken bone or to remove an unsightly scar
