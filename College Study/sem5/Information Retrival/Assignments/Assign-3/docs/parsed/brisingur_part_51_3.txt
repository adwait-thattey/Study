a moment passed before eragon realized to whom oromis was referring
sloan is in ellesmera said eragon astonished
he lives alone in a small dwelling by a stream on the western edge of ellesmera
death was close upon him when he staggered out of the forest but we tended the wounds of his flesh and he is healthy now
the elves in the city bring him food and clothes and otherwise see to it he is well cared for
they escort him wherever he wishes to go and sometimes they read to him but for the most part he prefers to sit alone saying nothing to those who approach
twice he has attempted to leave but your spells prevented it
i am surprised he arrived here so quickly eragon said to saphira
the compulsion you placed upon him must have been stronger than you realized
aye
in a quiet voice eragon asked have you seen fit to restore his vision
the weeping man is broken inside glaedr said
he cannot see clearly enough for his eyes to be of any use
should i go and visit him asked eragon unsure of what oromis and glaedr expected
that is for you to decide said oromis
meeting you again might only upset him
however you are responsible for his punishment eragon
it would be wrong for you to forget him
with a brisk motion of his head oromis set his goblet on the table and moved his chair closer to eragon
the day grows old and i would keep you here no longer lest i interfere with your rest but there is one more thing i wish to attend to before you depart your hands may i examine them i would like to see what they say about you ** and oromis held out his own hands toward eragon
extending his arms eragon placed his hands palm downward on top of oromis is shivering at the touch of the elf is thin fingers against the inside of his wrists
the calluses on eragon is knuckles cast long shadows across the backs of his hands as oromis tilted them from side to side
then exerting a slight but firm pressure oromis turned eragon is hands over and inspected his palms and the undersides of his fingers
what do you see asked eragon
oromis twisted eragon is hands around again and gestured at his calluses
you now have the hands of a warrior eragon
take care they do not become the hands of a man who revels in the carnage of war
