but how he exclaimed
before either glaedr or oromis could respond eragon whirled toward saphira and with both his mind and his voice he said you knew you knew and yet you let me believe morzan was my father this whole time even though it
even though i i
his chest heaving eragon stuttered and trailed off unable to speak coherently
unbidden memories of brom flooded through him washing away his other thoughts
he reconsidered the meaning of brom is every word and expression and in that instant a sense of rightness settled over eragon
he still wanted explanations but he did not need them in order to determine the veracity of glaedr is claim for in his bones eragon felt the truth of what glaedr had said
eragon started as oromis touched him on the shoulder
eragon you need to calm yourself said the elf in a soothing tone
remember the techniques i taught you for meditating
control your breathing and concentrate upon letting the tension drain out of your limbs into the ground beneath you
yes like that
now again and breathe deeply
eragon is hands grew still and his heartbeat slowed as he followed oromis is instructions
once his thoughts had cleared he looked at saphira again and in a soft voice said you knew
saphira lifted her head from the ground
oh eragon i wanted to tell you
it pained me to see how murtagh is words tormented you and yet to be unable to help you
i tried to help i tried so many times but like oromis and glaedr i too swore in the ancient language to keep brom is identity a secret from you and i could not break my oath
wh when did he tell you eragon asked so agitated that he continued speaking out loud
the day after the urgals attacked us outside of teirm while you were still unconscious
was that also when he told you how to contact the varden in gil ead
yes
before i knew what brom wished to say he had me swear to never speak of this with you unless you found out on your own
to my regret i agreed
is there anything else he told you demanded eragon his anger rising again
any other secrets i ought to know like that murtagh is not my only sibling or perhaps how to defeat galbatorix
during the two days brom and i spent hunting the urgals brom recounted the details of his life to me so that if he died and if ever you learned of your relation to him his son could know what kind of a man he was and why he had acted as he did
also brom gave me a gift for you
a memory of him speaking to you as your father and not as brom the storyteller
before saphira shares this memory with you however said oromis and eragon realized she had allowed the elf to hear her words it would be best i think if you knew how this came to pass
will you listen to me for a while eragon
eragon hesitated unsure of what he wanted then nodded
lifting his crystal goblet oromis drank of his wine then returned the goblet to the table and said as you know both brom and morzan were my apprentices
brom who was the younger by three years held morzan in such high esteem he allowed morzan to belittle him order him about and otherwise treat him most shamefully
in a raspy voice eragon said it is hard to imagine brom letting anyone order him about
oromis inclined his head in a quick birdlike dip
and yet so it was
brom loved morzan as a brother despite his behavior
it was only once morzan betrayed the riders to galbatorix and the forsworn killed saphira brom is dragon that brom realized the true nature of morzan is character
as strong as brom is affection for morzan had been it was like a candle before an inferno compared with the hatred that replaced it
brom swore to thwart morzan however and wherever he could to undo his accomplishments and reduce his ambitions to bitter regrets
i cautioned brom against a path so full of hate and violence but he was mad with grief from the death of saphira and he would not listen to me
in the decades that followed brom is hatred never weakened nor did he falter in his efforts to depose galbatorix kill the forsworn and above all else to repay morzan the hurts he had suffered
brom was persistence embodied his name a nightmare for the forsworn and a beacon of hope for those who still had the spirit to resist the ** oromis looked toward the white line of the horizon and took another draught of his wine
