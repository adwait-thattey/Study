she regarded him for a long moment then slowly reached out and took the bouquet which she held beneath her nose
her eyes never left his
they are honest flowers she conceded
her gaze flickered down to his feet and back up again
have you been ill
i had heard but i did not think
he pushed himself away from the wall
i should go
** arya hesitated then guided him to the bay window where he sat on the padded bench that curved from the wall
removing two goblets from a cupboard arya crumbled dried nettle leaves into them then filled the goblets with water and saying boil heated the water for tea
she gave a goblet to eragon who held it with both hands so the warmth seeped into him
he glanced out the window to the ground twenty feet below where elves walked among the royal gardens talking and singing and fireflies floated through the dusky air
i wish
said eragon i wish it could always be like this
it is so perfect and quiet
arya stirred her tea
how fares saphira
i have been preparing to return to the varden
after the blood oath celebration
i have tarried here far too long as it is but i have been loath to leave and islanzadi wished me to stay
also
i have never attended a blood oath celebration and it is the most important of our ** she considered him over the rim of her goblet
is there nothing oromis can do for you
eragon forced a weary shrug
he tried everything he knows
they sipped their tea and watched the groups and couples meander along the garden paths
your studies go well though she asked
they ** in the lull that followed eragon picked up the scrap of paper from between the trees and examined her stanzas as if reading them for the first time
do you often write poetry
arya extended her hand for the paper and when he gave it to her rolled it into a tube so that the words were no longer visible
it is custom that everyone who attends the blood oath celebration should bring a poem a song or some other piece of art that they have made and share it with those assembled
i have but begun to work on mine
if you had read much poetry
arya paused then dipped her head and said forgive me
you are not the person i first met in gil ead
no
i
he stopped and twisted the goblet between his hands while he searched for the right words
arya
you will be leaving soon enough
i would count it a shame if this is the last i see of you between now and then
could we not meet occasionally as we did before and you could show saphira and me more of ellesmera
it would not be wise she said in a gentle but firm voice
he looked up at her
must the price of my indiscretion be our friendship i cannot help how i feel toward you but i would rather suffer another wound from durza than allow my foolishness to destroy the companionship that existed between us
i value it too highly
lifting her goblet arya finished the last of her tea before responding
our friendship shall endure eragon
as for us spending time together
her lips curved with a hint of a smile
perhaps
however we shall have to wait and see what the future brings for i am busy and can promise nothing
he knew her words were the closest thing to a conciliation he was likely to receive and he was grateful for them
of course arya svit kona he said and bowed his head
they exchanged a few more pleasantries but it was clear that arya had gone as far as she was willing to go that day so eragon returned to saphira his hope restored by what he had ** it is up to fate to decide the outcome he thought as he settled before oromis is latest scroll
reaching into the pouch at his belt eragon withdrew a soapstone container of nalgask beeswax melted with hazelnut oil and smeared it over his lips to protect them against the cold wind that scoured his face
he closed the pouch then wrapped his arms around saphira is neck and buried his face in the crook of his elbow to reduce the glare from the wimpled clouds beneath them
the tireless beat of saphira is wings dominated his hearing higher and faster than that of glaedr is whom she followed
they flew southwest from dawn until early afternoon often pausing for enthusiastic sparring bouts between saphira and glaedr during which eragon had to strap his arms onto the saddle to prevent himself from being thrown off by the stomach turning acrobatics
