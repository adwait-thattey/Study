better rumbled glaedr ** better
he bent his gaze toward ** and i will have to train together soon
the old dragon snorted and crawled alongside oromis half hopping with his front leg to compensate for his missing limb
darting forward saphira nipped at the end of glaedr is tail tossing it into the air with a flip of her head like she would to break the neck of a deer
she recoiled as glaedr twisted round and snapped at her neck exposing his enormous fangs
eragon winced and too late covered his ears to protect them from glaedr is roar
the speed and intensity of glaedr is response suggested to eragon that this was not the first time saphira had annoyed him throughout the day
instead of remorse eragon detected an excited playfulness in her like a child with a new toy and a near blind devotion to the other dragon
contain yourself ** said oromis
saphira pranced backward and settled on her haunches though nothing in her demeanor expressed contrition
eragon muttered a feeble excuse and oromis waved a hand and said begone both of you
without arguing eragon scrambled onto saphira
he had to urge her to take flight and once she did she insisted on circling over the clearing three times before he got her to angle toward ellesmera
what possessed you to bite him he demanded
he thought he knew but he wanted her to confirm it
it was the truth since they spoke in the ancient language yet he suspected that it was but a piece of a larger ** and at what game she tensed underneath ** forget your duty
by
he searched for the right word
unable to find it he reverted to his native speech by provoking glaedr you distract him oromis and me and hinder what we must accomplish
you ve never been so thoughtless before
do not presume to be my conscience
he laughed then heedless for a moment of where he sat among the clouds rolling to his side until he almost dropped from the peak of her ** rich irony that after the times you ve told me what to do
i amyour conscience saphira as much as you are mine
you ve had good reason to chastise and warn me in the past and now i must do the same for you stop pestering glaedr with your attentions
after a minute of peaceful flying she said two seizures in one day
how are you now
sore and ** ** of it is from the rimgar and sparring but mostly it is the aftereffects of the pain
it is like a poison weakening my muscles and clouding my mind
i just hope that i can remain sane long enough to reach the end of this training
afterward though
i do not know what i will do
i certainly can not fight for the varden like this
do not think about it she ** can do nothing about your condition and you will only make yourself feel worse
live in the present remember the past and fear not the future for it does not exist and never shall
there is only now
he patted her shoulder and smiled with resigned gratitude
to their right a goshawk rode a warm air current while it patrolled the broken forest for signs of furred or feathered quarry
eragon watched it pondering the question that oromis had given him how could he justify fighting the empire when it would cause so much grief and agony
that galbatorix has
she hesitated then said no i wo not tell you
you should figure this out for yourself
i am
if you do not know why what we do is the right thing you might as well surrender to galbatorix for all the good you will ** matter how eloquent his pleas he could extract nothing more from her for she blocked him from that part of her mind
back in their eyrie eragon ate a light supper and was just about to open one of oromis is scrolls when a knock on the screen door disturbed his quiet
enter he said hoping that arya had returned to see him
arya greeted eragon and saphira then said i thought that you might appreciate an opportunity to visit tialdari hall and the adjacent gardens since you expressed interest in them yesterday
that is if you are not too ** she wore a flowing red kirtle trimmed and decorated with intricate designs wrought in black thread
the color scheme echoed the queen is robes and emphasized the strong resemblance between mother and daughter
