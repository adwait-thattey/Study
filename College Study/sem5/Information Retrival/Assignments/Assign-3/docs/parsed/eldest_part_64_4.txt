and the sun began its descent toward evening
as eragon and saphira prepared for their seventh and final assault a trumpet sounded in the east loud and clear and king orrin shouted the dwarves are ** the dwarves are **
dwarves eragon blinked and glanced around confused
he saw nothing but soldiers
then a jolt of excitement raced through him as he ** ** he climbed onto saphira and she jumped into the air hanging for a moment on her tattered wings as they surveyed the battlefield
it was true a great host marched out of the east toward the burning plains
at its head strode king hrothgar clad in gold mail his jeweled helm upon his brow and volund his ancient war hammer gripped in his iron fist
the dwarf king raised volund in greeting when he saw eragon and saphira
eragon howled at the top of his lungs and returned the gesture brandishing zar roc in the air
a surge of renewed vigor made him forget his wounds and feel fierce and determined again
saphira added her voice to his and the varden looked to her with hope while the empire is soldiers hesitated with fear
what did you see cried orik as saphira dropped back to earth
is it hrothgar how many warriors did he bring
ecstatic with relief eragon stood in his stirrups and shouted take heart king hrothgar is ** and it looks like every single dwarf is behind ** we will crush the ** after the men stopped cheering he added now take your swords and remind these flea bitten cowards why they should fear us
**
just as saphira leaped toward the soldiers eragon heard a second cry this one from the west a ** a ship is coming up the jiet **
blast it he ** can not let a ship land if it is bringing reinforcements for the empire
contacting trianna he said tell nasuada that saphira and i will take care of this
we will sink the ship if it is from galbatorix
as you wish argetlam replied the sorceress
without hesitation saphira took flight circling high over the trampled smoking plain
as the relentless clamor of combat faded from his ears eragon took a deep breath feeling his mind clear
below he was surprised by how scattered both armies had become
the empire and the varden had disintegrated into a series of smaller groups contending against one another over the entire breadth and width of the burning plains
it was into this confused tumult that the dwarves inserted themselves catching the empire from the side as orrin had done earlier with his cavalry
eragon lost sight of the battle when saphira turned to her left and soared through the clouds in the direction of the jiet river
a gust of wind blew the peat smoke out of their way and unveiled a large three masted ship riding upon the orange water rowing against the current with two banks of oars
the ship was scarred and damaged and flew no colors to declare its allegiance
nevertheless eragon readied himself to destroy the vessel
as saphira dove toward it he lifted zar roc overhead and loosed his savage war cry
