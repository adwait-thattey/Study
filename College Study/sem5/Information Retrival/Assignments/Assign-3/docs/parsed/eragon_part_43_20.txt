actually i expected the same thing but ajihad lets me have all this as long as i do not cause trouble
and they bring me huge meals as well as anything i want from the library
if i am not careful i will turn into a fat scholar
eragon laughed and with a wondering smile seated himself next to murtagh
but are not you angry you re still a prisoner
oh i was at first said murtagh with a shrug
but the more i thought about it the more i came to realize that this is really the best place for me
even if ajihad gave me my freedom i would stay in my room most of the time anyway
you know well enough
no one would be at ease around me knowing my true identity and there would always be people who would not limit themselves to harsh looks or words
but enough of that i am eager to know what is new
come tell me
eragon recounted the events of the past two days including his encounter with the twins in the library
when he finished murtagh leaned back reflectively
i suspect he said that arya is more important than either of us thought
consider what you ve learned she is a master of the sword powerful in magic and most significantly was chosen to guard saphira is egg
she cannot be ordinary even among the elves
murtagh stared at the ceiling
you know i find this imprisonment oddly peaceful
for once in my life i do not have to be afraid
i know i ought to be
yet something about this place puts me at ease
a good night is sleep helps too
i know what you mean said eragon wryly
he moved to a softer place on the bed
nasuada said that she visited you
did she say anything interesting
murtagh is gaze shifted into the distance and he shook his head
no she only wanted to meet me
does not she look like a princess and the way she carries ** when she first entered through that doorway i thought she was one of the great ladies of galbatorix is court
i ve seen earls and counts who had wives that compared to her were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility
eragon listened to his praise with growing ** may mean nothing he reminded ** re leaping to conclusions
yet the foreboding would not leave him
trying to shake off the feeling he asked how long are you going to remain imprisoned murtagh you can not hide forever
murtagh shrugged carelessly but there was weight behind his words
for now i am content to stay and rest
there is no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself to the twins examination
no doubt i will tire of this eventually but for now
i am content
saphira woke eragon with a sharp rap of her snout bruising him with her hard jaw
** he exclaimed sitting upright
the cave was dark except for a faint glow emanating from the shuttered lantern
outside in the dragonhold isidar mithrim glittered with a thousand different colors illuminated by its girdle of lanterns
an agitated dwarf stood in the entrance to the cave wringing his hands
you must come ** great trouble ajihad summons you
there is no **
the dwarf only shook his head beard wagging
go you ** carkna ** **
eragon belted on zar roc grabbed his bow and arrows then strapped the saddle onto ** much for a good night is sleep she groused crouching low to the floor so he could clamber onto her back
he yawned loudly as saphira launched herself from the cave
orik was waiting for them with a grim expression when they landed at tronjheim is gates
come the others are ** he led them through tronjheim to ajihad is study
on the way eragon plied him with questions but orik would only say i do not know enough myself wait until you hear ajihad
the large study door was opened by a pair of burly guards
ajihad stood behind his desk bleakly inspecting a map
arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well
ajihad looked up
good you re here eragon
meet jormundur my second in command
they acknowledged each other then turned their attention to ajihad
i roused the five of you because we are all in grave danger
about half an hour ago a dwarf ran out of an abandoned tunnel under tronjheim
he was bleeding and nearly incoherent but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what was pursuing him an army of urgals maybe a day is march from here
