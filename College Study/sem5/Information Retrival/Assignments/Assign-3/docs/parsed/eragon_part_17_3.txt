the hides were in his hands
eragon is eyes narrowed in irritation
how had the old man managed to sneak up on him everything had been so quiet he would have sworn that no one was around
give them back he snapped
why so you can run off before garrow is even buried the accusation was sharp
it is none of your ** he barked temper flashing
why did you follow me
i did not grunted brom
i ve been waiting for you here
now where are you going
** eragon lunged for the skins and grabbed them from brom is hands
brom did nothing to stop him
i hope you have enough meat to feed your dragon
eragon froze
what are you talking about
brom crossed his arms
do not fool with me
i know where that mark on your hand the gedwey ignasia theshining palm comes from you have touched a dragon hatchling
i know why you came to me with those questions and i know that once more the riders live
eragon dropped the leather and ** is finally happened
i have to get ** i can not run faster than him with my injured legs but if
** he called
for a few agonizing seconds she did not answer but then yes
we ve been ** i need ** sent her a picture of where he was and she took off immediately
now he just had to stall brom
how did you find out he asked in a hollow voice
brom stared into the distance and moved his lips soundlessly as if he were talking to someone else
then he said there were clues and hints everywhere i had only to pay attention
anyone with the right knowledge could have done the same
tell me how is your dragon
she said eragon is fine
we were not at the farm when the strangers came
ah your legs
you were flying
how did brom figure that out what if the strangers coerced him into doing this maybe they want him to discover where i am going so they can ambush us
and where is saphira he reached out with his mind and found her circling far **
no i will watch for a time
because of the slaughter at doru areaba
brom leaned against a tree with a slight smile
i have talked with her and she has agreed to stay above us until we settle our differences
as you can see you really do not have any choice but to answer my questions
now tell me where are you going
bewildered eragon put a hand to his ** could brom speak to saphira the back of his head throbbed and ideas whirled through his mind but he kept reaching the same conclusion he had to tell the old man something
he said i was going to find a safe place to stay while i heal
the question could not be ignored
the throbbing in his head grew worse
it was impossible to think nothing seemed clear anymore
all he wanted to do was tell someone about the events of the past few months
it tore at him that his secret had caused garrow is death
he gave up and said tremulously i was going to hunt down the strangers and kill them
a mighty task for one so young brom said in a normal tone as if eragon had proposed the most obvious and suitable thing to do
certainly a worthy endeavor and one you are fit to carry out yet it strikes me that help would not be ** he reached behind a bush and pulled out a large pack
his tone became gruff
anyway i am not going to stay behind while some stripling gets to run around with a dragon
is he really offering help or is it a trap eragon was afraid of what his mysterious enemies could ** brom convinced saphira to trust him and they ve talked through the mind ** she is not worried
he decided to put his suspicions aside for the present
i do not need help said eragon then grudgingly added but you can come
then we had best be going said brom
his face blanked for a moment
i think you will find that your dragon will listen to you again
he resisted the urge to question ** you meet us at the farm
yes
so you reached an agreement
i guess ** broke contact and soared away
he glanced at carvahall and saw people running from house to house
i think they re looking for me
brom raised an eyebrow
probably
shall we go
eragon hesitated
i d like to leave a message for roran
it does not seem right to run off without telling him why
it is been taken care of assured brom
i left a letter for him with gertrude explaining a few things
