glancing down the mountain he saw a man approaching in the forest below
roran ducked behind a boulder bow drawn
he waited until he was sure it was albriech then whistled softly
albriech soon arrived at the boulder
on his back was an overfull pack which he dropped to the ground with a grunt
i thought i d never find you
ca not say i enjoyed wandering through the forest after sundown
i kept expecting to walk into a bear or worse
the spine is not a fit place for men if you ask me
roran looked back out at carvahall
so why are they here
to take you into custody
they re willing to wait as long as they have to for you to return from **
roran sat with a hard thump his gut clenched with cold anticipation
did they give a reason did they mention the stone
albriech shook his head
all they would say is that it is the king is business
the whole day they ve been asking questions about you and eragon it is all they re interested ** he hesitated
i d stay but they will notice if i am missing tomorrow
i brought plenty of food and blankets plus some of gertrude is salves in case you injure yourself
you should be fine up here
summoning his energy roran smiled
thanks for the help
anyone would do it said albriech with an embarrassed shrug
he started to leave then tossed over his shoulder by the way the two strangers
they re called the ra zac
the morning after meeting with the council of elders eragon was cleaning and oiling saphira is saddle careful not to overexert himself when orik came to visit
the dwarf waited until eragon finished with a strap then asked are you better today
good we all need our strength
i came partly to see to your health and also because hrothgar wishes to speak with you if you are free
eragon gave the dwarf a wry smile
i am always free for him
he must know that
orik laughed
ah but it is polite to ask ** as eragon put down the saddle saphira uncoiled from her padded corner and greeted orik with a friendly growl
morning to you as well he said with a bow
orik led them through one of tronjheim is four main corridors toward its central chamber and the two mirroring staircases that curved underground to the dwarf king is throne room
before they reached the chamber however he turned down a small flight of stairs
it took eragon a moment to realize that orik had taken a side passageway to avoid seeing the wreckage of isidar mithrim
they came to a stop before the granite doors engraved with a seven pointed crown
seven armored dwarves on each side of the entrance pounded the floor simultaneously with the hafts of their mattocks
with the echoing thud of wood on stone the doors swung inward
eragon nodded to orik then entered the dim room with saphira
they advanced toward the distant throne passing the rigid statues hirna of past dwarf kings
at the foot of the heavy black throne eragon bowed
the dwarf king inclined his silver maned head in return the rubies wrought into his golden helm glowing dully in the light like flecks of hot iron
volund the war hammer lay across his mail sheathed legs
hrothgar spoke shadeslayer welcome to my hall
you have done much since last we met
and so it seems i have been proved wrong about zar roc
morzan is blade will be welcome in tronjheim so long as you bear it
also rumbled the dwarf we wish you to keep the armor you wore in the battle of farthen dur
even now our most skilled smiths are repairing it
the dragon armor is being treated likewise and when it is restored saphira may use it as long as she wishes or until she outgrows it
this is the least we can do to show our gratitude
if it were not for the war with galbatorix there would be feasts and celebrations in your name
but those must wait until a more appropriate time
voicing both his and saphira is sentiment eragon said you are generous beyond all expectations
we will cherish such noble gifts
clearly pleased hrothgar nevertheless scowled bringing his snarled eyebrows together
we cannot linger on pleasantries though
i am besieged by the clans with demands that i do one thing or another about ajihad is successor
when the council of elders proclaimed yesterday that they would support nasuada it created an uproar the likes of which i have not seen since i ascended to the throne
