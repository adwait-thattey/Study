so
dras leona said brom as he sat down and lit his pipe
what do the records show
jeod looked at the parchment
here it is
at the beginning of the year three shipments of seithr oil were sent to dras leona
each shipment was only two weeks apart and the records say they were all transported by the same merchant
the same thing happened last year and the year before that
i doubt any one jeweler or even a group of them has the money for so much oil
what about gil ead asked brom raising an eyebrow
it does not have the same access to the rest of the empire
and jeod tapped the parchment they ve only received the oil twice in recent ** he thought for a moment then said besides i think we forgot something helgrind
brom nodded
ah yes the dark gates
it is been many years since i ve thought of it
you re right that would make dras leona perfect for the ra zac
i guess it is decided then that is where we will go
eragon sat abruptly too drained of emotion to even ask what helgrind ** thought i would be happy to resume the hunt
instead i feel like an abyss has opened up before me
dras ** it is so far away
the parchment crackled as jeod slowly rolled up the map
he handed it to brom and said you will need this i am afraid
your expeditions often take you into obscure ** nodding brom accepted the map
jeod clapped him on the shoulder
it does not feel right that you will leave without me
my heart expects to go along but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities
i know said brom
but you have a life in teirm
it is time for the next generation to take up the standard
you ve done your part be happy
what of you asked jeod
does the road ever end for you
a hollow laugh escaped brom is lips
i see it coming but not for a ** he extinguished his pipe and they left for their rooms exhausted
before he fell asleep eragon contacted saphira to relate the night is adventures
