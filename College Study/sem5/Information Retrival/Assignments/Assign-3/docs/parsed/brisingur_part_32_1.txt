two hundred yards away fifty three soldiers and wagon drivers sat around three separate cookfires eating their dinner as dusk rapidly settled over the land
the men had stopped for the night on the broad grass covered bank next to a nameless river
the wagons full of supplies for galbatorix is troops were parked in a rough half circle around the fires
scores of hobbled oxen grazed behind the camp lowing occasionally to each other
twenty yards or so downstream however a soft earth shelf reared high out of the ground which prevented any attack or escape from that quarter
what were they thinking roran wondered
it was only prudent when in hostile territory to camp in a defensible location which usually meant finding a natural formation to protect your back
even so you had to be careful to choose a resting place you could flee from if ambushed
as it was it would be childishly easy for roran and the other warriors under martland is command to sweep out of the brush where they were hiding and pin the men of the empire in the tip of the v formed by the earthen shelf and the river where they could pick off the soldiers and drivers at their leisure
it puzzled roran that trained soldiers would make such an obvious mistake
maybe they are from a city he thought
or maybe they are merely inexperienced
he frowned
then why would they be entrusted with such a crucial mission
have you detected any traps he asked
he did not have to turn his head to know that carn was close beside him as well as halmar and two other men
save the four swordsmen who had joined martland is company to replace those who had died or been irreparably wounded during their last engagement roran had fought alongside all of the men in their group
while he did not like every single one he trusted them with his life as he knew they trusted him
it was a bond that transcended age or upbringing
after his first battle roran had been surprised by how close he felt to his companions as well as by how warm they were to him in turn
none that i can tell murmured carn
but then
they may have invented new spells you cannot detect yes yes
is there a magician with them though
i can not tell for sure but no i do not think so
roran pushed away a shock of narrow willow leaves to better see the layout of the wagons
i do not like it he grumbled
a magician accompanied the other convoy
why not this one
there are fewer of us than you might imagine
** roran scratched his beard still bothered by the soldiers apparent disregard of common sense
could they be trying to invite an attack they do not seem prepared for one but appearances are hardly everything
what sort of trap could they have prepared for us no one else is within thirty leagues and murtagh and thorn were last spotted flying north from feinster
send the signal he said
but tell martland it bothers me they camped here
either they re idiots or they have some sort of defense invisible to us magic or other trickery of the king
silence then i sent it
martland says he shares your concern but unless you want to run back to nasuada with your tail tucked between your legs we try our luck
roran grunted and turned away from the soldiers
he gestured with his chin and the other men scampered with him on hands and knees to where they had left their horses
whoa steady boy he whispered petting snowfire as the stallion tossed his head
in the dim light snowfire is mane and hide gleamed like silver
not for the first time roran wished his horse were a less visible shade a nice bay or chestnut perhaps
taking his shield from where it hung by his saddle roran fit his left arm through the straps then pulled his hammer from his belt
he dry swallowed a familiar tightness between his shoulders and readjusted his grip on the hammer
when the five men were ready carn raised a finger and his eyelids drifted half closed and his lips twitched as if he were talking with himself
a cricket sounded nearby
carn is eyelids snapped open
remember keep your gaze directed downward until your vision adjusts and even then do not look at the ** then he began to chant in the ancient language incomprehensible words that shivered with power
