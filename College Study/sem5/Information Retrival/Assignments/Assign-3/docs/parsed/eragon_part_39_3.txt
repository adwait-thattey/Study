do not talk with me again unless there is no hope of reaching the varden
if that is the case there is information i must impart to you so the varden will survive
farewell eragon rider of dragons
my life is in your hands
arya withdrew from their contact
the unearthly strains that had echoed across their link were gone
eragon took a shuddering breath and forced his eyes open
murtagh and saphira stood on either side of him watching with concern
are you all right asked murtagh
you ve been kneeling here for almost fifteen minutes
yes and grimacing like a pained gargoyle commented saphira dryly
eragon stood wincing as his cramped knees stretched
i talked with ** murtagh frowned quizzically as if to inquire if he had gone mad
eragon explained the elf that is her name
and what is it that ails her asked saphira impatiently
eragon swiftly told them of his entire discussion
how far away are the varden asked murtagh
i am not exactly sure confessed eragon
from what she showed me i think it is even farther than from here to gil ead
and we re supposed to cover that in three or four days demanded murtagh angrily
it took us fivelong days to get ** what do you want to do kill the horses they re exhausted as it is
but if we do nothing she will ** if it is too much for the horses saphira can fly ahead with arya and me at least we would get to the varden in time
you could catch up with us in a few days
murtagh grunted and crossed his arms
of course
murtagh the pack animal
murtagh the horse leader
i should have remembered that is all i am good for nowadays
oh and let is not forget every soldier in the empire is searching for me now because you could not defend yourself and i had to go andsave you
yes i suppose i will just follow your instructions and bring up the horses in the rear like a good servant
eragon was bewildered by the sudden venom in murtagh is voice
what is wrong with you i am grateful for what you did
there is no reason to be angry with ** i did not ask you to accompany me or to rescue me from gil ead
you chose that
i have not forced you to do anything
oh not openly no
what else could i do but help you with the ra zac and then later at gil ead how could i have left with a clear conscience the problem with you said murtagh poking eragon in the chest is that you re so totally helpless you force everyone to take care of **
the words stung eragon is pride he recognized a grain of truth in them
do not touch me he growled
murtagh laughed a harsh note in his voice
or what you will punch me you could not hit a brick ** he went to shove eragon again but eragon grabbed his arm and struck him in the stomach
murtagh doubled over swearing
then he yelled and launched himself at eragon
they fell in a tangle of arms and legs pounding on each other
eragon kicked at murtagh is right hip missed and grazed the fire
sparks and burning embers scattered through the air
they scrabbled across the ground trying to get leverage
eragon managed to get his feet under murtagh is chest and kicked mightily
murtagh flew upside down over eragon is head landing flat on his back with a solid thump
murtagh is breath whooshed out
he rolled stiffly to his feet then wheeled to face eragon panting heavily
they charged each other once more
saphira is tail slapped between them accompanied by a deafening roar
eragon ignored her and tried to jump over her tail but a taloned paw caught him in midair and flung him back to the ground
he futilely tried to push saphira is muscled leg off his chest and saw that murtagh was likewise pinned
saphira roared again snapping her jaws
she swung her head over eragon and glared at ** of all people should know ** fighting like starving dogs over a scrap of meat
what would brom say
eragon felt his cheeks burn and averted his eyes
he knew what brom would have said
saphira held them on the ground letting them simmer then said to eragon pointedly now if you do not want to spend the night under my foot you will politely ask murtagh what is troubling him
she snaked her head over to murtagh and stared down at him with an impassive blue ** tell him that i wo not stand for insults from either of you
