but he soon grew annoyed at being ignored he had become used to having people listen when he spoke
he grinned ruefully dismayed that he had come to rely on people is attention so much since he had joined the varden and forced himself to relax and enjoy the celebration
before long the scent of food permeated the glade and elves appeared carrying platters piled with delicacies
aside from loaves of warm bread and stacks of small round honeycakes the dishes were made entirely of fruit vegetables and berries
the berries predominated they were in everything from blueberry soup to raspberry sauce to thimbleberry jelly
a bowl of sliced apples dripped with syrup and sprinkled with wild strawberries sat beside a mushroom pie stuffed with spinach thyme and currants
no meat was to be found not even fish or fowl which still puzzled eragon
in carvahall and elsewhere in the empire meat was a symbol of status and luxury
the more gold you had the more often you could afford steak and veal
even the minor nobility ate meat with every meal
to do otherwise would indicate a deficit in their coffers
and yet the elves did not subscribe to this philosophy despite their obvious wealth and the ease with which they could hunt with magic
the elves rushed to the table with an enthusiasm that surprised eragon
soon all were seated islanzadi at the head of the table with blagden the raven dathedr to her left arya and eragon by her right hand orik across from them and then all the rest of the elves including nari and lifaen
no chair was at the far end of the table only a huge carved plate for saphira
as the meal progressed everything dissolved around eragon into a blur of talk and mirth
he was so caught up in the festivities he lost track of time aware of only the laughter and the foreign words swirling over his head and the warm glow left in his stomach by the faelnirv
the elusive harp music sighed and whispered at the edges of his hearing and sent shivers of excitement down his side
occasionally he found himself distracted by the lazy slit eyed stare of the woman child which she kept focused on him with single minded intensity even when eating
during a lull in the conversation eragon turned toward arya who had uttered no more than a dozen words
he said nothing only looked and wondered who she really was
arya stirred
not even ajihad knew
outside of du weldenvarden i told no one of my identity
brom was aware of it he first met me here but he kept it a secret at my request
eragon wondered if she was explaining to him out of a sense of duty or because she felt guilty for deceiving him and saphira
brom once said that what elvesdid not say was often more important that what they did
why though did it matter if anyone knew
this time arya hesitated
when i left ellesmera i had no desire to be reminded of my position
nor did it seem relevant to my task with the varden and dwarves
it had nothing to do with who i became
with who i ** she glanced at the queen
you could have told saphira and me
arya seemed to bridle at the reproach in his voice
i had no reason to suspect that my standing with islanzadi had improved and telling you that would have changed nothing
my thoughts are my own ** he flushed at her implied meaning why shouldshe who was a diplomat a princess an elf and older than both his father and grandfather whoever they were confide in him a sixteen year old human
at least he muttered you made up with your mother
she smiled oddly
did i have a choice
at that moment blagden jumped from islanzadi is shoulder and strutted down the middle of the table bobbing his head left and right in a mocking bow
he stopped before saphira uttered a hoarse cough and then croaked
the elves froze with mortified expressions while they waited for saphira is reaction
after a long silence saphira looked up from her quince pie and released a puff of smoke that enveloped ** little birds too she said projecting her thoughts so that everyone could hear
the elves finally laughed as blagden staggered back cawing indignantly and flapping his wings to clear the air
