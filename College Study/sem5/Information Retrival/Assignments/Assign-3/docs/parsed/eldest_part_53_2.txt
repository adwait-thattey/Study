make her leave
raising his voice jeod said i can not talk now i am in the middle of a meeting
** you do not have any business
you re ** come out and face me you ** are you a man or not that you wo not even look your wife in the eye she paused for a second as if expecting a response then her screeches increased in volume ** you re a gutless rat a filthy yellow bellied sheep biter without the common sense to run a meat stall much less a shipping company
my father would have never lost so much **
roran winced as the insults ** can not restrain jeod if she goes on much longer
be still ** commanded jeod and silence ensued
our fortunes might be about to change for the better if you but have the sense to restrain your tongue and not rail on like a fishmonger is wife
her answer was cold i shall wait upon your pleasure in the dining room dear husband and unless you choose to attend me by the evening meal and explain yourself then i shall leave this accursed house never to ** the sound of her footsteps retreated into the distance
when he was sure that she was gone roran lifted the dagger from jeod is neck and returned the weapon to nolfavrell before reseating himself in the chair pushed against the door
jeod rubbed his neck and then with a wry expression said if we do not reach an understanding you had better kill me it d be easier than explaining to helen that i shouted at her for naught
you have my sympathy longshanks said loring
it is not her fault
not really
she just does not understand why so much misfortune has befallen ** jeod sighed
perhaps it is my fault for not daring to tell her
that i am an agent for the ** jeod paused at their dumbfounded expressions
perhaps i should start from the beginning
roran have you heard rumors in the past few months of the existence of a new rider who opposes galbatorix
mutterings here and there yes but nothing i d give credence to
jeod hesitated
i do not know how else to say this roran
but thereis a new rider in alagaesia and it is your cousin eragon
the stone he found in the spine was actually a dragon egg i helped the varden steal from galbatorix years ago
the dragon hatched for eragon and he named her saphira
that is why the ra zac first came to palancar valley
they returned because eragon has become a formidable enemy of the empire and galbatorix hoped that by capturing you they could bring eragon to bay
roran threw back his head and howled with laughter until tears gathered at the corners of his eyes and his stomach hurt from the convulsions
loring birgit and nolfavrell looked at him with something akin to fear but roran cared not for their opinions
he laughed at the absurdity of jeod is assertion
he laughed at the terrible possibility that jeod had told the truth
taking rasping breaths roran gradually returned to normal despite an occasional outburst of humorless chuckles
he wiped his face on his sleeve and then regarded jeod a hard smile upon his lips
it fits the facts i will give you that
but so do a half dozen other explanations i ve thought of
birgit said if eragon is stone was a dragon egg then where did it come from
ah replied jeod now there is an affair i am well acquainted with
comfortable in his chair roran listened with disbelief as jeod spun a fantastic story of how brom grumpy old ** had once been a rider and had supposedly helped establish the varden how jeod had discovered a secret passageway into uru baen how the varden arranged to filch the last three dragon eggs from galbatorix and how only one egg was saved after brom fought and killed morzan of the forsworn
as if that were not preposterous enough jeod went on to describe an agreement between the varden dwarves and elves that the egg should be ferried between du weldenvarden and the beor mountains which was why the egg and its couriers were near the edge of the great forest when they were ambushed by a shade
skeptical as he was roran attended with redoubled interest when jeod began to talk of eragon finding the egg and raising the dragon saphira in the forest by garrow is farm
