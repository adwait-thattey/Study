when eragon opened his eyes in the morning he thought the sky had fallen
an unbroken plane of blue stretched over his head and slanted to the ground
still half asleep he reached out tentatively and felt a thin membrane under his fingers
it took him a long minute to realize what he was staring at
he bent his neck slightly and glared at the scaly haunch his head rested on
slowly he pushed his legs out from his fetal curl scabs cracking
the pain had subsided some from yesterday but he shrank from the thought of walking
burning hunger reminded him of his missed meals
he summoned the energy to move and pounded weakly on saphira is side
** wake ** he yelled
she stirred and lifted her wing to admit a torrent of sunshine
he squinted as the snow momentarily blinded him
beside him saphira stretched like a cat and yawned flashing rows of white teeth
when eragon is eyes adjusted he examined where they were
imposing and unfamiliar mountains surrounded them casting deep shadows on the clearing
off to one side he saw a trail cut through the snow and into the forest where he could hear the muffled gurgling of a creek
groaning he stood and swayed then stiffly hobbled to a tree
he grabbed one of its branches and threw his weight against it
it held then broke with a loud crack
he ripped off the twigs fit one end of the branch under his arm and planted the other firmly in the ground
with the help of his improvised crutch he limped to the iced over creek
he broke through the hard shell and cupped the clear bitter water
sated he returned to the clearing
as he emerged from the trees he finally recognized the mountains and the lay of the land
this was where amid deafening sound saphira is egg had first appeared
he sagged against a rough trunk
there could be no mistake for now he saw the gray trees that had been stripped of their needles in the ** did saphira know where this was she was still in the egg
my memories must have given her enough information to find it
he shook his head in silent astonishment
saphira was waiting patiently for ** you take me home he asked her
she cocked her ** know you do not want to but you must
both of us carry an obligation to garrow
he has cared for me and through me you
would you ignore that debt what will be said of us in years to come if we do not return that we hid like cowards while my uncle was in danger i can hear it now the story of the rider and his craven ** if there will be a fight let is face it and not shy away
you are a ** even a shade would run from ** yet you crouch in the mountains like a frightened rabbit
eragon meant to anger her and he succeeded
a growl rippled in her throat as her head jabbed within a few inches of his face
she bared her fangs and glared at him smoke trailing from her nostrils
he hoped that he had not gone too far
her thoughts reached him red with ** will meet blood
i will fight
our wyrds our fates bind us but try me not
i will take you because of debt owed but into foolishness we fly
foolishness or not he said into the air there is no choice we must ** he ripped his shirt in half and stuffed a piece into each side of his pants
gingerly he hoisted himself onto saphira and took a tight hold on her ** time he told her fly lower and faster
time is of the essence
do not let go she cautioned then surged into the sky
they rose above the forest and leveled out immediately barely staying above the branches
eragon is stomach lurched he was glad it was empty
faster faster he urged
she said nothing but the beat of her wings increased
he screwed his eyes shut and hunched his shoulders
he had hoped that the extra padding of his shirt would protect him but every movement sent pangs through his legs
soon lines of hot blood trickled down his calves
concern emanated from saphira
she went even faster now her wings straining
the land sped past as if it were being pulled out from under them
eragon imagined that to someone on the ground they were just a blur
by early afternoon palancar valley lay before them
clouds obscured his vision to the south carvahall was to the north
