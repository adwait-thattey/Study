the shade is countenance darkened
then i will force it from ** his sword whistled through the air
the moment eragon caught the blade on his shield a mental probe spiked deep into his thoughts
fighting to protect his consciousness he shoved durza back and attacked with his own mind
eragon battered with all his strength against the iron hard defenses surrounding durza is mind but to no avail
he swung zar roc trying to catch durza off guard
the shade knocked the blow aside effortlessly then stabbed in return with lightning speed
the point of the sword caught eragon in the ribs piercing his mail and driving out his breath
the mail slipped though and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire
the distraction was all durza needed to break into eragon is mind and begin taking control
** cried eragon throwing himself at the shade
his face contorted as he grappled with durza yanking on his sword arm
durza tried to cut eragon is hand but it was protected by the mail backed glove which sent the blade glancing downward
as eragon kicked his leg durza snarled and swept his black shield around knocking him to the floor
eragon tasted blood in his mouth his neck throbbed
ignoring his injuries he rolled over and hurled his shield at durza
despite the shade is superior speed the heavy shield clipped him on the hip
as durza stumbled eragon caught him on the upper arm with zar roc
a line of blood traced down the shade is arm
eragon thrust at the shade with his mind and drove through durza is weakened defenses
a flood of images suddenly engulfed him rushing through his consciousness
durza as a young boy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains
the tribe abandoned them and called his father ** only it was not durza then but carsaib the name his mother crooned while combing his hair
the shade reeled wildly face twisted in pain
eragon tried to control the torrent of memories but the force of them was overwhelming
standing on a hill over the graves of his parents weeping that the men had not killed him as well
then turning and stumbling blindly away into the desert
durza faced eragon
terrible hatred flowed from his maroon eyes
eragon was on one knee almost standing struggling to seal his mind
how the old man looked when he first saw carsaib lying near death on a sand dune
the days it had taken carsaib to recover and the fear he felt upon discovering that his rescuer was a sorcerer
how he had pleaded to be taught the control of spirits
how haeg had finally agreed
called him desert **
eragon was standing now
durza charged
sword raised
shield ignored in his fury
the days spent training under the scorching sun always alert for the lizards they caught for food
how his power slowly grew giving him pride and confidence
the weeks spent nursing his sick master after a failed spell
his joy when haeg recovered
there was not enough time to react
not enough time
the bandits who attacked during the night killing haeg
the rage carsaib had felt and the spirits he had summoned for vengeance
but the spirits were stronger than he expected
they turned on him possessing mind and body
he had screamed
he was i am **
the sword smote heavily across eragon is back cutting through both mail and skin
he screamed as pain blasted through him forcing him to his knees
agony bowed his body in half and obliterated all thought
he swayed barely conscious hot blood running down the small of his back
durza said something he could not hear
in anguish eragon raised his eyes to the heavens tears streaming down his cheeks
everything had failed
the varden and dwarves were destroyed
he was defeated
saphira would give herself up for his sake she had done it before and arya would be recaptured or killed
why had it ended like this what justice could this be all was for nothing
as he looked at isidar mithrim far above his tortured frame a flash of light erupted in his eyes blinding him
a second later the chamber rang with a deafening report
then his eyes cleared and he gaped with disbelief
the star sapphire had shattered
an expanding torus of huge dagger like pieces plummeted toward the distant floor the shimmering shards near the walls
