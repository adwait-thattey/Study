lacking a trail through the underbrush a horse like snowfire would have taken three or four hours to reach the stone of broken eggs
folkvir managed the trip in a bit over an hour
at the base of the basalt monolith which ascended from the forest floor like a mottled green pillar and stood a good hundred feet higher than the trees eragon murmured halt then slid to the ground
he looked at the distant top of the stone of broken eggs
saphira was up there
he walked around the perimeter searching for a means to achieve the pinnacle but in vain for the weathered formation was impregnable
it possessed no fissures crevices or other faults near enough to the ground that he could use to climb its sides
stay here he told folkvir
the horse looked at him with intelligent eyes
graze if you want butstay here okay folkvir nickered and with his velvet muzzle nudged eragon is arm
yes good boy
you ve done well
fixing his gaze on the crest of the monolith eragon gathered his strength then said in the ancient language **
he realized later that if he had not been accustomed to flying with saphira the experience might have proved unsettling enough to cause him to lose control of the spell and plunge to his death
the ground dropped away beneath his feet at a swift clip while the tree trunks narrowed as he floated toward the underside of the canopy and the fading evening sky beyond
branches clung like grasping fingers to his face and shoulders as he pushed through into the open
unlike during one of saphira is dives he retained his sense of weight as if he still stood upon the loam below
rising above the edge of the stone of broken eggs eragon moved himself forward and released his grip on the magic alighting upon a mossy patch
he sagged with exhaustion and waited to see if the exertion would pain his back then sighed with relief when it did not
the top of the monolith was composed of jagged towers divided by deep and wide gullies where naught but a few scattered wildflowers grew
black caves dotted the towers some natural others clawed out of the basalt by talons as thick as eragon is leg
their floors were blanketed with a deep layer of lichen ridden bones remnants of the dragons ancient kills
birds now nested where dragons once had hawks and falcons and eagles who watched him from their perches ready to attack if he should threaten their eggs
eragon picked his way across the forbidding landscape careful not to twist an ankle on the loose flakes of stone or to get too close to the occasional rifts that split the column
if he fell down one it would send him tumbling out into empty space
several times he had to climb over high ridges and twice more he had to lift himself with magic
evidence of the dragons habitation was visible everywhere from deep scratches in the basalt to puddles of melted rock to a number of dull colorless scales caught in nooks along with other detritus
he even stepped upon a sharp object that when he bent to examine it proved to be a fragment of a green dragon egg
on the eastern face of the monolith stood the tallest tower in the center of which like a black pit turned on its side was the largest cave
it was there that eragon finally beheld saphira curled in a hollow against the far wall her back to the opening
tremors ran her length
the walls of the cave bore fresh scorch marks and the piles of brittle bones were scattered about as if from a fight
saphira said eragon speaking out loud since her mind was closed to him
her head whipped up and she stared at him as if he were a stranger her pupils contracting to thin black slits as her eyes adjusted to the light from the setting sun behind him
she snarled once like a feral dog and then twisted away
as she did she lifted her left wing and exposed a long ragged gash along her upper thigh
his heart caught at the sight
eragon knew that she would not let him approach so he did as oromis had with glaedr he knelt among the crushed bones and waited
he waited without word or motion until his legs were numb and his hands were stiff with cold
