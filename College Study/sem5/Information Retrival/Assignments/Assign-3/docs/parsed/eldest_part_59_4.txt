roran watched with horrified fascination the play that unfolded around him
the essential plot element the crux upon which the outcome depended was time
though they were late was thedragon wing with its oars and sails combined fast enough to traverse the eye and could the sloops which had deployed their own oars now narrow the gap between them and thedragon wing enough to ensure their own survival he could not tell
the pounding drum measured out the minutes roran was acutely aware of each moment as it trickled by
he was surprised when an arm reached over the edge of the basket and baldor is face appeared looking up at him
give me a hand wo not you i feel like i am about to fall
bracing himself roran helped baldor into the basket
baldor handed roran a biscuit and a dried apple and said thought you might like some ** with a nod of thanks roran tore into the biscuit and resumed gazing through the spyglass
when baldor asked can you see the eye roran passed him the glass and concentrated on eating
over the next half hour the foam disk increased the speed of its revolutions until it spun like a top
the water around the foam bulged and began to rise while the foam itself sank from view into the bottom of a gigantic pit that continued to deepen and enlarge
the air over the vortex filled with a cyclone of twisting mist and from the ebony throat of the abyss came a tortured howl like the cries of an injured wolf
the speed with which the boar is eye formed amazed roran
you d better go tell uthar he said
baldor climbed out of the nest
tie yourself to the mast or you may get thrown off
roran left his arms free when he secured himself making sure that if needed he could reach his belt knife to cut himself free
anxiety filled him as he surveyed the situation
thedragon wing was but a mile past the median of the eye the sloops were but two miles behind her and the eye itself was quickly building toward its full fury
worse disrupted by the whirlpool the wind sputtered and gasped blowing first from one direction and then the other
the sails billowed for a moment then fell slack then filled again as the confused wind swirled about the ship
perhaps uthar was right thought ** i ve gone too far and pitted myself against an opponent that cannot be overcome by sheer determination
perhaps i am sending the villagers to their deaths
the forces of nature were immune to intimidation
the gaping center of the boar is eye was now almost nine and a half miles in circumference and how many fathoms deep no one could say except for those who had been trapped within it
the sides of the eye slanted inward at a forty five degree angle they were striated with shallow grooves like wet clay being molded on a potter is wheel
the bass howl grew louder until it seemed to roran that the entire world must crumble to pieces from the intensity of the vibrations
a glorious rainbow emerged from the mist over the whirling chasm
the current moved faster than ever driving thedragon wing at a breakneck pace as it whipped around the rim of the whirlpool and making it more and more unlikely that the ship could break free at the eye is southern edge
so prodigious was her velocity thedragon wing tilted far to the starboard suspending roran out over the rushing water
despite thedragon wing is progress the sloops continued to gain on her
the enemy ships sailed abreast less than a mile away their oars moving in perfect accord two fins of water flying from each prow as they plowed the ocean
roran could not help but admire the sight
he tucked the spyglass away in his shirt he had no need of it now
the sloops were close enough for the naked eye while the whirlpool was increasingly obscured by the clouds of white vapor thrown off the lip of the funnel
as it was pulled into the deep the vapor formed a spiral lens over the gulf mimicking the whirlpool is appearance
then thedragon wing tacked port diverging from the current in uthar is bid for the open sea
the keel chattered across the puckered water and the ship is speed dropped in half as thedragon wing fought the deadly embrace of the boar is eye
