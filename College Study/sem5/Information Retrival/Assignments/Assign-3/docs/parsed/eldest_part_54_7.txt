a disturbance at the doors to her quarters interrupted nasuada
she heard her guards swear and raise their voices then a yelp of pain
the sound of metal clashing on metal rang in the hallway
nasuada backed away from the door in alarm drawing her dagger from its sheath
run ** said trianna
the sorceress placed herself in front of nasuada and pushed back her sleeves baring her white arms in preparation to work magic
take the servants entrance
before nasuada could move the doors burst open and a small figure tackled her legs knocking her to the floor
even as nasuada fell a silvery object flashed through the space she had just occupied burying itself in the far wall with a dullthud
then the four guards entered and all was confusion as nasuada felt them drag her assailant off her
when nasuada managed to stand she saw elva hanging in their grip
what is the meaning of this demanded nasuada
the black haired girl smiled then doubled over and retched on the braided rug
afterward she fixed her violet eyes on nasuada and in her terrible knowing voice she said have your magician examine the wall o daughter of ajihad and see if i have not fulfilled my promise to you
nasuada nodded to trianna who glided to the splintered hole in the wall and muttered a spell
she returned holding a metal dart
this was buried in the wood
but where did it come from asked nasuada bewildered
trianna gestured toward the open window overlooking the city of aberon
somewhere out there i guess
nasuada returned her attention to the waiting child
what do you know about this elva
the girl is horrible smile widened
it was an assassin
an assassin trained by galbatorix himself in the dark uses of ** her burning eyes grew half lidded as if she were in a trance
the man hates you
he is coming for you
he would have killed you if i had not stopped ** she lurched forward and retched again spewing half digested food across the floor
nasuada gagged with revulsion
and he is about to suffer great pain
because i will tell you he stays in the hostel on fane street in the last room on the top floor
you had better hurry or he will get away
** she groaned like a wounded beast and clutched her belly
hurry before eragon is spell forces me to stop you from hurting him
you will be sorry **
trianna was already moving as nasuada said tell jormundur what is happened then take your strongest magicians and hunt down this man
capture him if you can
kill him if you can ** after the sorceress left nasuada looked at her men and saw that their legs were bleeding from numerous small cuts
she realized what it must have cost elva to hurt them
go she told them
find a healer who can mend your injuries
the warriors shook their heads and their captain said no ma am
we will stay by your side until we know it is safe again
the men barricaded the windows which worsened the already sweltering heat that plagued borromeo castle then everyone retreated to her inner chambers for further protection
nasuada paced her heart pounding with delayed shock as she contemplated how close she had come to being ** would become of the varden if i died she ** would succeed me dismay gripped her she had made no arrangements for the varden in the event of her own demise an oversight that now seemed a monumental ** wo not allow the varden to be thrown into chaos because i failed to take precautions
she halted
i am in your debt elva
nasuada faltered disconcerted as she often was by the girl is responses then continued i apologize for not ordering my guards to let you pass night or day
i should have anticipated an event like this
you should have agreed elva in a mocking tone
smoothing the front of her dress nasuada resumed pacing as much to escape the sight of elva is stone white dragon marked face as to disperse her own nervous energy
how did you escape your rooms unaccompanied
i told my caretaker greta what she wanted to hear
elva blinked
it made her very happy
she left on an errand this morning
well be as that may you have my gratitude for saving my life
ask me any boon you want and i shall grant it if it is within my power
