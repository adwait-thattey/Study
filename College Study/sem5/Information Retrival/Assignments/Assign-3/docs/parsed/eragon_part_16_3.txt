he could barely swallow a few bites
how do you feel asked horst
the smith waited a moment
i know this is not the best time but we need to know
what happened
eragon said horst leaning forward i was one of the people who went out to your farm
your house did not just fall apart something tore it to pieces
surrounding it were tracks of a gigantic beast i ve never seen nor heard of before
others saw them too
now if there is a shade or a monster roaming around we have to know
you re the only one who can tell us
eragon knew he had to lie
when i left carvahall
he counted up the time four days ago there were
strangers in town asking about a stone like the one i ** he gestured at horst
you talked to me about them and because of that i hurried ** all eyes were upon him
he licked his lips
nothing
nothing happened that night
the next morning i finished my chores and went walking in the forest
before long i heard an explosion and saw smoke above the trees
i rushed back as fast as i could but whoever did it was already gone
i dug through the wreckage and
found garrow
so then you put him on the plank and dragged him back asked albriech
yes said eragon but before i left i looked at the path to the road
there were two pairs of tracks on it both of them men ** he dug in his pocket and pulled out the scrap of black fabric
this was clenched in garrow is hand
i think it matches what those strangers were ** he set it on the table
it does said horst
he looked both thoughtful and angry
and what of your legs how were they injured
i am not sure said eragon shaking his head
i think it happened when i dug garrow out but i do not know
it was not until the blood started dripping down my legs that i noticed it
we should pursue those men stated albriech hotly
they can not get away with ** with a pair of horses we could catch them tomorrow and bring them back here
put that foolishness out of your head said horst
they could probably pick you up like a baby and throw you in a tree
remember what happened to the house we do not want to get in the way of those people
besides they have what they want ** he looked at eragon
they did take the stone did not they
then there is no reason for them to return now that they have ** he gave eragon a piercing look
you did not mention anything about those strange tracks
do you know where they came from
eragon shook his head
i did not see them
baldor abruptly spoke
i do not like this
too much of this rings of wizardry
who are those men are they shades why did they want the stone and how could they have destroyed the house except with dark powers you may be right father the stone might be all they wanted but i think we will see them again
something had been overlooked though eragon was not sure what
then it struck him
with a sinking heart he voiced his suspicion
roran does not know does he how could i have forgotten him
horst shook his head
he and dempton left a little while after you
unless they ran into some difficulty on the road they ve been in therinsford for a couple of days now
we were going to send a message but the weather was too cold yesterday and the day before
baldor and i were about to leave when you woke up offered albriech
horst ran a hand through his beard
go on both of you
i will help you saddle the horses
baldor turned to eragon
i will break it to him gently he promised then followed horst and albriech out of the kitchen
eragon remained at the table his eyes focused on a knot in the wood
every excruciating detail was clear to him the twisting grain an asymmetrical bump three little ridges with a fleck of color
the knot was filled with endless detail the closer he looked the more he saw
he searched for answers in it but if there were any they eluded him
a faint call broke through his pounding thoughts
it sounded like yelling from outside
he ignored ** someone else deal with it
several minutes later he heard it again louder than before
angrily he blocked it ** can not they be quiet garrow is resting
he glanced at elain but she did not seem to be bothered by the noise
** roar was so strong he almost fell out of the chair
