we can not put it out shouted one of the sailors with a panicked expression
chop off whatever is burning an throw it ** roared uthar in reply
unsheathing his belt knife roran set to work excising a dollop of green fire from the boards by his feet
several tense minutes elapsed before the unnatural blazes were removed and it became clear that the conflagrations would not spread to the rest of the ship
once the cry of all ** was sounded uthar relaxed his grip on the steering wheel
if that was the best their magician can do then i d say we have nothing more to fear of him
we re going to get out of the eye are not we asked roran eager to confirm his hope
uthar squared his shoulders and flashed a quick grin both proud and disbelieving
not quite this cycle but we will be close
we wo not make real progress away from that gaping monster until the tide slacks off
go tell bonden to lower the tempo a bit i do not want them fainting at the oars if n i can help it
and so it was
roran took another shift rowing and by the time he returned to the deck the whirlpool was subsiding
the vortex is ghastly howl faded into the usual noise of the wind the water assumed a calm flat quality that betrayed no hint of the habitual violence visited upon that location and the contorted fog that had writhed above the abyss melted under the warm rays of the sun leaving the air as clear as oiled glass
of the boar is eye itself as roran saw when he retrieved the spyglass from among the rowers nothing remained but the selfsame disk of yellow foam rotating upon the water
and in the center of the foam he thought he could discern just barely three broken masts and a black sail floating round and round and round in an endless circle
but it might have been his imagination
leastways that is what he told himself
elain came up beside him one hand resting on her swollen belly
in a small voice she said we were lucky roran more lucky than we had reason to expect
