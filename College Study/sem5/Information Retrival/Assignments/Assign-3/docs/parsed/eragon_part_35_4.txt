the shade wasplaying with him
eragon retreated toward murtagh arms trembling as he parried the shade is blows
each one seemed more powerful than the last
eragon was no longer strong enough to call upon magic for help even if he had wanted to
then with a contemptuous flick of his wrist the shade knocked zar roc out of eragon is hand
the force of the blow sent him to his knees where he stayed panting
the screeching was louder than ever
whatever was happening it was getting closer
the shade stared down at him haughtily
a powerful piece you may be in the game that is being played but i am disappointed that this is your best
if the other riders were this weak they must have controlled the empire only through sheer numbers
eragon looked up and shook his head
he had figured out murtagh is ** now would be a good time
no you forget something
and what might that be asked the shade mockingly
there was a thunderous reverberation as a chunk of the ceiling was torn away to reveal the night sky
the ** roared eragon over the noise and threw himself out of the shade is reach
the shade snarled in rage swinging his sword viciously
he missed and lunged
surprise spread across his face as one of murtagh is arrows sprouted from his shoulder
the shade laughed and snapped the arrow off with two fingers
you will have to do better than that if you want to stop ** the next arrow caught him between the eyes
the shade howled with agony and writhed covering his face
his skin turned gray
mist formed in the air around him obscuring his figure
there was a shattering cry then the cloud vanished
where the shade had been nothing was left but his cape and a pile of clothes
you killed ** exclaimed eragon
he knew of only two heroes of legend who had survived slaying a shade
i am not so sure said murtagh
a man shouted that is it
he failed
go in and get ** soldiers with nets and spears poured into the banquet room from both ends
eragon and murtagh backed up against the wall dragging the elf with them
the men formed a menacing half circle around them
then saphira stuck her head through the hole in the ceiling and roared
she gripped the edge of the opening with her powerful talons and ripped off another large section of the ceiling
three soldiers turned and ran but the rest held their positions
with a resounding report the center beam of the ceiling cracked and rained down heavy shingles
confusion scattered the ranks as they tried to dodge the deadly barrage
eragon and murtagh pressed against the wall to avoid the falling debris
saphira roared again and the soldiers fled some getting crushed on the way
with a final titanic effort saphira tore off the rest of the ceiling before jumping into the banquet hall with her wings folded
her weight splintered a table with a sharp crunch
crying out with relief eragon threw his arms around her
she hummed ** ve missed you little one
same here
there is someone else with us
can you carry three
of course she said kicking shingles and tables out of the way so she could take off
murtagh and eragon pulled the elf out of hiding
saphira hissed in surprise as she saw ** elf
yes and the woman i saw in my dreams said eragon picking up zar roc
he helped murtagh secure the elf into the saddle then they both climbed onto ** heard fighting on the roof
are there men up there
there were but no more
are you ready
saphira leapt out of the banquet hall and onto the fortress is roof where the bodies of watchmen lay scattered
** said murtagh pointing
a row of archers filed out of a tower on the other side of the roofless hall
saphira you have to take off
** warned eragon
she unfurled her wings ran toward the edge of the building and propelled them over it with her powerful legs
the extra weight on her back made her drop alarmingly
as she struggled to gain altitude eragon heard the musical twang of bowstrings being released
arrows whizzed toward them in the dark
saphira roared with pain as she was struck and quickly rolled to the left to avoid the next volley
more arrows perforated the sky but the night protected them from the shafts deadly bite
