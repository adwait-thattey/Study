cruel cruel you ** his meager strength depleted he curled into an even tighter ball panting and whimpering
bending over him eragon placed his mouth close to sloan is ear and whispered i am not without mercy so i give you this hope if you reach ellesmera you will find a home waiting for you
the elves will care for you and allow you to do whatever you want for the rest of your life with one exception once you enter du weldenvarden you cannot leave
sloan listen to me
when i was among the elves i learned that a person is true name often changes as they age
do you understand what that means who you are is not fixed for all of eternity
a man could forge himself anew if he so wanted
eragon left the staff next to sloan and crossed to the other side of the camp and stretched out his full length on the ground
his eyes already closed he mumbled a spell that would rouse him before dawn and then allowed himself to drift into the soothing embrace of his waking rest
eragon smiled as he saw a set of tracks accompanied by the round imprint of the staff leading away from the camp
the trail was confused and meandering and yet its general direction was northward toward the great forest of the elves
i want him to succeed eragon thought with mild surprise
i want him to succeed because it will mean we may all have a chance to redeem ourselves from our mistakes
and if sloan can mend the flaws in his character and come to terms with the evil he wrought he will find his plight is not so bleak as he believes
for eragon had not told sloan that if the butcher demonstrated that he truly regretted his crimes reformed his ways and lived as a better person queen islanzadi would have her spellweavers restore his vision
however it was a reward sloan had to earn without knowing about its existence else he might seek to trick the elves into bestowing it prematurely
eragon stared at the footprints for a long while then lifted his gaze to the horizon and said good luck
tired but also content he turned his back on sloan is trail and began to run across the gray heath
to the southwest he knew there stood the ancient sandstone formations where brom lay encased in his diamond tomb
he longed to divert his path and to go pay his respects but dared not for if galbatorix had discovered the site he would send his agents there to look for eragon
i will return he said
i promise you brom someday i will return
