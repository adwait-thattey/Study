roran had already pulled his hammer from his belt and was halfway out of the chair when he heard his father is name
it was the only thing that kept him from leaping across the room and knocking jeod ** does he know who garrow is beside him loring and birgit jumped to their feet drawing knives from within their sleeves and even nolfavrell readied himself to fight with a dagger in hand
itis roran is not it jeod asked quietly
he showed no alarm at their weapons
because brom brought eragon here and you look like your cousin
when i saw your poster with eragon is i realized that the empire must have tried to capture you and that you had escaped
although jeod is gaze drifted to the other three in all my imaginings i never suspected that you took the rest of carvahall with you
stunned roran dropped back into his chair and placed the hammer across his knees ready for use
eragon was here
again surprise crossed jeod is face
you do not know then
jeod considered him for a long minute
i think the time has come to drop our pretenses roran garrowsson and talk openly and without deception
i can answer many of the questions you must have such as why the empire is pursuing you but in return i need to know the reason you came to teirm
thereal reason
an why should we trust you longshanks demanded loring
you could be working for galbatorix you could
i was brom is friend for over twenty years before he was a storyteller in carvahall said jeod and i did my best to help him and eragon when they were under my roof
but since neither of them are here to vouch for me i place my life in your hands to do with as you wish
i could shout for help but i wo not
nor will i fight you
all i ask is that you tell me your story and hear my own
then you can decide for yourself what course of action is proper
you re in no immediate danger so what harm is there in talking
birgit caught roran is eye with a flick of her chin
he could just be trying to save his hide
maybe replied roran but we have to find out whatever it is he ** hooking an arm underneath his chair he dragged it across the room placed the back of the chair against the door and then sat in it so that no one could burst in and catch them unawares
he jabbed his hammer at jeod
all right
you want to talk then let us talk you and i
it would be best if you go first
if i do and we re not satisfied by your answers afterward we will have to kill you warned roran
jeod folded his arms
so be it
despite himself roran was impressed by the merchant is fortitude jeod appeared unconcerned by his fate if a bit grim about the mouth
so be it roran echoed
roran had relived the events since the ra zac is arrival in carvahall often enough but never before had he described them in detail to another person
as he did it struck him how much had happened to him and the other villagers in such a short time and how easy it had been for the empire to destroy their lives in palancar valley
resuscitating old terrors was painful for roran but he at least had the pleasure of seeing jeod exhibit unfeigned astonishment as he heard about how the villagers had rousted the soldiers and ra zac from their camp the siege of carvahall thereafter sloan is treachery katrina is kidnapping how roran had convinced the villagers to flee and the hardships of their journey to teirm
by the lost ** exclaimed jeod
that is the most extraordinary tale
** to think you ve managed to thwart galbatorix and that right now the entire village of carvahall is hiding outside one of the empire is largest cities and the king does not even know it
he shook his head with admiration
aye that is our position growled loring and it is precarious at best so you d better explain well and good why we shouldrisk letting you live
it places me in as much
jeod stopped as someone rattled the latch behind roran is chair trying to open the door followed by pounding on the oak planks
in the hallway a woman cried ** let me in ** you can not hide in that cave of yours
roran clicked his fingers at nolfavrell and the boy tossed his dagger to roran who slipped around the writing desk and pressed the flat of the blade against jeod is throat
