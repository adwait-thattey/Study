the herbalist is shop had a cheery sign and was easy to find
a short curly haired woman sat by the door
she was holding a frog in one hand and writing with the other
eragon assumed that she was angela the herbalist
on either side of the store was a house
which one do you think is his he asked
brom deliberated then said let is find ** he approached the woman and asked politely could you tell us which house jeod lives in
** she fell silent but her pen scribbled faster than ever
the frog on her hand croaked and looked at them with baleful eyes
brom and eragon waited uncomfortably but she said no more
eragon was about to blurt something out when angela looked up
of course i will tell ** all you have to do is ask
your first question was whether or not icould tell you and the second was if iwould tell you
but you never actually put the question to me
then let me ask properly said brom with a smile
which house is jeod is and why are you holding a frog
now we re getting somewhere she bantered
jeod is on the right
and as for the frog he is actually a toad
i am trying to prove that toads do not exist that there are only frogs
how can toads not exist if you have one on your hand right now interrupted eragon
besides what good will it do proving that there are only frogs
the woman shook her head vigorously dark curls bouncing
no no you do not understand
if i prove toads do not exist then this is a frog and never was a toad
therefore the toad you see now does not exist
and she raised a small finger if i can prove there are only frogs then toads wo not be able to do anything bad like make teeth fall out cause warts and poison or kill people
also witches wo not be able to use any of their evil spells because of course there wo not be any toads around
i see said brom delicately
it sounds interesting and i would like to hear more but we have to meet jeod
of course she said waving her hand and returning to her writing
once they were out of the herbalist is hearing eragon said she is **
it is possible said brom but you never know
she might discover something useful so do not criticize
who knows toads might really be **
and my shoes are made of gold retorted eragon
they stopped before a door with a wrought iron knocker and marble doorstep
brom banged three times
no one answered
eragon felt slightly foolish
maybe this is the wrong house
let is try the other one he said
brom ignored him and knocked again pounding loudly
again no one answered
eragon turned away in exasperation then heard someone run to the door
a young woman with a pale complexion and light blond hair cracked it open
her eyes were puffy it looked like she had been crying but her voice was perfectly steady
yes what do you want
does jeod live here asked brom kindly
the woman dipped her head a little
yes he is my husband
is he expecting you she opened the door no farther
no but we need to talk with him said brom
we have traveled far
it is very important that we see him
her face hardened
he is busy
brom bristled but his voice stayed pleasant
since he is unavailable would you please give him a message her mouth twitched but she consented
tell him that a friend from gil ead is waiting outside
the woman seemed suspicious but said very ** she closed the door abruptly
eragon heard her footsteps recede
that was not very ** he commented
keep your opinions to yourself snapped brom
and do not say anything
let me do the ** he crossed his arms and tapped his fingers
eragon clamped his mouth shut and looked away
the door suddenly flew open and a tall man burst out of the house
his expensive clothes were rumpled his gray hair wispy and he had a mournful face with short eyebrows
a long scar stretched across his scalp to his temple
at the sight of them his eyes grew wide and he sagged against the doorframe speechless
his mouth opened and closed several times like a gasping fish
he asked softly in an incredulous voice brom
brom put a finger to his lips and reached forward clasping the man is arm
it is good to see you ** i am glad that memory has not failed you but do not use that name
