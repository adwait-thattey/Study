now roran bared a collection of irregular blue green spots each the size of a gold coin that marched from his left armpit down to the base of his spine the result of having fallen upon a jumble of rocks and embossed armor
eragon inspected the lesions then chuckled and said pshaw those are ** did you get lost and run into a rosebush i have one that puts those to ** he removed both his boots then stood and dropped his trousers so that his only garb was his shirt and woolen underpants
top that if you can he said and pointed to the inside of his thighs
a riotous combination of colors mottled his skin as if eragon were an exotic fruit that was ripening in uneven patches from crabapple green to putrefied purple
i jumped off saphira when we were fighting murtagh and thorn in the air
that is how i wounded thorn
saphira managed to dive under me and catch me before i hit the ground but i landed on her back a bit harder than i wanted to
roran winced and shivered at the same time
does it go all the way
he trailed off and made a vague gesture upward
i have to admit that is a remarkable bruise
you should be proud it is quite a feat to get injured in the manner you did and in that
particular
place
well said roran you may have the biggest bruise but the ra zac dealt me a wound the likes of which you cannot match since the dragons as i understand removed the scar from your ** while he spoke he divested himself of his shirt and moved farther into the pulsing light of the coals
eragon is eyes widened before he caught himself and concealed his shock behind a more neutral expression
he berated himself for overreacting thinking it can not be that bad but the longer he studied roran the more dismayed he became
a long puckered scar red and glossy wrapped around roran is right shoulder starting at his collarbone and ending just past the middle of his arm
it was obvious that the ra zac had severed part of the muscle and that the two ends had failed to heal back together for an unsightly bulge deformed the skin below the scar where the underlying fibers had recoiled upon themselves
farther up the skin had sunk inward forming a depression half an inch deep
** you should have shown this to me days ago
i had no idea the ra zac hurt you so badly
do you have any difficulty moving your arm
not to the side or back said roran
he demonstrated
but in the front i can only lift my hand about as high as
** grimacing he lowered his arm
even that is a struggle i have to keep my thumb level or else my arm goes dead
the best way i ve found is to swing my arm around from behind and let it land on whatever i am trying to grasp
i skinned my knuckles a few times before i mastered the trick
eragon twisted the staff between his hands
should i he asked saphira
you will have more cause for regret if roran dies because he could not wield his hammer when the occasion demanded
if you draw upon the resources around us you can avoid tiring yourself further
you know i hate doing that
even talking about it sickens me
our lives are more important than an ant is saphira countered
and are you an ant do not be glib eragon it ill becomes you
with a sigh eragon put down the staff and beckoned to roran
here i will heal that for you
a momentary surge of excitement brightened roran is face but then he hesitated and looked troubled
now is that wise
as saphira said better i tend to you while i have the chance lest your injury cost you your life or endanger the rest of ** roran drew near and eragon placed his right hand over the red scar while at the same time expanding his consciousness to encompass the trees and the plants and the animals that populated the gulch save those he feared were too weak to survive his spell
then eragon began to chant in the ancient language
the incantation he recited was long and complex
repairing such a wound went far beyond growing new skin and was a difficult matter at best
in this eragon relied upon the curative formulas that he had studied in ellesmera and had devoted so many weeks to memorizing
the silvery mark on eragon is palm the gedwey ignasia glowed white hot as he released the magic
