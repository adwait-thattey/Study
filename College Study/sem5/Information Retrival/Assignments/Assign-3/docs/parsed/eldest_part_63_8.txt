the moment they attack we will cut their legs out from under them
i thought you agreed with nasuada is accepting the urgals offer
that does not mean i trust them or want to be right alongside them now does it eragon smiled and did not bother to argue it would be impossible to convince orik that the urgals were not rapacious killers when he himself had refused to consider the possibility until sharing an urgal is memories
the night lay heavy around them as they waited for dawn
orik removed a whetstone from his pocket and proceeded to hone the edge of his curved ax
once they arrived the six other dwarves did the same and the rasp of metal on stone filled the air with a grating chorus
the kull sat back to back chanting death songs under their breaths
eragon spent the time casting wards about himself saphira nasuada orik and even arya
he knew that it was dangerous to protect so many but he could not bear it if they were harmed
when he finished he transferred what power he dared into the diamonds embedded within the belt of beloth the wise
eragon watched with interest as angela clad herself in green and black armor and then taking out a carved wood case assembled her staff sword from two separate handles that attached in the middle and two blades of watered steel that threaded into the ends of the resulting pole
she twirled the completed weapon around her head a few times before seeming satisfied that it would hold up to the shock of battle
the dwarves eyed her with disapproval and eragon heard one grumble
blasphemy that any but durgrimst quan should wield the huthvir
after that the only sound was the discordant music of the dwarves honing their blades
it was near dawn when the cries began
eragon and saphira noticed them first because of their heightened senses but the agonized screams were soon loud enough for the others to hear
rising to his feet orik looked out toward the empire where the cacophony originated
what manner of creatures are they torturing to extract such fearsome howls the sound chills the marrow in my bones it does
i told you that you would not have to wait very long said angela
her former cheer had deserted her she looked pale drawn and gray in the face as if she were ill
from his post by saphira eragon asked youdid this
aye
i poisoned their stew their bread their drink anything i could get my hands on
some will die now others will die later as the various toxins take their toll
i slipped the officers nightshade and other such poisons so they will hallucinate in ** she tried to smile but without much success
not a very honorable way to fight i suppose but i d rather do this than be killed
confusion to our enemies and all that
only a coward or a thief uses ** exclaimed orik
what glory is there in defeating a sick opponent the screams intensified even as he spoke
angela gave an unpleasant laugh
glory if you want glory there are thousands more troops i did not poison
i am sure you will have your fill ofglory by the end of today
is this why you needed the equipment in orrin is tent asked eragon
he found her deed repugnant but did not pretend to know whether it was good or evil
it was necessary
angela had poisoned the soldiers for the same reason nasuada had accepted the urgals offer of friendship because it might be their only hope of survival
the soldiers wails increased in number until eragon longed to plug his ears and block out the sound
it made him wince and fidget and it put his teeth on edge
he forced himself to listen though
this was the cost of resisting the empire
it would be wrong to ignore it
so he sat with his hands clenched into fists and his jaw forming painful knots while the burning plains echoed with the disembodied voices of dying men
