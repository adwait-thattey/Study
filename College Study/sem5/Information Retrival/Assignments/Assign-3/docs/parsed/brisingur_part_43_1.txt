nasuada frowned her face shrinking and elongating as a row of ripples ran through the water in the basin
what for she asked
i should think congratulations are in order
you have accomplished everything i sent you to do and more
no i eragon stopped as he realized she could not see the disturbance in the water
the spell was designed so that nasuada is mirror would provide her with an unobstructed view of him and saphira not the objects they were gazing at
i struck the basin with my hand that is all
oh
in that case let me formally congratulate you eragon
by ensuring orik became king
even if it was by getting myself attacked
nasuada smiled
yes even if it was by getting yourself attacked you have preserved our alliance with the dwarves and that might mean the difference between victory and defeat
the question now becomes how long until the rest of the dwarves army will be able to join us
orik has already ordered the warriors to ready themselves for departure said eragon
it will probably take the clans a few days to muster their forces but once they do they will march immediately
it is a good thing too
we can use their assistance as soon as possible
which reminds me when can we expect you to return three days four days
saphira shuffled her wings her breath hot on the back of eragon is neck
eragon glanced at her and then choosing his words with care he said that depends
do you remember what we discussed before i left
nasuada pursed her lips
of course i do eragon
i she looked off to the side of the image and listened as a man addressed her his voice an unintelligible murmur to eragon and saphira
returning her attention to them nasuada said captain edric is company has just returned
they appear to have suffered heavy casualties but our watchmen say that roran survived
i will let you know once i find out
i would not worry too much though
roran has the luck of once again the voice of an unseen person distracted nasuada and she stepped out of view
my apologies said nasuada her visage reappearing in the basin
we are closing in on feinster and we are having to fight off marauding groups of soldiers lady lorana sends from the city to harass us
eragon saphira we need you for this battle
if the people of feinster see only men dwarves and urgals gathered outside their walls they may believe they have a chance of holding the city and they will fight all the harder because of it
they can not hold feinster of course but they have yet to realize that
if they see a dragon and rider leading the charges against them however they will lose the will to fight
nasuada raised her hand cutting him off
there are other reasons for you to return as well
because of my wounds from the trial of the long knives i cannot ride into battle with the varden as i have before
i need you to take my place eragon in order to see that my commands are carried out as i intend and also to prop up the spirits of our warriors
what is more rumors of your absence are already coursing through the camp despite our best efforts to the contrary
if murtagh and thorn attack us directly as a result or if galbatorix sends them to reinforce feinster
well even with the elves by our sides i doubt we could withstand them
i am sorry eragon but i cannot allow you to return to ellesmera right now
it is too dangerous
pressing his hands against the edge of the cold stone table upon which the basin rested eragon said nasuada please
if not now then when
** eragon drew a deep breath tightening his grip on the table
how soon exactly
nasuada frowned at him
you cannot expect me to know that
first we must take feinster and then we must secure the countryside and then
and then you intend to march on belatona or dras leona and then to uru baen said eragon
nasuada attempted to reply but he did not allow her the opportunity
and the closer you get to galbatorix the likelier it will be that murtagh and thorn will attack you or even the king himself and you will be ever more reluctant to let us go
nasuada saphira and i do not have the skill the knowledge nor the strength to kill galbatorix
