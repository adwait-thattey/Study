he remembered sitting in a dell propped against saphira and watching the same elf maid sway before a rapt audience while she sang
away away you shall fly away
away away you shall fly away
** gone you shall be from me
and i will never see you again
** gone you shall be from me
though i wait for you evermore
he remembered endless poems some mournful others joyful most both
he heard arya is poem in full and thought it fine indeed and islanzadi is which was longer but of equal merit
all the elves gathered to listen to those two works
he remembered the wonders the elves had made for the celebration many of which he would have deemed impossible beforehand even with the assistance of magic
puzzles and toys art and weapons and items whose function escaped him
one elf had charmed a glass ball so that every few seconds a different flower bloomed within its heart
another elf had spent decades traveling du weldenvarden and memorizing the sounds of the elements the most beautiful of which he now played from the throats of a hundred white lilies
rhunon contributed a shield that would not break a pair of gloves woven from steel thread that allowed the wearer to handle molten lead and other such items without harm and a delicate sculpture of a wren in flight chiseled from a solid block of metal and painted with such skill that the bird seemed alive
a tiered wood pyramid eight inches high and constructed of fifty eight interlocking pieces was orik is offering much to the elves delight who insisted upon disassembling and reassembling the pyramid as often as he would allow
master longbeard they called him and said clever fingers mean a clever **
he remembered oromis pulling him aside away from the music and asking the elf what is wrong
you need to clear your ** oromis guided him to a fallen log and had him sit
stay here for a few minutes
you will feel better
i am fine
i do not need to rest protested eragon
you are in no position to judge yourself right now
stay here until you can list the spells of changing great and minor and then you may rejoin us
promise me **
he remembered creatures dark and strange drifting in from the depths of the forest
the majority were animals who had been altered by the accumulated spells in du weldenvarden and were now drawn to the agaeti blodhren as a starving man is drawn to food
they seemed to find nourishment in the presence of the elves magic
most dared reveal themselves only as pairs of glowing eyes on the outskirts of the lantern light
one animal that did expose itself was the she wolf in the form of a white robed woman that eragon had encountered before
she lurked behind a dogwood bush dagger teeth bared in an amused grin her yellow eyes darting from point to point
but not all the creatures were animals
some few were elves who had altered their original forms for functionality or in pursuit of a different ideal of beauty
an elf covered in brindled fur leaped over eragon and continued to gambol about as often on all fours as on his feet
his head was narrow and elongated with ears like a cat his arms hung to his knees and his long fingered hands had rough pads on the palm
later two identical elf women presented themselves to saphira
they moved with languid grace and when they touched their hands to their lips in the traditional greeting eragon saw that their fingers were joined by translucent webbing
we have come far they whispered
as they spoke three rows of gills pulsed on each side of their slender necks exposing pink flesh underneath
their skin glistened as if with oil
their lank hair hung past their narrow shoulders
he met an elf armored in imbricated scales like a dragon with a bony crest upon his head a line of spikes that ran down his back and two pallid flames that ever flickered in the pits of his flared nostrils
and he met others who were not so recognizable elves whose outlines wavered as if seen through water elves who when motionless were indistinguishable from trees tall elves with eyes of black even where the whites should have been who possessed an awful beauty that frightened eragon and when they chanced to touch something passed through it like shadows
