of course it would be foolish to go alone
even a powerful magician can die of a simple accident in the far reaches of the wilderness if he has no one to help him
shepherding you through the beor mountains would be a waste of arya is talents and people would notice if one of blodhgarm is elves disappeared without explanation
therefore
have decided that a kull should accompany you as they are the only other creatures capable of matching your pace
a ** exclaimed eragon unable to contain himself any longer
you would send me among the dwarves with a kull by my side i cannot think of any race the dwarves hate more than the urgals
they make bows out of their ** if i walked into farthen dur with an urgal the dwarves would not pay heed to anything i had to say
i am well aware of that said nasuada
which is why you will not go directly to farthen dur
instead you will first stop at bregan hold on mount thardur which is the ancestral home of the ingeitum
there you will find orik and there you can leave the kull while you continue on to farthen dur in orik is company
staring somewhat beyond nasuada eragon said and what if i do not agree with the path you have chosen what if i believe there are other safer ways to accomplish what you desire
what ways would those be pray tell asked nasuada her fingers pausing in midair
i would have to think about it but i am sure they exist
i have thought about it eragon and at great length
having you act as my emissary is our only hope of influencing the succession of the dwarves
i was raised among dwarves remember and i have a better understanding of them than most humans
i still believe it is a mistake he growled
send jormundur instead or one of your other commanders
i wo not go not while
you wo not said nasuada her voice rising
a vassal who disobeys his lord is no better than a warrior who ignores his captain on the field of battle and may be punished similarly
as your liegelord then eragon i order you to run to farthen dur whether you want to or not and to oversee the choosing of the next ruler of the dwarves
furious eragon breathed heavily through his nose gripping and regripping the pommel of his falchion
in a softer although still guarded tone nasuada said what wil
it be eragon will you do as i ask or will you dispossess me and lead the varden yourself those are your only options
shocked he said no i can reason with you
i can convince you otherwise
you cannot because you cannot provide me with an alternative that is as likely to succeed
he met her gaze
i could refuse your order and let you punish me however you deem fit
his suggestion startled her
then she said to see you lashed to a whipping post would do irreparable harm to the varden
and it would destroy my authority for people would know you could defy me whenever you wanted with the only consequence being a handful of stripes that you could heal an instant later for we cannot execute you as we would any other warrior who disobeyed a superior
i would rather abdicate my post and grant you command of the varden than allow such a thing to occur
if you believe you are better suited for the task then take my position take my chair and declare yourself master of this ** but so long as i speak for the varden i have the right to make these decisions
if they be mistakes then that is my responsibility as well
will you listen to no advice eragon asked troubled
will you dictate the course of the varden regardless of what those around you counsel
nasuada is middle fingernail clacked against the polished wood of her chair
i do listen to advice
i listen to a continuous stream of advice every waking hour of my life but sometimes my conclusions do not match those of my underlings
now you must decide whether you will uphold your oath of fealty and abide by my decision even though you may not agree with it or if you will set yourself up as a mirror image of galbatorix
i only want what is best for the varden he said
you leave me no choice but one i dislike
sometimes it is harder to follow than it is to lead
may i have a moment to think
