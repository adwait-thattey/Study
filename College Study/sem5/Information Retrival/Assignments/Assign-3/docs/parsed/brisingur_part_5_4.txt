he snarled in discomfort that he could hear
the smell now with both lethrblaka present resembled the sort of overpowering stench one would get from tossing a half dozen pounds of rancid meat into a barrel of sewage and allowing the mixture to ferment for a week in summer
eragon clamped his mouth shut as his gorge rose and turned his attention elsewhere to keep from retching
a few paces away roran lay crumpled against the side of the cave where he too had landed
even as eragon watched his cousin lifted an arm and pushed himself onto all fours and then to his feet
his eyes were glazed and he tottered as if drunk
behind roran the two ra zac emerged from a nearby tunnel
they wielded long pale blades of an ancient design in their malformed hands
unlike their parents the ra zac were roughly the same size and shape as humans
an ebony exoskeleton encased them from top to bottom although little of it showed for even in helgrind the ra zac wore dark robes and cloaks
they advanced with startling swiftness their movements sharp and jerky like those of an insect
and yet eragon still could not sense them or the lethrblaka
are they an illusion too he wondered
but no that was nonsense the flesh saphira tore at with her talons was real enough
another explanation occurred to him perhaps it was impossible to detect their presence
perhaps the ra zac could conceal themselves from the minds of humans their prey just as spiders conceal themselves from flies
if so then eragon finally understood why the ra zac had been so successful hunting magicians and riders for galbatorix when they themselves could not use magic
** eragon would have indulged in more colorful oaths but it was time for action not cursing their bad luck
brom had claimed the ra zac were no match for him in broad daylight and while that might have been true given that brom had had decades to invent spells to use against the ra zac eragon knew that without the advantage of surprise he saphira and roran would be hard pressed to escape with their lives much less rescue katrina
raising his right hand above his head eragon cried ** and threw a roaring fireball toward the ra zac
they dodged and the fireball splashed against the rock floor guttered for a moment and then winked out of existence
the spell was silly and childish and could cause no conceivable damage if galbatorix had protected the ra zac like the lethrblaka
still eragon found the attack immensely satisfying
it also distracted the ra zac long enough for eragon to dash over to roran and press his back against his cousin is
hold them off for a minute he shouted hoping roran would hear
whether he did or not roran grasped eragon is meaning for he covered himself with his shield and lifted his hammer in preparation to fight
the amount of force contained within each of the lethrblaka is terrible blows had already depleted the wards against physical danger that eragon had placed around saphira
without them the lethrblaka had inflicted several rows of scratches long but shallow along her thighs and had managed to stab her three times with their beaks those wounds were short but deep and caused her a great deal of pain
in return saphira had laid open the ribs of one lethrblaka and had bitten off the last three feet of the other is tail
the lethrblaka is blood to eragon is astonishment was a metallic blue green not unlike the verdigris that forms on aged copper
at the moment the lethrblaka had withdrawn from saphira and were circling her lunging now and then in order to keep her at bay while they waited for her to tire or until they could kill her with a stab from one of their beaks
saphira was better suited than the lethrblaka to open combat by virtue of her scales which were harder and tougher than the lethrblaka is gray hide and her teeth which were far more lethal in close quarters than the lethrblaka is beaks but despite all that she had difficulty fending off both creatures at once especially since the ceiling prevented her from leaping and flying about and otherwise outmaneuvering her foes
