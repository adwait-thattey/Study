the next morning eragon avoided bringing to mind any of the recent events they were too painful for him to consider
instead he focused his energies on figuring out how to find and kill the ra ** will do it with my bow he decided imagining how the cloaked figures would look with arrows sticking out of them
he had difficulty even standing up
his muscles cramped with the slightest movement and one of his fingers was hot and swollen
when they were ready to leave he mounted cadoc and said acidly if this keeps up you re going to batter me to pieces
i would not push you so hard if i did not think you were strong enough
for once i would not mind being thought less of muttered eragon
cadoc pranced nervously as saphira approached
saphira eyed the horse with something close to disgust and said there is nowhere to hide on the plains so i am not going to bother trying to stay out of sight
i will just fly above you from now on
she took off and they began the steep descent
in many places the trail all but disappeared leaving them to find their own way down
at times they had to dismount and lead the horses on foot holding on to trees to keep from falling down the slope
the ground was scattered with loose rocks which made the footing treacherous
the ordeal left them hot and irritable despite the cold
they stopped to rest when they reached the bottom near midday
the anora river veered to their left and flowed northward
a biting wind scoured the land whipping them unmercifully
the soil was parched and dirt flew into their eyes
it unnerved eragon how flat everything was the plains were unbroken by hummocks or mounds
he had lived his entire life surrounded by mountains and hills
without them he felt exposed and vulnerable like a mouse under an eagle is keen eye
the trail split in three once it reached the plains
the first branch turned north toward ceunon one of the greatest northern cities the second one led straight across the plains and the last went south
they examined all three for traces of the ra zac and eventually found their tracks heading directly into the grasslands
it seems they ve gone to yazuac said brom with a perplexed air
due east and four days away if all goes well
it is a small village situated by the ninor ** he gestured at the anora which streamed away from them to the north
our only supply of water is here
we will have to replenish our waterskins before attempting to cross the plains
there is not another pool or stream between here and yazuac
the excitement of the hunt began to rise within eragon
in a few days maybe less than a week he would use his arrows to avenge garrow is ** then
he refused to think about what might happen afterward
they filled the waterskins watered the horses and drank as much as they could from the river
saphira joined them and took several gulps of water
fortified they turned eastward and started across the plains
eragon decided that it would be the wind that drove him crazy first
everything that made him miserable his chapped lips parched tongue and burning eyes stemmed from it
the ceaseless gusting followed them throughout the day
evening only strengthened the wind instead of subduing it
since there was no shelter they were forced to camp in the open
eragon found some scrub brush a short tough plant that thrived on harsh conditions and pulled it up
he made a careful pile and tried to light it but the woody stems only smoked and gave off a pungent smell
frustrated he tossed the tinderbox to brom
i can not make it burn especially with this blasted wind
see if you can get it going otherwise dinner will be cold
brom knelt by the brush and looked at it critically
he rearranged a couple of branches then struck the tinderbox sending a cascade of sparks onto the plants
there was smoke but nothing else
brom scowled and tried again but his luck was no better than eragon is
** he swore angrily striking the flint again
flames suddenly appeared and he stepped back with a pleased expression
there we go
it must have been smoldering inside
they sparred with mock swords while the food cooked
