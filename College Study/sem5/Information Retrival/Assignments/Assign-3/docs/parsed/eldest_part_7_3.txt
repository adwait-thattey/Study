not especially
i will just be working on quimby is wagon
the blasted frame still wo not sit square
roran nodded pleased
good
then i will take the day and go hunting
there are a few deer farther down the valley that do not look too scrawny
their ribs were not showing at least
baldor suddenly brightened
do you want some company
sure
we can leave at dawn
when he finished eating roran scrubbed his face and hands clean then wandered outside to clear his head
stretching leisurely he strolled toward the center of town
halfway there the chatter of excited voices outside the seven sheaves caught his attention
he turned curious and made his way to the tavern where an odd sight met him
sitting on the porch was a middle aged man draped in a patchwork leather coat
beside him was a pack festooned with the steel jaws of the trappers trade
several dozen villagers listened as he gestured expansively and said so when i arrived at therinsford i went to this man neil
good honest man i help in his fields during the spring and summer
roran nodded
trappers spent the winter squirreled away in the mountains returning in the spring to sell their skins to tanners like gedric and then to take up work usually as farmhands
since carvahall was the northernmost village in the spine many trappers passed through it which was one of the reasons carvahall had its own tavern blacksmith and tanner
after a few steins of ale to lubricate my speaking you understand after a alf year with nary a word uttered except perhaps for blaspheming the world and all beyond when losing a bear biter i come to neil the froth still fresh on my beard and start exchanging gossip
as our transaction proceeds i ask him all gregarious like what news of the empire or the king may he rot with gangrene and trench mouth
was anyone born or died or banished that i should know of and then guess what neil leaned forward going all serious bout the mouth and said that word is going around there is from dras leona and gil ead of strange happenings here there and everywhere in alagaesia
the urgals have fair disappeared from civilized lands and good riddance but not one man can tell why or where
alf the trade in the empire has dried up as a result of raids and attacks and from what i heard it is not the work of mere brigands for the attacks are too widespread too calculated
no goods are stolen only burned or soiled
but that is not the end of it oh no not by the tip of your blessed grandmother is whiskers
the trapper shook his head and took a sip from his wineskin before continuing there be mutterings of a shade haunting the northern territories
he is been seen along the edge of du weldenvarden and near gil ead
they say his teeth are filed to points his eyes are as red as wine and his hair is as red as the blood he drinks
worse something seems to have gotten our fine mad monarch is dander up so it has
five days past a juggler from the south stopped in therinsford on his lonesome way to ceunon and he said that troops have been moving and gathering though forwhat was beyond ** he shrugged
as my pap taught me when i was a suckling babe where there is smoke there is fire
perhaps it is the varden
they ve caused old iron bones enough pain in the arse over the years
or perhaps galbatorix finally decided he is had enough of tolerating surda
at least he knows where to find it unlike those rebels
he will crush surda like a bear crushes an ant he will
roran blinked as a babble of questions exploded around the trapper
he was inclined to doubt the report of a shade it sounded too much like a story a drunk woodsman might invent but the rest of it all sounded bad enough to be **
little information reached carvahall about that distant country but roran at least knew that although surda and the empire were ostensibly at peace surdans lived in constant fear that their more powerful neighbor to the north would invade them
for that reason it was said that orrin their king supported the varden
if the trapper was right about galbatorix then it could mean ugly war crouched in the future accompanied by the hardships of increased taxes and forced ** would rather live in an age devoid of momentous events
