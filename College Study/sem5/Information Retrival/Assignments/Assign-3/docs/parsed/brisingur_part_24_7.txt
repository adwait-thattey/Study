the stroke jarred eragon is shoulder
pressing the attack murtagh struck at eragon is wrist and then when eragon dashed aside zar roc thrust underneath eragon is shield and stabbed through the fringe of his mail hauberk and his tunic and the waist of his breeches and into his left hip
the tip of zar roc embedded itself in bone
the pain shocked eragon like a splash of frigid water but it also lent his thoughts a preternatural clarity and sent a burst of uncommon strength coursing through his limbs
as murtagh withdrew zar roc eragon yelled and lunged at murtagh who with a flip of his wrist trapped the falchion beneath zar roc
murtagh bared his teeth in a sinister smile
without pause eragon yanked the falchion free feinted toward murtagh is right knee then whipped the falchion in the opposite direction and sliced murtagh across the cheek
you should have worn a helmet said eragon
they were so close to the ground then only a few hundred feet that saphira had to release thorn and the two dragons separated before eragon and murtagh could exchange any more blows
as saphira and thorn spiraled upward racing each other toward a pearl white cloud gathering over the tents of the varden eragon lifted his hauberk and tunic and examined his hip
a fist sized patch of skin was discolored where zar roc had crushed the mail against his flesh
in the middle of the patch was a thin red line two inches long where zar roc had pierced him
blood oozed from the wound soaking the top of his breeches
being hurt by zar roc a sword that had never failed him in moments of danger and that he still regarded as rightfully his unsettled him
to have his own weapon turned against him was wrong
it was a warping of the world and his every instinct rebelled against it
saphira wobbled as she flew through an eddy of air and eragon winced renewed pain lancing up his side
it was fortunate he concluded that they were not fighting on foot for he did not think his hip would bear his weight
arya he said do you want to heal me or shall i do it myself and let murtagh stop me if he can
we shall attend to it for you arya said
you may be able to catch murtagh by surprise if he believes you are still wounded
i have to give you permission
otherwise my wards will block the spell
the phrase did not leap into eragon is mind at first but eventually he remembered the construction of the safeguard and in the ancient language whispered i agree to let arya daughter of islanzadi cast a spell on me
we shall have to talk about your wards when you are not so distracted
what if you were unconscious how could we minister to you then
it seemed like a good idea after the burning plains
murtagh immobilized us both with magic
i do not want him or anyone else to be able to cast spells on us without our consent
nor should they but there are more elegant solutions than yours
eragon squirmed in the saddle as the elves magic took effect and his hip began to tingle and itch as if covered with flea bites
when the itching ceased he slid a hand under his tunic and was delighted to feel nothing but smooth skin
right he said rolling his shoulders
let us teach them to fear our names
the pearl white cloud looming large before them saphira twisted to the left and then while thorn was struggling to turn plunged into the heart of the cloud
everything went cold and damp and white then saphira shot out of the far side exiting only a few feet above and behind thorn
roaring with triumph saphira dropped upon thorn and seized him by the flanks sinking her claws deep into his thighs and along his spine
she snaked her head forward caught thorn is left wing in her mouth and clamped down with the snick of razor teeth cutting through meat
thorn writhed and screamed a horrible sound eragon had not suspected dragons were capable of producing
i have him said saphira
i can tear off his wing but i would rather not
whatever you are going to do do it before we fall too far
his face pale beneath smeared gore murtagh pointed at eragon with zar roc the sword trembling in the air and a mental ray of immense power invaded eragon is consciousness
