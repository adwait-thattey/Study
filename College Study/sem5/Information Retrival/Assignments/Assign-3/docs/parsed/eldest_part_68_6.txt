if i had
after garrow died i decided to leave in order to track down the ra zac as well as to avoid putting carvahall in any more ** a humorless laugh escaped him
it did not work but if i had remained the soldiers would have come far sooner
and then who knows galbatorix might have even visited palancar valley himself
i may be the reason garrow father died but that was never my intention nor that you and everyone else in carvahall should suffer because of my choices
he gestured helplessly
i did the best i could roran
and the rest of it brom being a rider rescuing arya at gil ead and killing a shade at the dwarves capital all that happened
** as quickly as he could eragon summarized what had taken place since he and saphira set forth with brom including their sojourn to ellesmera and his own transformation during the agaeti blodhren
leaning forward roran rested his elbows on his knees clasped his hands and gazed at the dirt between them
it was impossible for eragon to read his emotions without reaching into his consciousness which he refused to do knowing it would be a terrible mistake to invade roran is privacy
roran was silent for so long eragon began to wonder if he would ever respond
then you have made mistakes but they are no greater than my own
garrow died because you kept saphira secret
many more have died because i refused to give myself up to the empire
we are equally ** he looked up then slowly extended his right hand
brother
he gripped roran is forearm and they pulled each other into a rough embrace wrestling to and fro as they used to do at home
when they separated eragon had to wipe his eyes with the heel of his hand
galbatorix should surrender now that we re together again he joked
who can stand against the two of us he lowered himself back onto the bedding
now you tell me how did the ra zac capture katrina
all happiness vanished from roran is face
he began to speak in a low monotone and eragon listened with growing amazement as he wove an epic of attacks sieges and betrayal of leaving carvahall crossing the spine and razing the docks of teirm of sailing through a monstrous whirlpool
when at last he finished eragon said you are a greater man than i
i could not have done half those things
fight yes but not convince everyone to follow me
i had no choice
when they took katrina roran is voice broke
i could either give up and die or i could try to escape galbatorix is trap no matter the ** he fixed his burning eyes on eragon
i have lied and burned and slaughtered to get here
i no longer have to worry about protecting everyone from carvahall the varden will see to that
now i have only one goal in life to find and rescue katrina if she is not already dead
will you help me eragon
reaching over eragon grabbed his saddlebags from the corner of the tent where the varden had deposited them and removed a wooden bowl and the silver flask of enchanted faelnirv oromis had given him
he took a small sip of the liqueur to revitalize himself and gasped as it raced down his throat making his nerves tingle with cold fire
then he poured faelnirv into the bowl until it formed a shallow pool the width of his hand
** gathering up his burst of new energy eragon said draumr kopa
the liqueur shimmered and turned black
after a few seconds a thin key of light appeared in the center of the bowl revealing katrina
she lay slumped against an invisible wall her hands suspended above her with invisible manacles and her copper hair splayed like a fan across her back
she is ** roran hunched over the bowl grasping at it as if he thought he could dive through the faelnirv and join katrina
his hope and determination melded with a look of such tender affection eragon knew that only death could stop roran from trying to free her
unable to sustain the spell any longer eragon let the image fade away
he leaned against the wall of the tent for support
aye he said wearily she is alive
and chances are she is imprisoned in helgrind in the ra zac is ** eragon grasped roran by the shoulders
the answer to your question brother is yes
