s natches of the shade is memories continued to flash through eragon
a whirlwind of dark events and emotions overwhelmed him making it impossible to think
submerged in the maelstrom he knew neither who nor where he was
he was too weak to cleanse himself of the alien presence that clouded his mind
violent cruel images from the shade is past exploded behind his eyes until his spirit cried out in anguish at the bloody sights
a pile of bodies rose before him
innocents slaughtered by the shade is orders
he saw still more corpses whole villages of them taken from life by the sorcerer is hand or word
there was no escape from the carnage that surrounded him
he wavered like a candle flame unable to withstand the tide of evil
he prayed for someone to lift him out of the nightmare but there was no one to guide him
if only he could remember what he was supposed to be boy or man villain or hero shade or rider all was jumbled together in a meaningless frenzy
he was lost completely and utterly in the roiling mass
suddenly a cluster of his own memories burst through the dismal cloud left by the shade is malevolent mind
all the events since he had found saphira is egg came to him in the cold light of revelation
his accomplishments and failures were displayed equally
he had lost much that was dear to him yet fate had given him rare and great gifts for the first time he was proud of simply who he was
as if in response to his brief self confidence the shade is smothering blackness assaulted him anew
his identity trailed into the void as uncertainty and fear consumed his perceptions
who was he to think he could challenge the powers of alagaesia and live
he fought against the shade is sinister thoughts weakly at first then more strongly
he whispered words of the ancient language and found they gave him enough strength to withstand the shadow blurring his mind
though his defenses faltered dangerously he slowly began to draw his shattered consciousness into a small bright shell around his core
outside his mind he was aware of a pain so great it threatened to blot out his very life but something or someone seemed to keep it at bay
he was still too weak to clear his mind completely but he was lucid enough to examine his experiences since carvahall
where would he go now
and who would show him the way without brom there was no one to guide or teach him
he recoiled at the touch of another consciousness one so vast and powerful it was like a mountain looming over him
this was who was blocking the pain he realized
like arya is mind music ran through this one deep amber gold chords that throbbed with magisterial melancholy
finally he dared ask who
who are you
one who would ** a flicker of an unspoken thought the shade is influence was brushed aside like an unwanted cobweb
freed from the oppressive weight eragon let his mind expand until he touched a barrier beyond which he could not ** have protected you as best i can but you are so far away i can do no more than shield your sanity from the pain
again who are you to do this
there was a low ** am osthato chetowa the mourning sage
and togira ikonoka the cripple who is whole
come to me eragon for i have answers to all you ask
you will not be safe until you find me
but how can i find you if i do not know where you are he asked despairing
trust arya and go with her to ellesmera i will be there
i have waited many seasons so do not delay or it may soon be too late
you are greater than you know eragon
think of what you have done and rejoice for you have rid the land of a great evil
you have wrought a deed no one else could
many are in your debt
the stranger was right what he had accomplished was worthy of honor of recognition
no matter what his trials might be in the future he was no longer just a pawn in the game of power
he had transcended that and was something else something more
he had become what ajihad wanted an authority independent of any king or leader
he sensed approval as he reached that ** are learning said the mourning sage drawing nearer
a vision passed from him to eragon a burst of color blossomed in his mind resolving into a stooped figure dressed in white standing on a sun drenched stone ** is time for you to rest eragon
