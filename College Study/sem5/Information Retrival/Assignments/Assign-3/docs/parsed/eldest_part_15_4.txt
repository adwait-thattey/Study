stopping at a door gannel ushered eragon through to a curved gallery located directly below the cupola
the passageway banded celbedeil providing a view through the open archways of the mountains behind tarnag as well as the terraced city far below
eragon barely glanced at the landscape for the gallery is inner wall was covered with a single continuous painting a gigantic narrative band that began with a depiction of the dwarves creation under helzvog is hand
the figures and objects stood in relief from the surface giving the panorama a feeling of hyperrealism with its saturated glowing colors and minute detail
captivated eragon asked how was this made
each scene is carved out of small plates of marble which are fired with enamel then fitted into a single piece
would not it be easier to use regular paint
it would said gannel but not if we wanted it to endure centuries millennia without change
enamel never fades or loses its brilliancy unlike oil paint
this first section was carved only a decade after the discovery of farthen dur well before elves set foot on alagaesia
the priest took eragon by the arm and guided him along the tableau
each step carried them through uncounted years of history
eragon saw how the dwarves were once nomads on a seemingly endless plain until the land grew so hot and desolate they were forced to migrate south to the beor ** was how the hadarac desert was formed he realized amazed
as they proceeded down the mural heading toward the back of celbedeil eragon witnessed everything from the domestication of feldunost to the carving of isidar mithrim the first meeting between dwarves and elves and the coronation of each new dwarf king
dragons frequently appeared burning and slaughtering
eragon had difficulty restraining comment during those sections
his steps slowed as the painting shifted to the event he had hoped to find the war between elves and dragons
here the dwarves had devoted a vast amount of space to the destruction wreaked upon alagaesia by the two races
eragon shuddered with horror at the sight of elves and dragons killing each other
the battles continued for yards each image more bloody than the last until the darkness lifted and a young elf was shown kneeling on the edge of a cliff holding a white dragon egg
is that
whispered eragon
aye it is eragon the first rider
it is a good likeness too as he agreed to sit for our artisans
drawn forward by his fascination eragon studied the face of his ** always imagined him older
the elf had angled eyes that peered down a hooked nose and narrow chin giving him a fierce appearance
it was an alien face completely different from his own
and yet the set of his shoulders high and tense reminded eragon of how he had felt upon finding saphira is ** re not so different you and i he thought touching the cool ** once my ears match yours we shall truly be brothers through time
i wonder would you approve of my actions he knew they had made at least one identical choice they had both kept the egg
he heard a door open and close and turned to see arya approaching from the far end of the gallery
she scanned the wall with the same blank expression eragon had seen her use when confronting the council of elders
whatever her specific emotions he sensed that she found the situation distasteful
you have been educating eragon in your mythology
gannel smiled flatly
one should always understand the faith of the society that one belongs to
yet comprehension does not imply ** she fingered the pillar of an archway
nor does it mean that those who purvey such beliefs do so for more than
material gain
you would deny the sacrifices my clan makes to bring comfort to our brethren
i deny nothing only ask what good might be accomplished if your wealth were spread among the needy the starving the homeless or even to buy supplies for the varden
instead you ve piled it into a monument to your own wishful thinking
** the dwarf clenched his fists his face mottled
without us the crops would wither in drought
rivers and lakes would flood
our flocks would give birth to one eyed beasts
