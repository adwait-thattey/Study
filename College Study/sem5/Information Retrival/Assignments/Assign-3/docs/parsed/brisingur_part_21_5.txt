do you feel that the varden ought to show you greater consideration asked eragon
for myself no
for helen
jeod hesitated
i want her to be happy
my reward was in escaping from gil ead with my life when brom and i were attacked by morzan his dragon and his men in the satisfaction of knowing that i had helped strike a crippling blow against galbatorix in being able to return to my previous life and yet still help further the varden is cause and in being able to marry helen
those were my rewards and i am more than content with them
any doubts i had vanished the instant i saw saphira fly out of the smoke of the burning plains
i do not know what to do about helen though
but i forget myself
these are not your troubles and i should not lay them upon you
eragon touched a scroll with the tip of his index finger
then tell me why so many papers have you become a copyist
the question amused jeod
hardly although the work is often as tedious
since it was i who discovered the hidden passageway into galbatorix is castle in uru baen and i was able to bring with me some of the rare books from my library in teirm nasuada has set me to searching for similar weaknesses in the other cities of the empire
if i could find mention of a tunnel that led underneath the walls of dras leona for example it might save us a great deal of bloodshed
everywhere i ** jeod brushed back the lock of hair that was hanging over his forehead
histories myths legends poems songs religious tracts the writings of riders magicians wanderers madmen obscure potentates various generals anyone who might have knowledge of a hidden door or a secret mechanism or something of that ilk that we might turn to our advantage
the amount of material i have to sift through is immense for all of the cities have stood for hundreds of years and some antedate the arrival of humans in alagaesia
is it likely you will actually find anything
no not likely
it is never likely that you will succeed in ferreting out the secrets of the past
but i may still prevail given enough time
i have no doubt that what i am searching for exists in each of the cities they are too old not to contain surreptitious ways in and out through their walls
however it is another question entirely whether records of those ways exist and whether we possess those records
people who know about concealed trapdoors and the like usually want to keep the information to ** jeod grasped a handful of the papers next to him on the cot and brought them closer to his face then snorted and tossed the papers away
i am trying to solve riddles invented by people who did not want them to be solved
he and eragon continued talking about other less important matters until helen reappeared carrying three mugs of steaming hot red clover tea
as eragon accepted his mug he noted that her earlier anger seemed to have subsided and he wondered if she had been listening outside to what jeod had said about her
she handed jeod his mug and from somewhere behind eragon procured a tin plate laden with flat biscuits and a small clay pot of honey
then she withdrew a few feet and stood leaning against the center pole blowing on her own mug
as was polite jeod waited until eragon had taken a biscuit from the plate and consumed a bite of it before saying to what do i owe the pleasure of your company eragon unless i am mistaken this is no idle visit
eragon sipped his tea
after the battle of the burning plains i promised i would tell you how brom died
that is why i have come
a gray pallor replaced the color in jeod is cheeks
oh
i do not have to if that is not what you want eragon quickly pointed out
with an effort jeod shook his head
no i do
you merely caught me by surprise
when jeod did not ask helen to leave eragon was uncertain whether he should continue but then he decided that it did not matter if helen or anyone else heard his story
in a slow deliberate voice eragon began to recount the events that had transpired since he and brom had left jeod is house
he described their encounter with the band of urgals their search for the ra zac in dras leona how the ra zac had ambushed them outside the city and how the ra zac had stabbed brom as they fled from murtagh is attack
