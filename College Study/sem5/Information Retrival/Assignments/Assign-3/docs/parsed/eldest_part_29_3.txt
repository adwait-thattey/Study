the elves danced around their party as they walked flitting here and there as the fancy struck them laughing and occasionally leaping up onto a branch to run over their heads
they praised saphira with names like longclaws and daughter of air and fire and strong one
eragon smiled delighted and ** could live here he thought with a sense of peace
tucked away in du weldenvarden as much outdoors as in safe from the rest of the world
yes he liked ellesmera very much indeed more than any of the dwarf cities
he pointed to a dwelling situated within a pine tree and asked arya how is that done
we sing to the forest in the old tongue and give it our strength to grow in the shape that we desire
all our buildings and tools are made in that manner
the path ended at a net of roots that formed steps like bare pools of earth
they climbed to a door embedded within a wall of saplings
eragon is heart quickened as the door swung open seemingly of its own accord and revealed a hall of trees
hundreds of branches melded together to form the honeycombed ceiling
below twelve chairs were arrayed along each wall
in them reposed four and twenty elf lords and ladies
wise and handsome were they with smooth faces unmarked by age and keen eyes that gleamed with excitement
they leaned forward gripping the arms of their chairs and stared at eragon is group with open wonder and hope
unlike the other elves they had swords belted at their waists hilts studded with beryls and garnets and circlets that adorned their brows
and at the head of the assembly stood a white pavilion that sheltered a throne of knotted roots
queen islanzadi sat upon it
she was as beautiful as an autumn sunset proud and imperious with two dark eyebrows slanted like upraised wings lips as bright and red as holly berries and midnight hair bound under a diamond diadem
her tunic was crimson
round her hips hung a girdle of braided gold
and clasped at the hollow of her neck was a velvet cloak that fell to the ground in languid folds
despite her imposing countenance the queen seemed fragile as if she concealed a great pain
by her left hand was a curved rod with a chased crosspiece
a brilliant white raven perched on it shuffling impatiently from foot to foot
he cocked his head and surveyed eragon with uncanny intelligence then gave a long low croak and shrieked ** eragon shivered from the force of that single cracked word
the door closed behind the six of them as they entered the hall and approached the queen
arya knelt on the moss covered ground and bowed first then eragon orik lifaen and nari
even saphira who had never bowed to anyone not even ajihad or hrothgar lowered her head
islanzadi stood and descended from the throne her cloak trailing behind her
she stopped before arya placed trembling hands on her shoulders and said in a rich vibrato ** arya did and the queen scrutinized her face with increasing intensity until it seemed as if she were trying to decipher an obscure text
at last islanzadi cried out and embraced arya saying o my daughter i have wronged **
eragon knelt before the queen of the elves and her councilors in a fantastic room made from the boles of living trees in a near mythic land and the only thing that filled his mind was ** is a ** it was fitting in a way she had always possessed an air of command but he bitterly regretted the fact for it placed another barrier between them when he would have torn them all away
the knowledge filled his mouth with the taste of ashes
he remembered angela is prophecy that he would love one of noble birth
and her warning that she could not see if it would end for good or for ill
he could feel saphira is own surprise then her amusement
she said it appears that we have been traveling in the presence of royalty without knowing it
perhaps it would have placed her in greater danger
the queen withdrew as if she had been stung and then repeated in the ancient language o my daughter i have wronged ** she covered her face
ever since you disappeared i ve barely slept or eaten
i was haunted by your fate and feared that i would never see you again
