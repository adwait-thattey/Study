from what we know of him he wo not fight until uru baen itself is threatened
it does not matter to galbatorix if we destroy half the empire so long as we come to him not the other way around
why should he bother anyway if we do manage to reach him our troops will be battered and depleted making it all the easier for him to destroy us
you still have not answered saphira protested eragon
that is because i can not yet
this will be a long campaign
by its end you might be powerful enough to defeat galbatorix or the elves may have joined us
and their spellcasters are the strongest in alagaesia
no matter what happens we cannot afford to delay
now is the time to gamble and dare what no one thinks we can accomplish
the varden have lived in the shadows for too long we must either challenge galbatorix or submit and pass away
the scope of what nasuada was suggesting disturbed eragon
so many risks and unknown dangers were involved it was almost absurd to consider such a venture
however it was not his place to make the decision and he accepted that
nor would he dispute it ** have to trust in her judgment now
but what of you nasuada will you be safe while we re gone i must think of my vow
it is become my responsibility to ensure that you wo not have your own funeral soon
her jaw tightened as she gestured at the door and the warriors beyond
you need not fear i am well ** she looked down
i will admit
one reason for going to surda is that orrin knows me of old and will offer his protection
i cannot tarry here with you and arya gone and the council of elders still with power
they wo not accept me as their leader until i prove beyond doubt that the varden are undermy control not theirs
then she seemed to draw on some inner strength squaring her shoulders and lifting her chin so she was distant and aloof
go now eragon
ready your horse gather supplies and be at the north gate by dawn
he bowed low respecting her return to formality then left with saphira
after dinner eragon and saphira flew together
they sailed high above tronjheim where crenulated icicles hung from the sides of farthen dur forming a great white band around them
though it was still hours until night it was already nearly dark within the mountain
eragon threw back his head savoring the air on his face
he missed the wind wind that would rush through the grass and stir the clouds until everything was tousled and fresh
wind that would bring rain and storms and lash the trees so they ** that matter i miss trees as well he ** dur is an incredible place but it is as empty of plants and animals as ajihad is tomb
saphira ** dwarves seem to think that gems take the place of flowers
she was silent as the light continued to fade
when it was too dark for eragon to see comfortably she said it is late
we should return
she drifted toward the ground in great lazy spirals drawing nearer to tronjheim which glowed like a beacon in the center of farthen dur
they were still far from the city mountain when she swung her head saying look
he followed her gaze but all he could see was the gray featureless plain below **
instead of answering she tilted her wings and glided to their left slipping down to one of the four roads that radiated from tronjheim along the cardinal compass points
as they landed he noticed a patch of white on a small hill nearby
the patch wavered strangely in the dusk like a floating candle then resolved into angela who was wearing a pale wool tunic
the witch carried a wicker basket nearly four feet across and filled with a wild assortment of mushrooms most of which eragon did not recognize
as she approached he gestured at them and said you ve been gathering toadstools
hello laughed angela putting her load down
oh no toadstool is far too general a term
and anyway they really ought to be called frogstools not ** she spread them with her hand
thisone is sulphur tuft andthis is an inkcap and here is navelcap and dwarf shield russet tough shank blood ring andthat is a spotted deceiver
delightful is not ** she pointed to each in turn ending on a mushroom with pink lavender and yellow splashed in rivulets across its cap
