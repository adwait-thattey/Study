icreatederagon but its success is the result of the enthusiastic efforts of friends family fans librarians teachers students school administrators distributors booksellers and many more
i wish i could mention by name all the people who have helped but the list is very very long
you know who you are and i thank you
eragonwas first published in early ** by my parents publishing company paolini international llc
they had already released three books so it was only natural to do the same witheragon
we kneweragon would appeal to a wide range of readers our challenge was to spread the word about it
during ** and the beginning of ** i traveled throughout the united states doing over ** book signings and presentations in schools bookstores and libraries
my mother and i arranged all the events
at first i had only one or two appearances per month but as we became more efficient at scheduling our homemade book tour expanded to the point where i was on the road almost continuously
i met thousands of wonderful people many of whom became loyal fans and friends
one of those fans is michelle frey now my editor at knopf books for young readers who approached me with an offer to acquireeragon
needless to say i was delighted that knopf was interested in my book
thus there are two groups of people who deserve thanks
the first assisted with the production of the paolini international llc edition oferagon while the second is responsible for the knopf edition
here are the brave souls who helped bringeragon into existence
the original gang my mother for her thoughtful red pen and wonderful help with commas colons semicolons and other assorted beasties my father for his smashing editing job all the time he spent hammering my vague wayward thoughts into line formatting the book and designing the cover and listening to so many presentations grandma shirley for helping me create a satisfactory beginning and ending my sister for her plot advice her good humor at being portrayed as an herbalist ineragon and her long hours photoshopping saphira is eye on the cover kathy tyers for giving me the means to do a brutal and much needed rewrite of the first three chapters john taliaferro for his advice and wonderful review a fan named tornado eugene walker who caught a number of copyediting errors and donna overall for her love of the story editing and formatting advice and keen eye for all things concerning ellipses em dashes widows orphans kerning and run on sentences
if there is a real life dragon rider she is one selflessly coming to the rescue of writers lost in the swamp of commas
and i thank my family for supporting me wholeheartedly
and for reading this saga more times than any sane person should have to
the new gang michelle frey who not only loved the story enough to take a chance on an epic fantasy written by a teenager but also managed to streamlineeragon is pacing through her insightful editing my agent simon lipskar who helped find the best home foreragon chip gibson and beverly horowitz for the wonderful offer lawrence levy for his good humor and legal advice judith haut publicity whiz of the first degree daisy kline for the awe inspiring marketing campaign isabel warren lynch who designed the lovely book jacket interior and map john jude palencar who painted the jacket art ** actually named palancar valley for him long before he ever worked oneragon ** artie bennett the doyen of copyediting and the only man alive who understood the difference betweento scry it andto scry on it and the entire team at knopf who have made this adventure possible
lastly a very special thanks to my characters who bravely face the dangers i force them to confront and without whom i would not have a story
