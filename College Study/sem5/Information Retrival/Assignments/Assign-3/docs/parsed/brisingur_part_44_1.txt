he could feel nasuada studying him but he refused to meet her gaze
during the long dull silence that enveloped them he contemplated a host of dire possibilities and his temples throbbed with a feverish intensity
he wished he could leave the stifling pavilion and breathe the cool air outside
at last nasuada said what am i going to do with you roran
he straightened his spine even more
whatever you wish my lady
an admirable answer stronghammer but in no way does it resolve my ** nasuada sipped wine from a goblet
twice you defied a direct order from captain edric and yet if you had not neither he nor you nor the rest of your band might have survived to tell the tale
however your success does not negate the reality of your disobedience
by your own account you knowingly committed insubordination and i must punish you if i am to maintain discipline among the varden
her brow darkened
blast it stronghammer
if you were anyone else but eragon is cousin and if your gambit had been even one whit less effective i would have you strung up and hanged for your misconduct
roran swallowed as he imagined a noose tightening around his neck
with the middle finger of her right hand nasuada tapped the arm of her high backed chair with increasing speed until stopping she said do you wish to continue fighting with the varden roran
yes my lady he replied without hesitation
what are you willing to endure in order to remain within my army
roran did not allow himself to dwell upon the implications of her question
whatever i must my lady
the tension in her face eased and nasuada nodded appearing satisfied
i hoped you would say that
tradition and established precedent leave me only three choices
one i can hang you but i wo not
for a multitude of reasons
two i can give you thirty lashes and then discharge you from the ranks of the varden
or three i can give you fifty lashes and keep you under my command
fifty lashes is not that many more than thirty roran thought trying to bolster his courage
he wet his lips
would i be flogged where all could see
nasuada is eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch
your pride has no part in this stronghammer
the punishment must be severe so that others are not tempted to follow in your footsteps and it must be held in public so that the whole of the varden can profit by it
if you are even half as intelligent as you seem you knew when you defied edric that your decision would have consequences and that those consequences would most likely be unpleasant
the choice you must now make is simple will you stay with the varden or will you abandon your friends and family and go your own way
roran lifted his chin angry that she would question his word
i shall not leave lady nasuada
no matter how many lashes you assign me they cannot be as painful as losing my home and my father was
no said nasuada softly
they could not
one of the magicians of du vrangr gata will oversee the flogging and attend to you afterward to ensure that the whip causes you no permanent damage
however they shall not entirely heal your wounds nor may you seek out a magician on your own to mend your back
your flogging will be held as soon as jormundur can marshal the troops
until then you will remain under guard in a tent by the whipping post
it relieved roran that he would not have to wait any longer he did not want to have to labor for days under the shadow of what lay before him
my lady he said and she dismissed him with a motion of her finger
turning on his heel roran marched out of the pavilion
two guards took up positions on either side of him as he emerged
without looking at or speaking to him they led roran through the camp until they arrived at a small empty tent not far from the blackened whipping post which stood upon a slight rise just beyond the edge of the camp
the post was six and a half feet high and had a thick crossbeam near the top to which prisoners wrists were tied
rows of scratches from the fingernails of scourged men covered the crossbeam
roran forced himself to look away and then ducked inside the tent
