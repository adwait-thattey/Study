** cried arya and started to run toward the city gates
eragon and blodhgarm raced after her while saphira followed close behind her claws loud against the paving stones of the street
archers fired arrows at them from the parapet above and three different times soldiers rushed out from the main bulk of the city and flung themselves against them
without slowing eragon arya and blodhgarm cut down the attackers or else saphira blasted them with a withering torrent of fire
the steady boom of the battering ram became ever louder as they approached the forty foot tall gates of the city
eragon saw two men and a woman who were garbed in dark robes standing before the iron bound doors chanting in the ancient language and swaying from side to side with upheld arms
the three spellcasters fell silent when they noticed eragon and his companions and with their robes flapping ran up the main street of feinster which led to the keep at the far side of the city
eragon longed to pursue them
however it was more important to let the varden into the city where they would no longer be at the mercy of the men on the walls
i wonder what mischief they have planned he thought worried as he watched the spellcasters depart
before eragon arya blodhgarm and saphira arrived at the gates fifty soldiers in gleaming armor streamed out of the guard towers and positioned themselves in front of the huge wooden doors
one of the soldiers pounded the hilt of his sword against his shield and shouted never shall you pass foul ** this is our home and we shall not allow urgals and elves and other inhuman monsters to ** begone for you shall find nothing but blood and sorrow in **
arya pointed at the guard towers and murmured to eragon the gears for opening the gates are hidden within there
go he said
you and blodhgarm sneak around the men and slip into the towers
saphira and i will keep them occupied in the meantime
arya nodded then she and blodhgarm disappeared into the pools of inky shadows that surrounded the houses behind eragon and saphira
through his bond with her eragon sensed that saphira was gathering herself to pounce upon the group of soldiers
he put a hand on one of her forelegs
wait he said
let me try something first
if it does not work then may i tear them to shreds she asked licking her fangs
yes then you may do what you wish with them
eragon slowly walked toward the soldiers holding his sword and shield out to either side
an arrow shot toward him from above only to stop dead in the air three feet from his chest and drop straight to the ground
eragon looked over the soldiers frightened faces then raised his voice and said my name is eragon ** perhaps you have heard of me and perhaps not
in either case know this i am a dragon rider and i have sworn to help the varden remove galbatorix from his throne
tell me have any of you sworn fealty in the ancient language to galbatorix or the empire
well have you
the same man who had spoken before who appeared to be the captain of the soldiers said we would not swear fealty to the king even if he held a sword to our ** our loyalty belongs to lady lorana
she and her family have ruled us for four generations and they ve done a fine job of it ** the other soldiers muttered in agreement
then join ** cried eragon
lay down your weapons and i promise no harm shall come to you or your families
you cannot hope to hold feinster against the combined might of the varden surda the dwarves and the elves
so you say shouted one of the soldiers
but what if murtagh and that red dragon of his should come here again
eragon hesitated then said in a confident tone he is no match for me and the elves who fight with the varden
we have already driven him off once ** to the left of the soldiers eragon saw arya and blodhgarm sidle out from behind one of the stone staircases that led to the top of the walls and with silent footsteps creep toward the leftmost guard tower
the captain of the soldiers said we may not have pledged ourselves to the king but lady lorana has
what will you do to her then kill her imprison her no we will not betray our trust and allow you to pass nor the monsters clawing at our walls
