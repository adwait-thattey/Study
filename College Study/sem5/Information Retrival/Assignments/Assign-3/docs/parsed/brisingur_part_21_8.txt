in the beginning she loved him maybe not so much later
murtagh is her son
jeod raised an eyebrow
indeed you have it from murtagh himself i suppose eragon nodded
well that explains a number of questions i always had
murtagh is mother
i am surprised that brom did not uncover that particular secret
morzan did everything he could to conceal murtagh is existence even from the other members of the forsworn
knowing the history of those power hungry backstabbing knaves he probably saved murtagh is life
more is the pity too
silence crept among them then like a shy animal ready to flee at the slightest motion
eragon continued to gaze into his mug
a host of questions bedeviled him but he knew that jeod could not answer them and it was unlikely anyone else could either why had brom hidden himself in carvahall to keep watch over eragon the son of his most hated foe had it been some cruel joke giving eragon zar roc his father is blade and why had brom not told him the truth about his parentage he tightened his grip on the mug and without meaning to shattered the clay
the three of them started at the unexpected noise
here let me help you with that said helen bustling forward and dabbing at his tunic with a rag
embarrassed eragon apologized several times to which both jeod and helen responded by assuring him it was a small mishap and not to worry himself about it
while helen picked up the shards of fire hardened clay jeod began to dig through the layers of books scrolls and loose papers that covered the bed saying ah it had nearly slipped my mind
i have something for you eragon that might prove useful
if only i can find it here
with a pleased exclamation he straightened flourishing a book which he handed to eragon
it was domia abr wyrda the dominance of fate a complete history of alagaesia written by heslant the monk
eragon had first seen it in jeod is library in teirm
he had not expected that he would ever get a chance to examine it again
savoring the feeling he ran his hands over the carved leather on the front cover which was shiny with age then opened the book and admired the neat rows of runes within lettered in glossy red ink
awed by the size of the knowledge hoard he held eragon said you wish me to have this
i do asserted jeod
he moved out of the way as helen retrieved a fragment of the mug from under the bed
i think you might profit by it
you are engaged in historic events eragon and the roots of the difficulties you face lie in happenings from decades centuries and millennia ago
if i were you i would study at every opportunity the lessons history has to teach us for they may help you with the problems of today
in my own life reading the record of the past has often provided me with the courage and the insight to choose the correct path
eragon longed to accept the gift but still he hesitated
brom said that domia abr wyrda was the most valuable thing in your house
and rare as well
besides what of your work do not you need this for your research
domia abr wyrda is valuable and it is rare said jeod but only in the empire where galbatorix burns every copy he finds and hangs their unfortunate owners
here in the camp i have already had six copies foisted upon me by members of king orrin is court and this is hardly what one would call a great center of learning
however i do not part with it lightly and only because you can put it to better use than i can
books should go where they will be most appreciated and not sit unread gathering dust on a forgotten shelf do not you agree
i ** eragon closed domia abr wyrda and again traced the intricate patterns on the front with his fingers fascinated by the swirling designs that had been chiseled into the leather
thank you
i shall treasure it for as long as it is mine to watch ** jeod dipped his head and leaned back against the wall of the tent appearing satisfied
turning the book on its edge eragon examined the lettering on the spine
what was heslant a monk of
a small secretive sect called the arcaena that originated in the area by kuasta
their order which has endured for at least five hundred years believes that all knowledge is ** a hint of a smile lent jeod is features a mysterious cast
