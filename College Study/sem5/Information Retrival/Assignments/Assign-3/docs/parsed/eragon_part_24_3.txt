they re being forced to send goods by land
it is driven costs painfully high and their caravans do not always make it
do you have any idea who is responsible there must be witnesses said brom
martin shook his head
no one survives the attacks
ships go out then disappear they re never seen ** he leaned toward them and said in a confidential tone the sailors are saying that it is ** he nodded and winked then leaned back
brom seemed worried by his words
what do you think
martin shrugged carelessly
i do not know
and i do not think i will unless i am unfortunate enough to be on one of those captured ships
are you a sailor asked eragon
no snorted martin
do i look like one the captains hire me to defend their ships against pirates
and those thieving scum have not been very active lately
still it is a good job
but a dangerous one said brom
martin shrugged again and downed the last of his beer
brom and eragon took their leave and headed to the west side of the city a nicer section of teirm
the houses were clean ornate and large
the people in the streets wore expensive finery and walked with authority
eragon felt conspicuous and out of place
