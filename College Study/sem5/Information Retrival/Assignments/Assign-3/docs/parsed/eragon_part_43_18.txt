their sinuous forms wove together like twisting ropes of windblown smoke
eragon could never remember how long they fought
it was timeless filled with nothing but action and reaction
zar roc grew leaden in his hand his arm burned ferociously with each stroke
at last as he lunged forward arya nimbly sidestepped sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with supernatural speed
eragon froze as the icy metal touched his skin
his muscles trembled from the exertion
dimly he heard saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them
arya lowered her sword and sheathed it
you have passed she said quietly amid the noise
dazed he slowly straightened
fredric was beside him now thumping his back enthusiastically
that was incredible ** i even learned some new moves from watching the two of you
and the elf **
but i lost he protested silently
orik praised his performance with a broad smile but all eragon noticed was arya standing alone and silent
she motioned slightly with a finger no more than a twitch toward a knoll about a mile from the practice field then turned and walked away
the crowd melted before her
a hush fell over the men and dwarves as she passed
eragon turned to orik
i have to go
i will return to the dragonhold ** with a swift jab eragon sheathed zar roc and pulled himself onto saphira
she took off over the training field which turned into a sea of faces as everyone looked at her
as they soared toward the knoll eragon saw arya running below them with clean easy strides
saphira commented you find her form pleasing do you not
her face does have more character than that of most humans she ** it is long like a horse is and overall she is rather shapeless
eragon looked at saphira with ** re jealous are not you
impossible
i never get jealous she said offended
you are now admit ** laughed
she snapped her jaws together ** am ** he smiled and shook his head but let her denial stand
she landed heavily on the knoll jostling him roughly
he jumped down without remarking on it
arya was close behind them
her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner eragon had seen
when she reached the top of the knoll her breathing was smooth and regular
suddenly tongue tied eragon dropped his gaze
she strode past him and said to saphira skulblaka eka celobra ono un mulabra ono un onr shur tugal ne haina
atra nosu waise fricai
eragon did not recognize most of the words but saphira obviously understood the message
she shuffled her wings and surveyed arya curiously
then she nodded humming deeply
arya smiled
i am glad that you recovered eragon said
we did not know if you would live or not
that is why i came here today said arya facing him
her rich voice was accented and exotic
she spoke clearly with a hint of trill as if she were about to sing
i owe you a debt that must be repaid
you saved my life
that can never be forgotten
it it was nothing said eragon fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true even as he spoke them
embarrassed he changed the subject
how did you come to be in gil ead
pain shadowed arya is face
she looked away into the distance
let us ** they descended from the knoll and meandered toward farthen dur
eragon respected arya is silence as they walked
saphira padded quietly beside them
finally arya lifted her head and said with the grace of her kind ajihad told me you were present when saphira is egg appeared
** for the first time eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the egg over the dozens of leagues that separated du weldenvarden from the spine
to even attempt such a feat was courting disaster if not death
her next words were heavy
then know this at the moment you first beheld it i was captured by ** her voice filled with bitterness and grief
it was he who led the urgals that ambushed and slew my companions faolin and glenwing
somehow he knew where to wait for us we had no warning
i was drugged and transported to gil ead
there durza was charged by galbatorix to learn where i had sent the egg and all i knew of ellesmera
she stared ahead icily jaw clenched
