eragon searched the uneven field of roots for any sign of a weapon but as before he found no object he would consider carrying into battle
he pried a loose slab of bark from the moss at his feet and held it up to saphira
what do you think he asked
if i imbued it with enough spells could i kill a soldier with this
you could kill a soldier with a blade of grass if you wanted to she answered
however against murtagh and thorn or the king and his black dragon you might as well attack them with a strand of wet wool as that bark
you re right he said and tossed it away
it seems to me she said that you should not need to make a fool of yourself in order for solembum is advice to prove true
no but perhaps i should approach the problem differently if i am going to find this weapon
as you pointed out before it could just as easily be a stone or a book as a blade of some sort
a staff carved from the branch of the menoa tree would be a worthy weapon i would think
but hardly equal to a sword
no
and i would not dare lop off a branch without permission from the tree herself and i have no idea how i could go about convincing her to grant my request
saphira arched her sinuous neck and gazed upward at the tree then shook her head and shoulders to rid herself of the droplets that had accumulated on the sharp edges of her faceted scales
as the spray of cold water struck him eragon yelped and jumped backward shielding his face with his arm
if any creature tried to harm the menoa tree she said i doubt they would live long enough to regret their mistake
for several more hours the two of them prowled the clearing
eragon continued to hope they would stumble across some nook or cranny among the knotted roots where they would find the exposed corner of a buried chest which would contain a sword
since murtagh has zar roc which is his father is sword eragon thought by all rights i ought to have the sword rhunon made for brom
it would be the right color too saphira added
his dragon my namesake was blue as well
at last in desperation eragon reached out with his mind toward the menoa tree and attempted to attract the attention of her slow moving consciousness to explain his search and ask for her help
but he might as well have been trying to communicate with the wind or the rain for the tree took no more notice of him than he would of an ant flailing its feelers by his boots
disappointed he and saphira left the menoa tree even as the rim of the sun kissed the horizon
from the clearing saphira flew to the center of ellesmera where she glided to a landing within the bedroom of the tree house the elves had given them to stay in
the house was a cluster of several globular rooms that rested in the crown of a sturdy tree several hundred feet above the ground
a meal of fruit vegetables cooked beans and bread was waiting for eragon in the dining room
after eating a little eragon curled up next to saphira on the blanket lined basin set into the floor ignoring the bed in preference for saphira is company
he lay there alert and aware of his surroundings while saphira sank into a deep sleep
from his place by her side eragon watched the stars rise and set above the moonlit forest and thought of brom and the mystery of his mother
late in the night he slipped into the trancelike state of his waking dreams and there he spoke with his parents
eragon could not hear what they said for his voice and theirs were muted and indistinct but somehow he was aware of the love and pride his parents felt for him and although he knew they were no more than phantoms of his restless mind ever after he treasured the memory of their affection
when the elves march to war saphira observed few remain behind
lord fiolr was waiting for them inside an arched hall illuminated by several floating werelights
his face was long and stern and angled more sharply than those of most elves so that his features reminded eragon of a thin bladed spear
he wore a robe of green and gold the collar of which flared high behind his head like the neck feathers of an exotic bird
