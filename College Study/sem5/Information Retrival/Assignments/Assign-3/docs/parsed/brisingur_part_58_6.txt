startled eragon swept brisingr upward and was about to strike his attacker is head from his shoulders when he realized that the holder of the dagger was a thin boy of no more than thirteen
eragon froze
that could be me he thought
i would have done the same if i were in his shoes
looking past the boy he saw a man and a woman standing in their nightgowns and knit caps clutching each other and staring at him with horror
a tremor ran through eragon
he lowered brisingr and with his free hand removed the dagger from the boy is now soft grip
if i were you eragon said and the loudness of his voice shocked him i would not go outside until the battle is ** he hesitated then added i am sorry
feeling ashamed he hurried from the shop and rejoined saphira
not far from the millinery shop eragon and saphira came across several of king orrin is men carrying gold candlesticks silver plates and utensils jewelry and an assortment of furnishings out of a well appointed mansion the men had broken into
eragon dashed a pile of rugs from the arms of one man
put these things ** he shouted to the entire group
we re here to help these people not steal from ** they are our brothers and sisters our mothers and fathers
i will let you off this once but spread the word that if you or anyone else goes looting i will have you strung up and whipped as the thieves you ** saphira growled emphasizing his point
under their watchful gaze the chastened warriors returned the spoils to the marble clad mansion
now eragon said to saphira maybe we can
** ** shouted a man running toward them from deeper within the city
his arms and armor identified him as one of the varden
eragon tightened his grip on brisingr
what
we need your help shadeslayer
and yours too **
they followed the warrior through feinster until they arrived at a large stone building
several dozen varden sat hunched behind a low wall in front of the building
they appeared relieved to see eragon and saphira
stay ** said one of the varden gesturing
there is a whole group of soldiers inside and they have bows aimed at us
eragon and saphira halted just out of sight of the building
the warrior who had brought them said we can not get at them
the doors and windows are blocked and they shoot at us if we try to chop our way in
eragon looked at saphira
shall i or shall you
i will attend to it she said and jumped into the air with a rush of spreading wings
the building shook windows shattering as saphira landed on the roof
eragon and the other warriors watched with awe as she fit the tips of her claws into the mortared grooves between the stones and snarling from the effort tore the building apart until she exposed the terrified soldiers whom she killed like a terrier kills rats
when saphira returned to eragon is side the varden edged away from her clearly frightened by her display of ferocity
she ignored them and began licking her paws cleaning the gore from her scales
have i ever told you how glad i am we re not enemies eragon asked
no but it is very sweet of you
the keep was an imposing structure
it was tall and square and adorned with numerous towers of differing height
the roof was made of slate so attackers could not set it on fire
in front of the keep was a large courtyard in which were several low outbuildings and a row of four catapults and encircling the lot was a thick curtain wall interspersed with smaller towers of its own
hundreds of soldiers manned the battlements and hundreds more teemed within the courtyard
the only way to enter the courtyard on the ground was through a wide arched passageway in the curtain wall which was closed off by both an iron portcullis and a set of thick oaken doors
several thousand of the varden stood pressed against the curtain wall striving to break through the portcullis with the battering ram they had brought from the main gate of the city or else to surmount the walls with grappling hooks and ladders which the defenders kept pushing away
flocks of whining arrows arched back and forth over the wall
neither side seemed to have the advantage
