roran allowed himself a grim smile
every man who rides with me has proved himself in battle many times over
an they all answer to you eh young stronghammer said clovis
he scratched his chin eyeing gedric delwin and the others who were new to narda
how many are with you
enough you say
i ** he waved a hand
never you mind me my tongue runs a league before my own common sense or so my father used to tell me
my first mate torson is at the chandler is now overseeing the purchase of goods and equipment
i understand you have feed for your livestock
then you d best fetch them
we can load them into the holds once the masts are up
throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon roran and the villagers with him labored to ferry the supplies which loring is sons had procured from the warehouse where it was stored into the sheds with the barges
as roran trudged across the gangplank to theedeline and lowered his bag of flour to the sailor waiting in the hold clovis observed most of this t aint feed stronghammer
no said roran
but it is ** he was pleased that clovis had the sense not to inquire further
when the last item had been stored away clovis beckoned to roran
you might as well go
me and the boys will handle the rest
just you remember to be at the docks three hours after dawn with every man jack you promised me or we will lose the tide
back in the foothills roran helped elain and the others prepare for departure
it did not take long as they were accustomed to breaking camp each morning
then he picked twelve men to accompany him to narda the next day
they were all good fighters but he asked the best like horst and delwin to remain with the rest of the villagers in case soldiers found them or the ra zac returned
once night fell the two groups parted
roran crouched on a boulder and watched horst lead the column of people down through the foothills toward the cove where they would wait for the barges
orval came up beside him and crossed his arms
do you think they will be safe stronghammer anxiety ran through his voice like a taut bowstring
though he too was worried roran said i do
i d bet you a barrel of cider that they will still be asleep when we put ashore tomorrow
you can have the pleasure of waking up nolla
how does that sound orval smiled at the mention of his wife and nodded appearing reassured
i hope i am ** remained on the boulder hunched like a bleak gargoyle until the dark line of villagers vanished from his sight
they woke an hour before sunrise when the sky had just begun to brighten with pale green and the damp night air numbed their fingers
roran splashed his face with water and then outfitted himself with his bow and quiver his ever present hammer one of fisk is shields and one of horst is spears
the others did likewise with the addition of swords obtained during the skirmishes in carvahall
running as fast as they dared down the hummocky hills the thirteen men soon arrived at the road to narda and shortly after that the town is main gate
to roran is dismay the same two soldiers who had troubled them earlier stood guard by the entrance
as before the soldiers lowered their poleaxes to block the way
there be quite a bit more of you this time observed the white haired man
and not all the same ones either
except for ** he focused on roran
i suppose you expect me to believe that the spear and shield be for pottery as well
no
we ve been hired by clovis to protect his barges from attack on the way to teirm
you mercenaries the soldiers burst out laughing
you said you were tradesmen
the white haired man scowled
you lie
i tried my hand at being a gentleman of fortune once
i spent more nights hungry than not

it seems too large for an expedition from a bunch of ** his eyes narrowed as he scrutinized roran is face
you look familiar

roran jabbed forward with his spear catching the white haired soldier in the throat
scarlet blood fountained
