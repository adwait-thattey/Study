saphira wriggled with satisfaction all the way from the base of her head to the tip of her tail
today was a perfect day
the heat of the sun made her feel as if she were lying in a nest of coals
her belly was full the sky was clear and there was nothing she needed to attend to besides watching for foes who might wish to fight which she did anyway as a matter of habit
her happiness had only one flaw but it was a profound flaw and the longer she considered it the more discontented she grew until she realized she was no longer satisfied she wished eragon were there to share the day with her
she growled and loosed a brief jet of blue flame from between her jaws searing the air in front of her then constricted her throat cutting off the stream of liquid fire
her tongue tingled from the flames that had run over it
when was eragon partner of her mind and heart eragon going to contact nasuada from tronjheim and ask for her saphira to join him she had urged him to obey nasuada and travel to the mountains higher than she could fly but now too long had passed and saphira felt cold and empty in her gut
there is a shadow in the world she thought
that is what has upset me
something is wrong with eragon
he is in danger or he was in danger recently
and i cannot help him
she was not a wild dragon
since she had hatched she had shared her entire life with eragon and without him she was only half herself
if he died because she was not there to protect him she would have no reason to continue living save for revenge
she knew she would tear his killers apart and then she would fly on the black city of the egg breaker traitor who had kept her imprisoned for so many decades and she would do her best to slay him no matter that it would mean certain death for her
saphira growled again and snapped at a tiny sparrow that was foolish enough to fly within range of her teeth
she missed and the sparrow darted past and continued on its way unmolested which only exacerbated her foul mood
for a moment she considered chasing the sparrow but then decided it was not worth bothering herself over such an inconsequential speck of bones and feathers
it would not even make a good snack
tilting on the wind and swinging her tail in the opposite direction to facilitate her turn she wheeled around studying the ground far below and all the small scurrying things that strove to hide from her hunter is eyes
even from her height of thousands of feet she could count the number of feathers on the back of a chicken hawk that was skimming the fields of planted wheat west of the jiet river
she could see the blur of brown fur as a rabbit dashed to the safety of its warren
she could pick out the small herd of deer cowering underneath the branches of the currant bushes clustered along a tributary of the jiet river
and she could hear the high pitched squeaks of frightened animals warning their brethren of her presence
their wavering cries gratified her it was only right that her food should fear her
if ever she should fear it she would know it was her time to die
a league farther upstream the varden were packed against the jiet river like a herd of red deer against the edge of a cliff
the varden had arrived at the crossing yesterday and since then perhaps a third of the men who were friends and the urgals who were friends and the horses she must not eat had forded the river
the army moved so slowly she sometimes wondered how humans ever had time to do anything other than travel considering how short their lives were
it would be much more convenient if they could fly she thought and wondered why they did not choose to
flying was so easy it never ceased to puzzle her why any creature would remain earthbound
even eragon retained his attachment to the soft hard ground when she knew he could join her in the sky at any time merely by uttering a few words in the ancient language
but then she did not always understand the actions of those who tottered about on two legs whether they had round ears pointed ears or horns or were so short she could squash them under her feet
