in addition to being masters of their chosen weapons whether they were the humans swords the dwarves axes or the urgals eccentric collection of instruments many of the warriors were skilled spellweavers
and they had all sworn their undying loyalty to her in the ancient language
since the day the nighthawks first assumed their duties they had not left nasuada alone with another person save for farica her handmaid
nasuada had sent them out of the pavilion because she knew her meeting with fadawar might lead to the type of bloodshed the nighthawks sense of duty would require them to prevent
even so she was not entirely defenseless
she had a dagger hidden in the folds of her dress and an even smaller knife in the bodice of her undergarments and the prescient witch child elva was standing just behind the curtain that backed nasuada is chair ready to intercede if need be
fadawar tapped his four foot long scepter against the ground
the chased rod was made of solid gold as was his fantastic array of jewelry gold bangles covered his forearms a breastplate of hammered gold armored his chest long thick chains of gold hung around his neck embossed disks of white gold stretched the lobes of his ears and upon the top of his head rested a resplendent gold crown of such huge proportions nasuada wondered how fadawar is neck could support the weight without buckling and how such a monumental piece of architecture remained fixed in place
it seemed one would have to bolt the edifice which was at least two and a half feet tall to its bony bedrock in order to keep it from toppling over
fadawar is men were garbed in the same fashion although less opulently
the gold they wore served to proclaim not only their wealth but also the status and deeds of each individual and the skill of their tribe is far famed craftsmen
as either nomads or city dwellers the dark skinned peoples of alagaesia had long been renowned for the quality of their jewelry which at its best rivaled that of the dwarves
nasuada owned several pieces of her own but she had chosen not to wear them
her poor raiment could not compete with fadawar is splendor
also she believed it would not be wise to affiliate herself with any one group no matter how rich or influential when she had to deal with and speak for all the differing factions of the varden
if she displayed partiality toward one or another her ability to control the whole lot of them would diminish
which was the basis of her argument with fadawar
fadawar again jabbed his scepter into the ground
blood is the most important ** first come your responsibilities to your family then to your tribe then to your warlord then to the gods above and below and only then to your king and to your nation if you have them
that is how unulukuna intended men to live and that is how we should live if we want to be happy
are you brave enough to spit on the shoes of the old one if a man does not help his family whom can he depend upon to help him friends are fickle but family is forever
you ask me said nasuada to give positions of power to your fellow kinsmen because you are my mother is cousin and because my father was born among you
this i would be happy to do if your kinsmen could fulfill those positions better than anyone else in the varden but nothing you have said thus far has convinced me that is so
and before you squander more of your gilt tongued eloquence you should know that appeals based upon our shared blood are meaningless to me
i would give your request greater consideration if ever you had done more to support my father than send trinkets and empty promises to farthen dur
only now that victory and influence are mine have you made yourself known to me
well my parents are dead and i say i have no family but myself
you are my people yes but nothing more
fadawar narrowed his eyes and lifted his chin and said a woman is pride is always without sense
you shall fail without our support
he had switched to his native language which forced nasuada to respond in kind
she hated him for it
