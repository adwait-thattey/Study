when you see an enemy coming at you with bone sticking out of his calf a javelin through his belly and half his face sheared away and he laughs at you it is a rare man who can stand his ground
my warriors panicked
they broke formation
it was utter confusion
slaughter
when the urgals and your warriors nasuada reached us they became caught up in the ** he shook his head
i ve never seen the like of it not even on the burning plains
nasuada is face had grown pale even with her dark skin
she looked at eragon and then arya
how could galbatorix have done this
it was arya who answered block most but not all of a person is ability to feel pain
leave just enough sensation so they know where they are and what they are doing but not so much that pain can incapacitate them
the spell would require only a small amount of energy
nasuada wet her lips
again speaking to orrin she said do you know how many we lost
a tremor racked orrin
he doubled over pressed a hand against his leg gritted his teeth and growled three hundred soldiers against
what was the size of the force you sent
two hundred swordsmen
a hundred spearmen
fifty archers
those plus the urgals plus my cavalry
say around a thousand strong
against three hundred foot soldiers on an open field
we slew every last one of the soldiers
what it cost us though
the king shook his head
we wo not know for sure until we count the dead but it looked to me as if three quarters of your swordsmen are gone
more of the spearmen
some archers
of my cavalry few remain fifty seventy
many of them were my friends
perhaps a hundred a hundred and fifty urgals dead
overall five or six hundred to bury and the better part of the survivors wounded
i do not know
i do not know
i do not his jaw going slack orrin slumped to the side and would have fallen off his horse if arya had not sprung forward and caught him
nasuada snapped her fingers summoning two of the varden from among the tents and ordered them to take orrin to his pavilion and then to fetch the king his healers
we have suffered a grievous defeat no matter that we exterminated the soldiers nasuada murmured
she pressed her lips together sorrow and despair mixed in equal portions in her expression
her eyes glimmered with unshed tears
stiffening her back she fixed eragon and saphira with an iron gaze
how fared it with the two of you she listened without moving while eragon described their encounter with murtagh and thorn
afterward she nodded
that you would be able to escape their clutches was all we dared hope
however you accomplished more than that
you proved that galbatorix has not made murtagh so powerful that we have no hope of defeating him
with a few more spellcasters to help you murtagh would have been yours to do with as you pleased
for that reason he will not dare confront queen islanzadi is army by himself i think
if we can gather enough spellcasters around you eragon i believe we can finally kill murtagh and thorn the next time they come to abduct the pair of you
do not you want to capture them eragon asked
i want a great number of things but i doubt i shall receive very many of them
murtagh and thorn may not be trying to kill you but if the opportunity presents itself we must kill them without hesitation
or do you see it otherwise
shifting her attention to arya nasuada asked did any of your spellweavers die during the contest
some fainted but they have all recovered thank you
nasuada took a deep breath and looked northward her eyes focused on infinity
eragon please inform trianna that i want du vrangr gata to figure out how to replicate galbatorix is spell
despicable as it is we must imitate galbatorix in this
we cannot afford not to
it wo not be practical for all of us to be unable to feel pain we would hurt ourselves far too easily but we should have a few hundred swordsmen volunteers who are immune to physical suffering
so many dead said nasuada
she twisted her reins in her hands
we have remained in one place for too long
it is time we force the empire onto the defensive ** she spurred battlestorm away from the carnage that lay before the camp the stallion tossing his head and gnawing on his bit
