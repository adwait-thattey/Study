gouts of hot blood spurted over his hand but the soldier did not seem to notice
the world exploded in blotches of pulsing colors as the soldier smashed roran is head against the ground
once
twice
three times
roran bucked his hips trying without success to throw the man off
blind and desperate he slashed at where he guessed the man is face to be and felt the dagger catch in soft flesh
he pulled the dagger back slightly then lunged in that direction feeling the impact as the tip of the blade struck bone
the pressure around roran is neck vanished
roran lay where he was his chest heaving then rolled over and vomited throat burning
still gasping and coughing he staggered upright and saw the soldier sprawled motionless next to him the dagger protruding from the man is left nostril
go for the ** shouted roran despite his raw throat
the **
he left the dagger buried in the soldier is nostril and retrieved his hammer from the trampled ground where it had fallen pausing long enough to also grab an abandoned spear which he held with his shield hand
jumping over the fallen soldier he ran toward halmar who was on foot as well and dueling three soldiers at once
before the soldiers noticed him roran bashed the two closest ones in the head so hard he split their helms
the third he left to halmar instead bounding over to the soldier whose sternum he had broken and whom he had left for dead
he found the man sitting against the wheel of a wagon spitting up clotted blood and struggling to string a bow
roran gored him through an eye with the spear
pieces of gray flesh clung to the blade of the spear as he pulled it free
an idea occurred to roran then
he threw the spear at a man in a red tunic on the other side of the nearest fire impaling him through the torso then slid the haft of his hammer under his belt and strung the soldier is bow
placing his back against a wagon roran began to shoot the soldiers rushing about the encampment attempting either to kill them with a lucky shot to the face the throat or the heart or to cripple them so his companions could more easily dispatch them
if nothing else he reasoned that an injured soldier might bleed to death before the fight ended
the initial confidence of the attack had faded into confusion
the varden were scattered and dismayed some on their steeds some on foot and most bloodied
at least five so far as roran could tell had died when soldiers they had thought slain had returned to assail them
how many soldiers were left it was impossible to tell in the throng of flailing bodies but roran could see that they still outnumbered the scant twenty five or so of the remaining varden
they could tear us into pieces with their bare hands while we try to hack them apart he realized
he searched with his eyes among the frenzy for snowfire and saw that the white horse had run farther down the river where he now stood by a willow tree nostrils flared and ears plastered flat against his skull
with the bow roran killed four more soldiers and wounded over a score
when he had only two arrows left he spotted carn standing on the other side of the camp dueling a soldier by the corner of a burning tent
drawing the bow until the fletching on the arrow tickled his ear roran shot the soldier in the chest
the soldier stumbled and carn decapitated him
roran tossed the bow aside and hammer in hand ran over to carn and shouted ca not you kill them with magic
for a moment carn could only pant then he shook his head and said every spell i cast was ** the light from the burning tent gilded the side of his face
roran cursed
together ** he cried and hefted his shield
shoulder to shoulder the two of them advanced upon the nearest group of soldiers a cluster of eight men surrounding three of the varden
the next few minutes were a spasm of flashing weapons tearing flesh and sudden pains for roran
the soldiers tired more slowly than ordinary men and they never shirked from an attack nor did they slacken in their efforts even when suffering from the most horrific injuries
the exertion of the fight was so great roran is nausea returned and after the eighth soldier fell he leaned over and vomited again
