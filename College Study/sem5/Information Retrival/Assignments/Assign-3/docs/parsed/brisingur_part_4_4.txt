no one he said
reaching deep within himself to the place where he could touch the flow of magic he uttered the words brisingr ** a pale red werelight popped into existence several feet in front of him and remained there floating at eye level and painting the hollow with a watery radiance
he moved slightly and the werelight mimicked his motion as if connected to him by an invisible pole
together he and roran advanced toward where they d heard the sound down the gulch that wound eastward
they held their weapons high and paused between each step ready to defend themselves at any moment
about ten yards from their camp roran held up a hand stopping eragon then pointed at a plate of shale that lay on top of the grass
it appeared conspicuously out of place
kneeling roran rubbed a smaller fragment of shale across the plate and created the same steely scrape they had heard before
it must have fallen said eragon examining the sides of the gulch
he allowed the werelight to fade into oblivion
roran nodded and stood brushing dirt from his pants
as he walked back to saphira eragon considered the speed with which they had reacted
his heart still contracted into a hard painful knot with each beat his hands shook and he felt like dashing into the wilderness and running several miles without stopping
we would not have jumped like that before he thought
the reason for their vigilance was no mystery every one of their fights had chipped away at their complacency leaving behind nothing but raw nerves that twitched at the slightest touch
roran must have been entertaining similar thoughts for he said do you see them
the men you ve killed
do you see them in your dreams
the pulsing glow from the coals lit roran is face from below forming thick shadows above his mouth and across his forehead and giving his heavy half lidded eyes a baleful aspect
he spoke slowly as if he found the words difficult
i never wanted to be a warrior
i dreamed of blood and glory when i was younger as every boy does but the land was what was important to me
that and our family
and now i have killed
i have killed and killed and you have killed even ** his gaze focused on some distant place only he could see
there were these two men in narda
did i tell you this before
he had but eragon shook his head and remained silent
they were guards at the main gate
two of them you know and the man on the right he had pure white hair
i remember because he could not have been more than twenty four twenty five
they wore galbatorix is sigil but spoke as if they were from narda
they were not professional soldiers
they were probably just men who had decided to help protect their homes from urgals pirates brigands
we were not going to lift a finger against them
i swear to you eragon that was never part of our plan
i had no choice though
they recognized me
i stabbed the white haired man underneath his chin
it was like when father cut the throat of a pig
and then the other i smashed open his skull
i can still feel his bones giving way
i remember every blow i ve landed from the soldiers in carvahall to the ones on the burning plains
you know when i close my eyes sometimes i can not sleep because the light from the fire we set in the docks of teirm is so bright in my mind
i think i am going mad then
eragon found his hands gripping the staff with such force his knuckles were white and tendons ridged the insides of his wrists
aye he said
at first it was just urgals then it was men and urgals and now this last battle
i know what we do is right but right does not mean easy
because of who we are the varden expect saphira and me to stand at the front of their army and to slaughter entire battalions of soldiers
we do
we ** his voice caught and he fell silent
turmoil accompanies every great change said saphira to both of them
and we have experienced more than our share for we are agents of that very change
i am a dragon and i do not regret the deaths of those who endanger us
killing the guards in narda may not be a deed worthy of celebration but neither is it one to feel guilty about
