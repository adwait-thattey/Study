as soon as he was sure the spell had taken hold eragon closed and locked the cell door again and replaced his wards around it
what are you up to eragon asked saphira
wait until we re together again
i will explain then
explain what you do not have a plan
give me a minute and i will
what was in there asked roran as eragon took his place opposite him
** eragon adjusted his grip on the door between them
he is dead
looks like they broke his neck
for an instant eragon feared that roran might not believe him
then his cousin grunted and said it is better that way i suppose
ready one two three
together they heaved the massive door out of its casing and threw it across the hallway
the stone passageway returned the resulting boom to them again and again
without pause roran rushed into the cell which was lit by a single wax taper
eragon followed a step behind
katrina cowered at the far end of an iron cot
let me alone you toothless ** i she stopped struck dumb as roran stepped forward
her face was white from lack of sun and streaked with filth yet at that moment a look of such wonder and tender love blossomed upon her features eragon thought he had rarely seen anyone so beautiful
never taking her eyes off roran katrina stood and with a shaking hand touched his cheek
a laughing sob broke out of roran and he folded her in his arms pulling her against his chest
they remained lost in their embrace for a long moment
drawing back roran kissed her three times on the lips
katrina wrinkled her nose and exclaimed you grew a ** of all the things she could have said that was so unexpected and she sounded so shocked and surprised that eragon chuckled in response
for the first time katrina seemed to notice him
she glanced him over then settled on his face which she studied with evident puzzlement
eragon is that you
he is a dragon rider now said roran
a rider you mean
she faltered the revelation seemed to overwhelm her
glancing at roran as if for protection she held him even closer and sidled around him away from eragon
to roran she said how
how did you find us who else is with you
all that later
we have to get out of helgrind before the rest of the empire comes running after us
** what about my father did you find him
roran looked at eragon then returned his gaze to katrina and gently said we were too late
a shiver ran through katrina
she closed her eyes and a solitary tear leaked down the side of her face
so be it
while they spoke eragon frantically tried to figure out how to dispose of sloan although he concealed his deliberations from saphira he knew that she would disapprove of the direction his thoughts were taking
a scheme began to form in his mind
it was an outlandish concept fraught with danger and uncertainty but it was the only viable path given the circumstances
abandoning further reflection eragon sprang into action
he had much to do in little time
** he cried pointing
with a burst of blue sparks and flying fragments the metal bands riveted around katrina is ankles broke apart
katrina jumped in surprise
magic
she whispered
a simple ** she shrank from his touch as he reached toward her
katrina i have to make sure that galbatorix or one of his magicians has not enchanted you with any traps or forced you to swear things in the ancient language
roran interrupted her ** do this when we make camp
we can not stay here
** eragon slashed his arm through the air
we do it now
scowling roran moved aside and allowed eragon to put his hands on katrina is shoulders
just look into my eyes he told her
she nodded and obeyed
that was the first time eragon had a reason to use the spells oromis had taught him for detecting the work of another spellcaster and he had difficulty remembering every word from the scrolls in ellesmera
the gaps in his memory were so serious that on three different instances he had to rely upon a synonym to complete an incantation
for a long while eragon stared into katrina is glistening eyes and mouthed phrases in the ancient language occasionally and with her permission examining one of her memories for evidence that someone had tampered with it
