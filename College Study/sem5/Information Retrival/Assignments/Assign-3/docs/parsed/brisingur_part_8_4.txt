and while eragon was reluctant to admit it he enjoyed having control over a man who had often made trouble for him and also tormented him with gibes insulting both him and his family
he withdrew a half minute later
sloan continued to quiver but he did not collapse and grovel as eragon thought he might
instead the butcher is demeanor became cold and flinty
blast you he said
i do not have to explain myself to you eragon son of none
understand this though i did what i did for katrina is sake and nothing else
i know
that is the only reason you re still alive
do what you want with me then
i do not care so long as she is safe
well go ** what is it to be a beating a branding they already had my eyes so one of my hands or will you leave me to starve or to be recaptured by the empire
sloan nodded with a sharp motion and pulled his tattered clothes tight around his limbs to ward off the night cold
he sat with military precision gazing with blank empty eye sockets into the shadows that ringed their camp
he did not beg
he did not ask for mercy
he did not deny his acts or attempt to placate eragon
he but sat and waited armored by his perfect stoic fortitude
the dark landscape around them seemed immense beyond reckoning to eragon and he felt as if the entire hidden expanse was converging upon him a notion that heightened his anxiety over the choice that confronted him
my verdict will shape the rest of his life he thought
abandoning for the moment the question of punishment eragon considered what he knew about sloan the butcher is overriding love for katrina obsessive selfish and generally unhealthy as it was although it had once been something wholesome his hate and fear of the spine which were the offspring of his grief for his late wife ismira who had fallen to her death among those cloud rending peaks his estrangement from the remaining branches of his family his pride in his work the stories eragon had heard about sloan is childhood and eragon is own knowledge of what it was like to live in carvahall
eragon took that collection of scattered fragmented insights and turned them over in his mind pondering their significance
like the pieces of a puzzle he tried to fit them together
he rarely succeeded but he persisted and gradually he traced a myriad of connections between the events and emotions of sloan is life and thereby he wove a tangled web the patterns of which represented who sloan was
throwing the last line of his web eragon felt as if he finally comprehended the reasons for sloan is behavior
because of that he empathized with sloan
more than empathy he felt he understood sloan that he had isolated the core elements of sloan is personality those things one could not remove without irrevocably changing the man
there occurred to him then three words in the ancient language that seemed to embody sloan and without thinking about it eragon whispered the words under his breath
the sound could not have reached sloan yet he stirred his hands gripping his thighs and his expression became one of unease
a cold tingle crawled down eragon is left side and goosebumps appeared on his arms and legs as he watched the butcher
he considered a number of different explanations for sloan is reaction each more elaborate than the last but only one seemed plausible and even it struck him as being unlikely
he whispered the trio of words again
as before sloan shifted in place and eragon heard him mutter
someone walking on my grave
eragon released a shaky breath
it was difficult for him to believe but his experiment left no room for doubt he had quite by accident chanced upon sloan is true name
the discovery left him rather bewildered
knowing someone is true name was a weighty responsibility for it granted you absolute power over that person
because of the inherent risks the elves rarely revealed their true names and when they did it was only to those whom they trusted without reservation
eragon had never learned anyone is true name before
he had always expected that if he did it would be as a gift from someone he cared about a great deal
