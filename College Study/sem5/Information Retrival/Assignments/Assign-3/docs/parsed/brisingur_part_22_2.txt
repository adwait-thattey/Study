that means a sword of medium length easy to wield with one arm
it has to be a blade you can wear at all occasions elegant enough for a coronation and tough enough to fend off a band of ** he grimaced
it is not natural what nasuada is done allying us with those monsters
it can not last
the likes of us and them were never meant to mix
he shook himself
it is a pity you only want a single sword
or am i mistaken
no
saphira and i travel far too much to be lugging around a half dozen blades
i suppose you re right
besides a warrior like you is not expected to have more than one weapon
the curse of the named blade i call it
every great warrior said fredric wields a sword it is usually a sword that has a name
either he names it himself or once he proves his prowess with some extraordinary feat the bards name it for him
thereafter he has to use that sword
it is expected of him
if he shows up to a battle without it his fellow warriors will ask where it is and they will wonder if he is ashamed of his success and if he is insulting them by rejecting the acclaim they have bestowed upon him and even his enemies may insist upon waiting to fight until he fetches his famed blade
just you watch as soon as you fight murtagh or do anything else memorable with your new sword the varden will insist upon giving it a title
and they will look to see it on your hip from then ** he continued speaking while he proceeded to a third rack i never thought i would be fortunate enough to help a rider choose his weapon
what an ** it feels as if this is a culmination of my work with the varden
plucking a sword from the rack fredric handed it to eragon
eragon tilted the tip of the sword up and down then shook his head the shape of the hilt was wrong for his hand
the weapon master did not seem disappointed
to the contrary eragon is rejection seemed to invigorate him as if he relished the challenge eragon posed
he presented another sword to eragon and again eragon shook his head the balance was too far forward for his liking
what worries me fredric said returning to the rack is that any sword i give you will have to withstand impacts that would destroy an ordinary blade
what you need is dwarf work
their smiths are the finest besides the elves and sometimes they even exceed ** fredric peered at eragon
hold now i ve been asking the wrong ** how was it you were taught to block and parry was it edge on edge i seem to recall you doing something of the kind when you dueled arya in farthen dur
what of it fredric guffawed
not to be disrespectful shadeslayer but if you hit the edge of a sword against that of another you will cause grave damage to both
that might not have been a problem with an enchanted blade like zar roc but you can not do it with any of the swords i have here not unless you want to replace your sword after every battle
an image flashed in eragon is mind of the chipped edges of murtagh is sword and he felt irritated with himself for having forgotten something so obvious
he had become accustomed to zar roc which never dulled never showed signs of wear and so far as he knew was impervious to most spells
he was not even sure it was possible to destroy a rider is sword
you need not worry about that i will protect the sword with magic
must i wait all day for a weapon
one more question shadeslayer
will your magic last forever
eragon is frown deepened
since you ask no
only one elf understands the making of a rider is sword and she has not shared her secrets with me
what i can do is transfer a certain amount of energy into a sword
the energy will keep it from getting damaged until the blows that would have damaged the sword exhaust the store of energy at which point the sword will revert to its original state and odds are shatter in my grip the next time i close with my opponent
fredric scratched his beard
i will take your word for it shadeslayer
the point being if you hammer on soldiers long enough you will wear out your spells and the harder you hammer the sooner the spells will vanish
eh
then you should still avoid going edge on edge as it will wear out your spells faster than most any other move
