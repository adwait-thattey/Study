since then eragon has abided by our laws and traditions to the best of his knowledge and he has sought to learn ever more about our culture so that he may honor the true meaning of his oath
when hrothgar fell struck down by the traitor murtagh eragon swore to me upon every stone in alagaesia and also as a member of durgrimst ingeitum that he would strive to avenge hrothgar is death
he has given me the respect and obedience i am due as grimstborith and i am proud to regard him as mine foster brother
eragon glanced downward his cheeks and the tips of his ears burning
he wished orik were not so free with his praise it would only make his position harder to maintain in the future
sweeping his arms out to include the other clan chiefs orik exclaimed everything we could have ever wished for in a dragon rider we have received in ** he ** he is ** and he has embraced our people as no other dragon rider ever ** then orik lowered his arms and with them the volume of his voice until eragon had to strain to hear his words
how have we responded to his friendship though in the main with sneers and slights and surly resentment
we are an ungrateful race i say and our memories are too long for our own good
there are even those who have become so filled with festering hatred they have turned to violence to slake the thirst of their anger
perhaps they still believe they are doing what is best for our people but if so then their minds are as moldy as a lump of year old cheese
otherwise why would they try to kill eragon
the listening clan chiefs became perfectly still their eyes riveted to orik is face
so intense was their concentration the corpulent grimstborith freowin had set aside his carving of a raven and folded his hands on top of his ample belly appearing for all the world like one of the dwarves statues
as they gazed at him with unblinking eyes orik related to the clanmeet how the seven black clad dwarves had attacked eragon and his guards while they were meandering among the tunnels underneath tronjheim
then orik told them of the braided horsehair bracelet set with amethyst cabochons that eragon is guards had found upon one of the corpses
do not think to blame this attack upon mine clan based upon such paltry ** exclaimed vermund bolting upright
one can buy similar trinkets in most every market of our **
quite so said orik and inclined his head toward vermund
in a dispassionate voice and with a quick pace orik proceeded to tell his audience as he had told eragon the previous night how his subjects in dalgon had confirmed for him that the strange flickering daggers the assassins had wielded had been forged by the smith kiefna and also how his subjects had discovered that the dwarf who had bought the weapons had arranged for them to be transported from dalgon to one of the cities held by az sweldn rak anhuin
uttering a low growling oath vermund leaped to his feet again
those daggers might never have reached our city and even if they did you can draw no conclusions from that ** knurlan of many clans stay within our walls as they do within the walls of bregan hold for example
it signifies nothing
be careful what you say next grimstborith orik for you have no grounds upon which to level accusations against mine clan
i was of the same opinion as you grimstborith vermund orik replied
therefore last night my spellcasters and i retraced the assassins path back to their place of origin and on the twelfth level of tronjheim we captured three knurlan who were hiding in a dusty storeroom
we broke the minds of two of them and from them we learned they provisioned the assassins for their attack
and said orik his voice growing harsh and terrible from them we learned the identity of their master
i name you grimstborith ** i name you murderer and oath breaker
i name you an enemy of durgrimst ingeitum and i name you a traitor to your kind for it was you and your clan who attempted to kill **
the clanmeet erupted into chaos as every clan chief except orik and vermund began to shout and wave their hands and otherwise attempt to dominate the conversation
