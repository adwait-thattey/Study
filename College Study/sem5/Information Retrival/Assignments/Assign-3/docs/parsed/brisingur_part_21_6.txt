eragon is throat constricted as he spoke of brom is last hours of the cool sandstone cave where he had lain of the feelings of helplessness that had assailed eragon as he watched brom slipping away of the smell of death that had pervaded the dry air of brom is final words of the sandstone tomb eragon had made with magic and of how saphira had transformed it into pure diamond
if only i had known what i know now eragon said then i could have saved him
instead
unable to summon words past the tightness in his throat he wiped his eyes and gulped at his tea
he wished it were something stronger
a sigh escaped jeod
and so ended brom
alas we are all far worse off without him
if he could have chosen the means of his death though i think he would have chosen to die like this in the service of the varden defending the last free dragon rider
were you aware that he had been a rider himself
jeod nodded
the varden told me before i met him
he seemed as if he was a man who revealed little about himself observed helen
jeod and eragon laughed
that he was said jeod
i still have not recovered from the shock of seeing him and you eragon standing on our doorstep
brom always kept his own counsel but we became close friends when we were traveling together and i cannot understand why he let me believe he was dead for what sixteen seventeen years too long
what is more since it was brom who delivered saphira is egg to the varden after he slew morzan in gil ead the varden could not very well tell me they had her egg without revealing that brom was still alive
so i ve spent the better part of two decades convinced that the one great adventure of my life had ended in failure and that as a result we had lost our only hope of having a dragon rider to help us overthrow galbatorix
the knowledge was no easy burden i can assure you
with one hand jeod rubbed his brow
when i opened our front door and realized whom i was looking at i thought that the ghosts of my past had come to haunt me
brom said he kept himself hidden to ensure that he would still be alive to train the new rider when he or she should appear but his explanation has never entirely satisfied me
why was it necessary for him to cut himself off from nearly everyone he knew or cared about what was he afraid of what was he protecting
jeod fingered the handle of his mug
i cannot prove it but it seems to me that brom must have discovered something in gil ead when he was fighting morzan and his dragon something so momentous it moved brom to abandon everything that was his life up until then
it is a fanciful conjecture i admit but i cannot account for brom is actions except by postulating that there was a piece of information he never shared with me nor another living soul
again jeod sighed and he drew a hand down his long face
after so many years apart i had hoped brom and i might ride together once more but fate had other ideas it seems
and then to lose him a second time but a few weeks after discovering he was still alive was a cruel joke for the world to ** helen swept past eragon and went to stand by jeod touching him on the shoulder
he offered her a wan smile and wrapped an arm around her narrow waist
i am glad that you and saphira gave brom a tomb even a dwarf king might envy
he deserved that and more for all he did for alagaesia
although once people discover his grave i have a horrible suspicion they will not hesitate to break it apart for the diamond
if they do they will regret it muttered eragon
he resolved to return to the site at the earliest opportunity and place wards around brom is tomb to protect it from grave robbers
besides they will be too busy hunting gold lilies to bother brom
nothing
it is not ** the three of them sipped their tea
helen nibbled on a biscuit
then eragon asked you met morzan did not you
they were not the friendliest of occasions but yes i met him
as a person i really could not say although i am well acquainted with tales of his atrocities
every time brom and i crossed paths with him he was trying to kill us
or rather capture torture and then kill us none of which are conducive to establishing a close ** eragon was too intent to respond to jeod is humor
