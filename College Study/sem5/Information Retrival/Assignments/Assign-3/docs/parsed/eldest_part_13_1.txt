three days after the ra zac is arrival roran found himself pacing uncontrollably along the edge of his camp in the spine
he had heard nothing since albriech is visit nor was it possible to glean information by observing carvahall
he glared at the distant tents where the soldiers slept then continued pacing
at midday roran had a small dry lunch
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he wondered how long are the ra zac willing to wait if it was a test of patience he was determined to win
to pass the time he practiced his archery on a rotting log stopping only when an arrow shattered on a rock embedded in the trunk
after that nothing else remained to do except to resume striding back and forth along the bare track that stretched from a boulder to where he slept
he was still pacing when footsteps sounded in the forest below
grabbing his bow roran hid and waited
relief rushed through him when baldor is face bobbed into view
roran waved him over
as they sat roran asked why has not anyone come
we could not said baldor wiping sweat off his brow
the soldiers have been watching us too closely
this was the first opportunity we had to get away
i can not stay long ** he turned his face toward the peak above them and shuddered
you re braver than i staying here
have you had any trouble with wolves bears mountain cats
no no i am fine
did the soldiers say anything new
one of them bragged to morn last night that their squad was handpicked for this ** roran frowned
they have not been too quiet
at least two or three of them get drunk each night
a group of them tore up morn is common room the first day
did they pay for the damage
roran shifted staring down at the village
i still have trouble believing that the empire would go to these lengths to capture me
what could i give them what do theythink i can give them
baldor followed his gaze
the ra zac questioned katrina today
someone mentioned that the two of you are close and the ra zac were curious if she knew where you d gone
roran refocused on baldor is open face
is she all right
it would take more than those two to scare her reassured baldor
his next sentence was cautious and probing
perhaps you should consider turning yourself in
i d sooner hang myself and them with ** roran started up and stalked over his usual route still tapping his leg
how can you say that knowing how they tortured my father
catching his arm baldor said what happens if you remain in hiding and the soldiers do not give up and leave they will assume we lied to help you escape
the empire does not forgive traitors
roran shrugged off baldor
he spun around tapping his leg then abruptly ** do not show myself the ra zac will blame the people at hand
if i attempt to lead the ra zac away
roran was not a skilled enough woodsman to evade thirty men and the ra ** could do it but not me
still unless the situation changed it might be the only choice available to him
he looked at baldor
i do not want anyone to be hurt on my behalf
i will wait for now and if the ra zac grow impatient and threaten someone
well then i will think of something else to do
it is a nasty situation all around offered baldor
baldor departed soon afterward leaving roran alone with his thoughts on his endless path
he covered mile after mile grinding a rut into the earth under the weight of his ruminations
when chill dusk arrived he removed his boots for fear of wearing them out and proceeded to pad barefoot
just as the waxing moon rose and subsumed the night shadows in beams of marble light roran noticed a disturbance in carvahall
scores of lanterns bobbed through the darkened village winking in and out as they floated behind houses
the yellow specks clustered in the center of carvahall like a cloud of fireflies then streamed haphazardly toward the edge of town where they were met by a hard line of torches from the soldiers camp
for two hours roran watched the opposing sides face each other the agitated lanterns milling helplessly against the stolid torches
finally the lambent groups dispersed and filtered back into the tents and houses
