pushing himself off the ground roran did likewise with his own bedding
they looked at each other and shivered with excitement
if i die said roran you will see to katrina
tell her then that i went into battle with joy in my heart and her name upon my lips
eragon muttered a quick line in the ancient language
the drop in his strength that followed was almost imperceptible
there
that will filter the air in front of us and protect us from the paralyzing effects of the ra zac is breath
from his bags eragon removed his shirt of mail and unwrapped the length of sackcloth he had stored it in
blood from the fight on the burning plains still encrusted the once shining corselet and the combination of dried gore sweat and neglect had allowed blotches of rust to creep across the rings
the mail was however free of tears as eragon had repaired them before they had departed for the empire
eragon donned the leather backed shirt wrinkling his nose at the stench of death and desperation that clung to it then attached chased bracers to his forearms and greaves to his shins
upon his head he placed a padded arming cap a mail coif and a plain steel helm
he had lost his own helm the one he had worn in farthen dur and that the dwarves had engraved with the crest of durgrimst ingeitum along with his shield during the aerial duel between saphira and thorn
on his hands went mailed gauntlets
roran outfitted himself in a similar manner although he augmented his armor with a wooden shield
a band of soft iron wrapped around the lip of the shield the better to catch and hold an enemy is sword
no shield encumbered eragon is left arm the hawthorn staff required two hands to wield properly
across his back eragon slung the quiver given to him by queen islanzadi
in addition to twenty heavy oak arrows fletched with gray goose feathers the quiver contained the bow with silver fittings that the queen had sung out of a yew tree for him
the bow was already strung and ready for use
saphira kneaded the soil beneath her feet
let us be off
leaving their bags and supplies hanging from the branch of a juniper tree eragon and roran clambered onto saphira is back
they wasted no time saddling her she had worn her tack through the night
the molded leather was warm almost hot underneath eragon
he clutched the neck spike in front of him to steady himself during sudden changes in direction while roran hooked one thick arm around eragon is waist and brandished his hammer with the other
a piece of shale cracked under saphira is weight as she settled into a low crouch and in a single giddy bound leaped up to the rim of the gulch where she balanced for a moment before unfolding her massive wings
the thin membranes thrummed as saphira raised them toward the sky
vertical they looked like two translucent blue sails
sorry said roran
he loosened his embrace
further speech became impossible as saphira jumped again
when she reached the pinnacle she brought her wings down with a mighty whoosh driving the three of them even higher
with each subsequent flap they climbed closer to the flat narrow clouds
as saphira angled toward helgrind eragon glanced to his left and discovered that he could see a broad swath of leona lake some miles distant
a thick layer of mist gray and ghostly in the predawn glow emanated from the water as if witchfire burned upon the surface of the liquid
eragon tried but even with his hawklike vision he could not make out the far shore nor the southern reaches of the spine beyond which he regretted
it had been too long since he had laid eyes upon the mountain range of his childhood
to the north stood dras leona a huge rambling mass that appeared as a blocky silhouette against the wall of mist that edged its western flank
the one building eragon could identify was the cathedral where the ra zac had attacked him its flanged spire loomed above the rest of the city like a barbed spearhead
and somewhere in the landscape that rushed past below eragon knew were the remnants of the campsite where the ra zac had mortally wounded brom
