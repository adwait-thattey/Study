if they do not freeze they will be eaten
if they re not eaten
who knows they may **
roran spread his hands
if we all help they will have plenty of food
fire wo not be a problem if they move farther back into the forest which they must anyway since there is not room to camp right by the falls
what would you have us do sloan asked morn eyeing him with curiosity
it does not matter
only this is the wrong choice
you do not have to participate pointed out horst
nor will i said the butcher
proceed if you want but neither i nor my blood shall enter the spine while i still have marrow in my ** he grabbed his cap and left with a venomous glare at roran who returned the scowl in kind
as roran saw it sloan was endangering katrina through his own pigheaded ** he can not bring himself to accept the spine as a place of refuge decided roran then he is become my enemy and i have to take matters into my own hands
horst leaned forward on his elbows and interlaced his thick fingers
so
if we are going to use roran is plan what preparations will be needed the group exchanged wary glances then gradually began to discuss the topic
roran waited until he was convinced that he had achieved his goal before slipping out of the dining room
loping through the dusky village he searched for sloan along the inner perimeter of the tree wall
eventually he spotted the butcher hunched underneath a torch his shield clasped around his knees
roran spun around on one foot and ran to sloan is shop where he hurried to the kitchen in the back
katrina paused in the middle of setting their table and stared at him with amazement
** why are you here did you tell father
** he came forward and took her arm savoring the touch
just being in the same room with her filled him with joy
i have a great favor to ask of you
it is been decided to send the children and a few others into the spine above igualda ** katrina gasped
i want you to accompany them
with a shocked expression katrina pulled free of his grasp and turned to the open fireplace where she hugged herself and stared at the bed of throbbing embers
for a long time she said nothing
then father forbade me to go near the falls after mother died
albem is farm is the closest i ve been to the spine in over ten ** she shivered and her voice grew accusing
how can you suggest that i abandon both you and my father this is my home as much as yours
and why should i leave when elain tara and birgit will remain
katrina ** he tentatively put his hands on her shoulders
the ra zac are here for me and i would not have you harmed because of that
as long as you re in danger i can not concentrate on what has to be done defending carvahall
who would respect me for fleeing like a coward she lifted her chin
i would be ashamed to stand before the women of carvahall and call myself your wife
coward there is no cowardice in guarding and protecting the children in the spine
if anything it requires greater courage to enter the mountains than to stay
what horror is this whispered katrina
she twisted in his arms eyes shining and mouth set firmly
the man who would be my husband no longer wants me by his side
he shook his head
that is not true
i
itis ** what if you are killed while i am gone
** carvahall has little hope of survival and if we must die i would rather die together than huddle in the spine without life or heart
let those with children tend to their own
as will ** a tear rolled down her cheek
gratitude and wonder surged through roran at the strength of her devotion
he looked deep into her eyes
it is for that love that i would have you go
i know how you feel
i know that this is the hardest sacrifice either of us could make and i ask it of you now
katrina shuddered her entire body rigid her white hands clenched around her muslin sash
if i do this she said with a shaking voice you must promise me here and now that you will never make such a request again
you must promise that even if we faced galbatorix himself and only one of us could escape you would not ask me to leave
roran looked at her helplessly
i can not
