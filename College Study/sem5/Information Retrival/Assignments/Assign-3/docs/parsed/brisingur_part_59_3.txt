please you must stop them for the sake of my **
as she finished speaking saphira landed upon the balcony outside the room cracking the balustrade with her tail
she knocked aside the shutters with a single blow of her paw breaking their frames like so much tinder and then pushed her head and shoulders into the chamber and growled
the magicians continued to chant seemingly oblivious to her presence
oh my said lady lorana gripping the arms of her chair
right said eragon
he hefted brisingr and started toward the magicians as did saphira from the opposite direction
the world reeled around eragon and again he found himself peering through glaedr is eyes
glaedr regained his balance and looked for thorn
the little red shrike dragon was stronger and faster than glaedr had anticipated due to galbatorix is meddling
thorn slammed into glaedr is left side his weak side where he had lost his foreleg
they spun around each other plummeting toward the hard flat wing crushing ground
glaedr snapped and tore and raked with his hind feet trying to batter the smaller dragon into submission
you will not best me youngling he vowed to himself
i was old before you were born
white dagger claws scratched glaedr along his ribs and underside
he flexed his tail and struck snarling long fang thorn across one leg stabbing him in the thigh with a spike on his tail
the fighting had long since exhausted both of their invisible spell shields leaving them vulnerable to every sort of wound
when the twirling ground was only a few thousand feet away glaedr inhaled and drew back his head
he tightened his neck clenched his belly and drew forth the dense liquid of fire from deep within his gut
the liquid ignited as it combined with the air in his throat
he opened his jaws to their full extent and sprayed the red dragon with fire engulfing him in a blistering cocoon
the torrent of hungry grasping writhing flames tickled the inside of glaedr is cheeks
he closed off his throat terminating the flow of fire as he and the squirming squealing slash claw dragon pulled away from each other
from on his back glaedr heard oromis say their strength is fading i can see it in their bearing
another few minutes and murtagh is concentration shall fail and i will be able to assume control over his thoughts
that or we shall slay them with sword and **
glaedr growled in agreement frustrated that he and oromis dared not communicate with their minds as they usually did
rising on warm wind from tilled earth he turned toward thorn whose limbs dripped with crimson blood and roared and prepared to grapple with him once more
the three magicians still stood with their arms outstretched swaying and chanting in the ancient language
the words of their spell rang with unusual force and lingered in the air long after they should have faded to silence
the man who sat at their feet gripped his knees his entire body shuddering as he thrashed his head from side to side
what happened asked arya in a strained undertone
she pulled eragon closer and lowered her voice even further
how can you know what glaedr is thinking from so far away and when his mind is closed even to oromis forgive me for touching your thoughts without your permission eragon but i was worried about your welfare
what sort of a bond do you and saphira share with glaedr
later he said and squared his shoulders
did oromis give you an amulet or some other trinket that allows you to contact glaedr
it would take too long to explain
later i promise
arya hesitated then nodded and said i shall hold you to that
together eragon saphira and arya advanced toward the magicians and struck at a separate one each
a metallic peal filled the room as brisingr glanced aside before it reached its intended target wrenching eragon is shoulder
likewise arya is sword rebounded off a ward as did saphira is right front paw
her claws screeched against the stone floor
concentrate on this ** eragon shouted and pointed at the tallest spellcaster a pale man with a snarled beard
hurry before they manage to summon any ** eragon or arya could have attempted to circumvent or deplete the spellcasters wards with spells of their own but using magic against another magician was always a perilous proposition unless the magician is mind was under your control
