why yes
has not saphira ever blocked you from her mind
occasionally admitted eragon
when she took me into the spine i could not talk to her at all
it was not that she was ignoring me i do not think she could even hear me
there were walls around her mind that i could not get through
brom worked on his bandage for a moment shifting it higher on his arm
only a few people can tell if someone is in their mind and of those only a handful could stop you from entering
it is a matter of training and of how you think
because of your magical power you will always know if someone is in your mind
once you do blocking them is a simple matter of concentrating on one thing to the exclusion of all else
for instance if you only think about a brick wall that is all the enemy will find in your mind
however it takes a huge amount of energy and discipline to block someone for any length of time
if you re distracted by even the slightest thing your wall will waver and your opponent will slip in through the weakness
how can i learn to do this asked eragon
there is only one thing for it practice practice and yet more practice
picture something in your mind and hold it there to the exclusion of all else for as long as you can
it is a very advanced ability only a handful ever master it said brom
i do not need perfection just ** if i can get into someone is mind can i change how he thinks every time i learn something new about magic i grow more wary of it
when they reached saphira she startled them by thrusting her head at them
the horses backstepped nervously
saphira looked eragon over carefully and gave a low hiss
her eyes were flinty
eragon threw a concerned look at brom he had never seen saphira this angry then asked what is wrong
eragon frowned and got off cadoc
as soon as his feet touched the ground saphira swept his legs out from under him with her tail and pinned him with her talons
what are you doing he yelled struggling to get up but she was too strong for him
brom watched attentively from snowfire
saphira swung her head over eragon until they were eye to eye
he squirmed under her unwavering ** every time you leave my sight you get into trouble
you re like a new hatchling sticking your nose into everything
and what happens when you stick it into something that bites back how will you survive then i cannot help you when i am miles away
i ve stayed hidden so that no one would see me but no ** not when it may cost you your life
i can understand why you re upset said eragon but i am much older than you and can take care of myself
if anything you re the one who needs to be protected
she snarled and snapped her teeth by his ** you really believe that she ** you will ride me not that pitiful deer animal you call a horse or else i will carry you in my claws
are you a dragon rider or not do not you care for me
the question burned in eragon and he dropped his gaze
he knew she was right but he was scared of riding her
their flights had been the most painful ordeal he had ever endured
she wants me to ride her tomorrow said eragon lamely
brom considered it with twinkling eyes
well you have the saddle
i suppose that if the two of you stay out of sight it wo not be a ** saphira switched her gaze to him then returned it to eragon
but what if you re attacked or there is an accident i wo not be able to get there in time and
saphira pressed harder on his chest stopping his ** my point little one
brom seemed to hide a smile
it is worth the risk
you need to learn how to ride her anyway
think about it this way with you flying ahead and looking at the ground you will be able to spot any traps ambushes or other unwelcome surprises
eragon looked back at saphira and said okay i will do it
but let me up
is that really necessary he demanded
she ** well
i give you my word that i will fly with you tomorrow
satisfied
saphira let him up and with a push of her legs took off
a small shiver ran through eragon as he watched her twist through the air
grumbling he returned to cadoc and followed brom
it was nearly sundown when they made camp
