releasing the spear roran drew his hammer and twisted round as he blocked the second soldier is poleax with his shield
swinging his hammer up and around roran crushed the man is helm
he stood panting between the two ** i have killed ten
orval and the other men stared at roran with shock
unable to bear their gazes roran turned his back on them and gestured at the culvert that ran beneath the road
hide the bodies before anyone sees he ordered brusque and harsh
as they hurried to obey he examined the parapet on top of the wall for sentries
fortunately no one was visible there or in the street through the gate
he bent and pulled his spear free wiping the blade clean on a tuft of grass
done said mandel clambering out of the ditch
despite his beard the young man appeared pale
roran nodded and steeling himself faced his band
listen
we will walk to the docks at a quick but reasonable pace
we will not run
when the alarm is sounded and someone may have heard the clash just now act surprised and interested but not afraid
whatever you do give people no reason to suspect us
the lives of your families and friends depend on it
if we are attacked your only duty is to see the barges launched
nothing else matters
am i clear
as he strode through narda roran felt so tense he feared he might snap and explode into a thousand ** have i made of myself he wondered
he glanced from man to woman child to man man to dog in an effort to identify potential enemies
everything around him appeared unnaturally bright and filled with detail it seemed as if he could see the individual threads in people is clothing
they reached the docks without incident whereupon clovis said you be early stronghammer
i like that in a man
it will give us the opportunity to put things nice an shipshape before we head out
can we leave now asked roran
you should know better n that
have to wait till the tide is finished coming in so we ** clovis paused then taking his first good look at the thirteen of them and said why what d be the matter stronghammer the lot of you look as if you saw the ghost of old galbatorix himself
nothing a few hours of sea air wo not cure said roran
in his current state he could not smile but he did let his features assume a more pleasant expression in order to reassure the captain
with a whistle clovis summoned two sailors from the boats
both men were tanned the color of hazelnuts
this d be torson my first mate said clovis indicating the man to his right
torson is bare shoulder was decorated with a coiled tattoo of a flying dragon
he will be skipper of themerrybell
and this black dog is flint
he is in command of theedeline
while you are on board their word is law as is mine on thered boar
you will answer to them and me not stronghammer
well give me a properaye aye if you heard me
now which of you be my hands and which be my men at arms for the life of me i can not tell you apart
ignoring clovis is admonishment that he was their commander not roran the villagers looked at roran to see if they should obey
he nodded his approval and they divided into two factions which clovis proceeded to partition into even smaller groups as he assigned a certain number of villagers to each barge
for the next half hour roran worked alongside the sailors to finish preparing thered boar for departure ears open for the first hint of ** re going to be captured or killed if we stay much longer he thought checking the height of the water against the piers
he mopped sweat from his brow
roran started as clovis gripped his forearm
before he could stop himself roran pulled his hammer halfway out of his belt
the thick air clogged his throat
clovis raised an eyebrow at his reaction
i ve been watching you stronghammer and i d be interested to know how you won such loyalty from your men
i ve served with more captains than i care to recall an not one commanded the level of obedience you do without raising his pipes
roran could not help it he laughed
i will tell you how i did it i saved them from slavery and from being eaten
clovis is eyebrows rose almost to his hairline
