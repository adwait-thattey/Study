the games consisted of many events wrestling archery swordsmanship feats of strength and the current event the ghastgar
from opposite ends of a grassy field two dwarves rode toward each other on white feldunost
the horned mountain goats bounded across the sward each leap over seventy feet long
the dwarf on the right had a small buckler strapped to his left arm but carried no weapons
the dwarf on the left had no shield but in his right hand he held a javelin poised to throw
eragon held his breath as the distance between the feldunost narrowed
when they were less than thirty feet apart the dwarf with the spear whipped his arm through the air and launched the missile at his opponent
the other dwarf did not cover himself with his shield but rather reached out and with amazing dexterity caught the spear by the shaft
he brandished it over his head
the crowd gathered around the lists let out a resounding cheer which eragon joined in clapping vigorously
that was skillfully ** exclaimed orik
he laughed and drained his tankard of mead his polished coat of mail sparkling in the early evening light
he wore a helm embellished with gold silver and rubies and on his fingers five large rings
at his waist hung his ever present ax
hvedra was attired even more richly with strips of embroidered cloth upon her sumptuous dress strands of pearls and twisted gold around her neck and in her hair an ivory comb set with an emerald as large as eragon is thumb
a line of dwarves stood and winded a set of curved horns the brassy notes echoing off the mountains
then a barrel chested dwarf stepped forward and in dwarvish announced the winner of the last contest as well as the names of the next pair to compete in the ghastgar
when the master of ceremonies finished speaking eragon bent over and asked will you be accompanying us to farthen dur hvedra
she shook her head and smiled widely
i cannot
i must stay here and tend to the affairs of the ingeitum while orik is gone so he does not return to find our warriors starving and all our gold spent
chuckling orik held out his tankard toward one of the servants standing several yards away
as the dwarf hurried over and refilled it with mead from a pitcher orik said to eragon with obvious pride hvedra does not boast
she is not only my wife she is the
ach you have no word for it
she is the grimstcarvlorss of durgrimst ingeitum
grimstcarvlorss means
the keeper of the house the arranger of the ** it is her duty to ensure that the families of our clan pay their agreed upon tithes to bregan hold that our herds are driven to the proper fields at the proper times that our stocks of feed and grain do not fall too low that the women of the ingeitum weave enough fabric that our warriors are well equipped that our smiths always have ore to smelt into iron and in short that our clan is well managed and will prosper and thrive
there is a saying among our people a good grimstcarvlorss can make a clan
and a bad grimstcarvlorss will destroy a clan said hvedra
orik smiled and clasped one of her hands in his
and hvedra is the best of grimstcarvlorssn
it is not an inherited title
you must prove that you are worthy of the post if you are to hold it
it is rare for the wife of a grimstborith to be grimstcarvlorss as well
i am most fortunate in that ** bending their heads together he and hvedra rubbed noses
eragon glanced away feeling lonely and excluded
leaning back orik took a draught of mead then said there have been many famous grimstcarvlorssn in our history
it is often said that the only thing we clan leaders are good for is declaring war on each other and that the grimstcarvlorssn prefer we spend our time squabbling among ourselves so we do not have the time to interfere in the workings of the clan
come now skilfz delva chided hvedra
you know that is not truth
or it shall not be truth with us
mmm said orik and touched his forehead to hvedra is
they rubbed noses again
eragon returned his attention to the crowd below as it erupted in a frenzy of hissing and jeering
he saw that one of the dwarves competing in the ghastgar had lost his nerve and at the last moment had yanked his feldunost off to one side and even then was attempting to flee his opponent
