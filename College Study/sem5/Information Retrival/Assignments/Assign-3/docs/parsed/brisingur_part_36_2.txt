orik thought for a moment then nodded
you re right
the path is safe enough and no one would think to look for you among the deep dwellers
they would come here first and here they would otherwise find you
go and do not return until i send a messenger for you even if the family of mord turns you away and you must sit on a stalagmite until morn
but eragon be you careful the deep dwellers keep to themselves for the most part and they are prickly to an extreme about their honor and they have strange customs of their own
tread carefully as if you were on rotten shale eh
and so with thrand added to his guards and hundfast accompanying them and with a short dwarf sword belted around his waist eragon went to the nearest staircase leading downward and following it he descended farther into the bowels of the earth than ever he had before
and in due time he found glumra and informed her of kvistor is demise and now he sat listening as she grieved for her slain child alternating between wordless howls and scraps of dwarvish sung in a haunting dissonant key
discomfited by the strength of her sorrow eragon glanced away from her face
he looked at the green soapstone stove that stood against one wall and the worn carvings of geometric design that adorned its edges
he studied the green and brown rug that lay before the hearth and the churn in the corner and the provisions hanging from the beams of the ceiling
he gazed at the heavy timbered loom that stood underneath a round window with panes of lavender glass
then at the height of her wailing glumra caught eragon is eye as she rose from the table went to the counter and placed her left hand on the cutting board
before eragon could stop her she took a carving knife and cut off the first joint of her little finger
she groaned and doubled over
eragon sprang halfway up with an involuntary exclamation
he wondered what madness had overcome the dwarf woman and whether he should attempt to restrain her lest she should do herself additional harm
he opened his mouth to ask if she wanted him to heal the wound but then he thought better of it remembering orik is admonishments about the deep dwellers strange customs and strong sense of honor
she might consider the offer an insult he realized
closing his mouth he sank back into his too small chair
after a minute glumra straightened out of her hunched position took a deep breath and then quietly and calmly washed the raw end of her finger with brandy smeared it with a yellow salve and bandaged the wound
her moon face still pale from the shock she lowered herself into the chair opposite eragon
i thank you shadeslayer for bringing me news of mine son is fate yourself
i am glad to know that he died proudly as a warrior ought to
he was most brave eragon said
he could see that our enemies were as fast as elves and yet he still leaped forward to protect me
his sacrifice bought me time to escape their blades and also revealed the danger of the enchantments they had placed on their weapons
if not for his actions i doubt i would be here now
glumra nodded slowly eyes downcast and smoothed the front of her dress
do you know who was responsible for this attack on our clan shadeslayer
we have only suspicions
grimstborith orik is trying to determine the truth of the matter even as we speak
was it az sweldn rak anhuin glumra asked surprising eragon with the astuteness of her guess
he did his best to conceal his reaction
when he remained silent she said we all know of their blood feud with you argetlam every knurla within these mountains knows
some of us have looked with favor upon their opposition of you but if they thought to actually kill you then they have misjudged the lay of the rock and doomed themselves because of it
eragon raised an eyebrow interested
doomed how
it was you shadeslayer who slew durza and so allowed us to save tronjheim and the dwellings below from the clutches of galbatorix
our race shall never forget that so long as tronjheim remains standing
and then there is word come by the tunnels that your dragon shall make whole again isidar mithrim
