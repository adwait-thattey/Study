his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of approaching soldiers
apprehensive he went to the door and saw two soldiers dragging the elf down the hallway
when he could see her no more eragon slumped to the floor and tried to touch the magic again
oaths flew from his lips when it eluded his grasp
he looked out at the city and ground his teeth
it was only midafternoon
taking a calming breath he tried to wait patiently
