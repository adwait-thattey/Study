and why was it exactly you remained in those foul caverns
because there was something i had to investigate
when he failed to expand upon his answer roran is broad face hardened and for a moment eragon feared he would insist upon a more satisfactory explanation
but then roran said well what hope has an ordinary man like myself of understanding the whys and wherefores of a dragon rider even if he is my cousin all that matters is that you helped free katrina and you are here now safe and ** he craned his neck as if he were trying to see what lay on top of saphira then he looked at arya who was several yards behind them and said you lost my ** i crossed the entire breadth of alagaesia with that staff
could not you manage to hold on to it for more than a few days
it went to a man who needed it more than i said eragon
oh stop nipping at him katrina said to roran and after a moment is hesitation she hugged eragon
he is really very glad to see you you know
he just has difficulty finding the words to say it
with a sheepish grin roran shrugged
she is right about me as ** the two of them exchanged a loving glance
eragon studied katrina closely
her copper hair had regained its original luster and for the most part the marks left by her ordeal had faded away although she was still thinner and paler than normal
moving closer to him so none of the varden clustered around them could overhear she said i never thought that i would owe you so much eragon
that we would owe you so much
since saphira brought us here i have learned what you risked to rescue me and i am most grateful
if i had spent another week in helgrind it would have killed me or stripped me of reason which is a living death
for saving me from that fate and for repairing roran is shoulder you have my utmost thanks but more than that you have my thanks for bringing the two of us back together again
if not for you we never would have been reunited
somehow i think roran would have found a way to extricate you from helgrind even without me commented eragon
he has a silver tongue when roused
he would have convinced another spellcaster to help him angela the herbalist perhaps and he would have succeeded all the same
angela the herbalist scoffed roran
that prating girl would have been no match for the ra zac
you would be surprised
she is more than she appears
or ** then eragon dared to do something that he never would have attempted when he was living in palancar valley but that he felt was appropriate in his role as a rider he kissed katrina upon her brow and then he kissed roran upon his and he said roran you are as a brother to me
and katrina you are as a sister to me
if ever you are in trouble send for me and whether you need eragon the farmer or eragon the rider everything i am shall be at your disposal
and likewise said roran if ever you are in trouble you have but to send for us and we shall rush to your aid
eragon nodded acknowledging his offer and refrained from mentioning that the troubles he was most likely to encounter would not be of a sort either of them could assist him with
he gripped them both by the shoulders and said may you live long may you always be together and happy and may you have many ** katrina is smile faltered for a moment and eragon wondered at it
at saphira is urging they resumed walking toward nasuada is red pavilion in the center of the encampment
in due time they and the host of cheering varden arrived at its threshold where nasuada stood waiting king orrin to her left and scores of nobles and other notables gathered behind a double row of guards on either side
nasuada was garbed in a green silk dress that shimmered in the sun like the feathers on the breast of a hummingbird in bright contrast to the sable shade of her skin
the sleeves of the dress ended in lace ruffs at her elbows
white linen bandages covered the rest of her arms to her narrow wrists
of all the men and women assembled before her she was the most distinguished like an emerald resting on a bed of brown autumn leaves
only saphira could compete with the brilliance of her appearance
