do they behave like that because they know no one dares oppose them and they enjoy demonstrating their power wondered eragon
or because they were forced to join galbatorix is army and seek to dull their sense of shame and fear with their revels
the crowd shifted and granted eragon a view of a table pushed against one wall
at it sat a lone woman her face hidden by the drawn hood of her dark traveling cloak
four men surrounded her big beefy farmers with leathery necks and cheeks flushed with the fever of alcohol
two of them were leaning against the wall on either side of the woman looming over her while one sat grinning in a chair turned around backward and the fourth stood with his left foot on the edge of the table and was bent forward over his knee
the men spoke and gestured their movements careless
although eragon could not hear or see what the woman said it was obvious to him that her response angered the farmers for they scowled and swelled their chests puffing themselves up like roosters
one of them shook a finger at her
to eragon they appeared decent hardworking men who had lost their manners in the depths of their tankards a mistake he had witnessed often enough on feast days in carvahall
garrow had had little respect for men who knew they could not hold their beer and yet insisted on embarrassing themselves in public
it is unseemly he had said
what is more if you drink to forget your lot in life and not for pleasure you ought to do it where you wo not disturb anyone
the man to the left of the woman suddenly reached down and hooked a finger underneath the edge of her hood as if to toss it back
so quickly that eragon barely saw the woman lifted her right hand and grasped the man is wrist but then released it and returned to her previous position
eragon doubted that anyone else in the common room including the man she touched had noticed her actions
the hood collapsed around her neck and eragon stiffened astounded
the woman was human but she resembled arya
the only differences between them were her eyes which were round and level not slanted like a cat is and her ears which lacked the pointed tips of an elf is
she was just as beautiful as the arya eragon knew but in a less exotic more familiar way
without hesitation eragon probed toward the woman with his mind
he had to know who she really was
as soon as he touched her consciousness a mental blow struck back at eragon destroying his concentration and then in the confines of his skull he heard a deafening voice exclaim eragon
their eyes met for a moment before the crowd thickened again and hid her
eragon hurried across the room to her table prying apart the bodies packed close together to clear himself a path
the farmers looked askance at him when he emerged from the press and one said you re awful rude barging in on us uninvited like
best make yourself scarce eh
in as diplomatic a voice as he could muster eragon said it seems to me gentlemen that the lady would rather be left alone
now you would not ignore the wishes of an honest woman would you
an honest woman laughed the nearest man
no honest woman travels alone
then let me set your concern to rest for i am her brother and we are going to live with our uncle in dras leona
the four men exchanged uneasy glances
three of them began to edge away from arya but the largest planted himself a few inches in front of eragon and breathing upon his face said i am not sure i believe you friend
you re just trying to drive us away so you can be with her yourself
he is not far off thought eragon
speaking quietly enough that only that man could hear eragon said i assure you she is my sister
please sir i have no quarrel with you
wo not you go
not when i think you re a lying milksop
sir be reasonable
there is no need for this unpleasantness
the night is young and there is drink and music aplenty
let is not quarrel about such a petty misunderstanding
it is beneath us
to eragon is relief the other man relaxed after a few seconds and uttered a scornful grunt
i would not want to fight a youngling like you anyway he said
