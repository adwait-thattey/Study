eragon began to wonder if they would ever get around it so he was heartened when they met men who said that dras leona was an easy day is ride ahead of them
eragon rose early the following morning
his fingers twitched with anticipation at the thought of finally finding the ra ** two of you must be careful said ** ra zac could have spies watching for travelers that fit your description
we will do our best to remain inconspicuous he assured her
she lowered her head until their eyes ** but realize that i wo not be able to protect you as i did with the urgals
i will be too far away to come to your aid nor would i survive long in the narrow streets your kind favor
follow brom is lead in this hunt he is sensible
will you go with brom to the varden once the ra zac are killed he will want to take you to them
and since galbatorix will be enraged by the ra zac is death that may be the safest thing for us to do
eragon rubbed his ** do not want to fight the empire all the time like the varden do
life is more than constant war
there will be time to consider it once the ra zac are gone
do not be too sure she warned then went to hide herself until night
the road was clogged with farmers taking their goods to market in dras leona
brom and eragon were forced to slow their horses and wait for wagons that blocked the way
although they saw smoke in the distance before noon it was another league before the city was clearly visible
unlike teirm a planned city dras leona was a tangled mess that sprawled next to leona lake
ramshackle buildings sat on crooked streets and the heart of the city was surrounded by a dirty pale yellow wall of daubed mud
several miles east a mountain of bare rock speared the sky with spires and columns a tenebrous nightmare ship
near vertical sides rose out of the ground like a jagged piece of the earth is bone
brom pointed
thatis helgrind
it is the reason dras leona was originally built
people are fascinated by it even though it is an unhealthy and malevolent ** he gestured at the buildings inside the city is wall
we should go to the center of the city first
as they crept along the road to dras leona eragon saw that the highest building within the city was a cathedral that loomed behind the walls
it was strikingly similar to helgrind especially when its arches and flanged spires caught the light
who do they worship he asked
brom grimaced in distaste
their prayers go to helgrind
it is a cruel religion they practice
they drink human blood and make flesh offerings
their priests often lack body parts because they believe that the more bone and sinew you give up the less you re attached to the mortal world
they spend much of their time arguing about which of helgrind is three peaks is the highest and most important and whether the fourth and lowest should be included in their worship
yes said brom grimly but do not say that to a believer
you will quickly lose a hand in **
at dras leona is enormous gates they led the horses through the crush of people
ten soldiers were stationed on either side of the gates casually scanning the crowd
eragon and brom passed into the city without incident
the houses inside the city wall were tall and thin to compensate for the lack of space
those next to the wall were braced against it
most of the houses hung over the narrow winding streets covering the sky so that it was hard to tell if it was night or day
nearly all the buildings were constructed of the same rough brown wood which darkened the city even more
the air reeked like a sewer the streets were filthy
a group of ragged children ran between the houses fighting over scraps of bread
deformed beggars crouched next to the entrance gates pleading for money
their cries for help were like a chorus of the ** do not even treat animals like this thought eragon eyes wide with anger
i wo not stay here he said rebelling against the sight
it gets better farther in said brom
right now we need to find an inn and form a strategy
dras leona can be a dangerous place to even the most cautious
i do not want to remain on the streets any longer than necessary
