eragon twirled the falchion in a circle then grimaced
i just wish it did not look so much like a big skinning knife
i feel rather ridiculous with it
ah pay no heed if your enemies laugh
they will not be able to once you lop off their heads
amused eragon nodded
i will take it
one moment then said fredric and disappeared into the pavilion returning with a black leather scabbard decorated with silver scrollwork
he handed the scabbard to eragon and asked did you ever learn how to sharpen a sword shadeslayer you would not have had need with zar roc would you
no eragon admitted but i am a fair hand with a whetstone
i can hone a knife until it is so keen it will cut a thread draped over it
besides i can always true up the edge with magic if i have to
fredric groaned and slapped his thighs knocking loose a dozen or so hairs from his oxhide leggings
no no a razor thin edge is just what you do not want on a sword
the bevel has to be thick thick and strong
a warrior has to be able to maintain his equipment properly and that includes knowing how to sharpen his **
fredric insisted then on procuring a new whetstone for eragon and showing him exactly how to put a battle ready edge on the falchion while they sat in the dirt beside the pavilion
once he was satisfied that eragon could grind an entirely new edge on the sword he said you can fight with rusty armor
you can fight with a dented helmet
but if you want to see the sun rise again never fight with a dull sword
if you ve just survived a battle and you re tired as a man who has climbed one of the beor mountains and your sword is not sharp as it is now it does not matter how you feel you plunk yourself down the first chance you get and pull out your whetstone and strop
just as you would see to your horse or to saphira before you attended to your own needs so too you should care for your sword before yourself
because without it you re no more than helpless prey for your enemies
they had been sitting out in the late afternoon sun for over an hour by the time the weapon master finally finished his instructions
as he did a cool shadow slid over them and saphira landed close by
you waited said eragon
you deliberately ** you could have rescued me ages ago but instead you left me here to listen to fredric go on about water stones oil stones and whether linseed oil is better than rendered fat for protecting metal from water
not really
it is just not as smelly
but that is ** why did you leave me to this doom
one of her thick eyelids drooped in a lazy wink
do not exaggerate
doom you and i have far worse dooms to look forward to if we are not properly prepared
what the man with the smelly clothes was saying seemed important for you to know
well perhaps it was he conceded
she arched her neck and licked the claws on her right foreleg
after thanking fredric and bidding him farewell and agreeing upon a meeting place with blodhgarm eragon fastened the falchion to the belt of beloth the wise and clambered onto saphira is back
he whooped and she roared as she raised her wings and surged up into the sky
giddy eragon clung to the spike in front of him and watched the people and tents below dwindle away into flat miniature versions of themselves
from above the camp was a grid of gray triangular peaks the eastern faces of which were deep in shadow giving the whole region a checkered appearance
the fortifications that encircled the camp bristled like a hedgehog the white tips of the distant poles bright in the slanted sunlight
king orrin is cavalry was a mass of milling dots in the northwestern quadrant of the camp
to the east was the urgals camp low and dark on the rolling plain
the cold pure air stung eragon is cheeks and burned in his lungs
he took only shallow breaths
beside them floated a thick column of clouds looking as solid as whipped cream
saphira spiraled around it her ragged shadow racing across the plume
a lone scrap of moisture struck eragon blinding him for a few seconds and filling his nose and mouth with frigid droplets
he gasped and wiped his face
