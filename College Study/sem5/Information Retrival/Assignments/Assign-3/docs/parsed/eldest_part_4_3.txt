fighting back his dread with every step he began to search for survivors
the site was eerily similar to the battlefield he had inspected earlier except that here the blood was fresh
in the center of the massacre lay ajihad his breastplate rent with numerous gashes surrounded by five urgals he had slain
his breath still came in ragged gasps
eragon knelt by him and lowered his face so his tears would not land on the leader is ruined chest
no one could heal such wounds
running up to them arya paused and stopped her face transformed with sorrow when she saw that ajihad could not be saved
** the name slipped from ajihad is lips no more than a whisper
listen to me eragon
i have one last command for ** eragon leaned closer to catch the dying man is words
you must promise me something promise that you
wo not let the varden fall into chaos
they are the only hope for resisting the empire
they must be kept strong
you must promise me
then peace be with you eragon shadeslayer
with his last breath ajihad closed his eyes setting his noble face in repose and died
eragon bowed his head
he had trouble breathing past the lump in his throat which was so hard it hurt
arya blessed ajihad in a ripple of the ancient language then said in her musical voice alas his death will cause much strife
he is right you must do all you can to avert a struggle for power
i will assist where possible
unwilling to speak eragon gazed at the rest of the bodies
he would have given anything to be elsewhere
saphira nosed one of the urgals and said this should not have happened
it is an evil doing and all the worse for coming when we should be safe and victorious
she examined another body then swung her head ** are the twins and murtagh they re not among the dead
eragon scanned the ** re ** elation surged within him as he hurried to the tunnel is mouth
there pools of thickening blood filled the hollows in the worn marble steps like a series of black mirrors glossy and oval as if several torn bodies had been dragged down ** urgals must have taken ** but why they do not keep prisoners or hostages
despair instantly ** does not matter
we can not pursue them without reinforcements you would not even fit through the opening
they may still be alive
would you abandon them
what do you expect me to do the dwarf tunnels are an endless ** i would only get lost
and i could not catch urgals on foot though arya might be able to
** hesitated torn between his desire for action and his loathing to put her in danger
still if any one person in the varden could handle the urgals it was she
with a groan he explained what they had found
arya is slanted eyebrows met in a frown
it makes no sense
she stared at him for a heavy moment
wiol ** for you
then she bounded forward sword flashing in her hand as she dove into the earth is belly
burning with frustration eragon settled cross legged by ajihad keeping watch over the body
he could barely assimilate the fact that ajihad was dead and murtagh **
son of one of the forsworn the thirteen riders who had helped galbatorix destroy their order and anoint himself king of alagaesia and eragon is friend
at times eragon had wished murtagh gone but now that he had been forcibly removed the loss left an unexpected void
he sat motionless as orik approached with the men
when orik saw ajihad he stamped his feet and swore in dwarvish swinging his ax into the body of an urgal
the men only stood in shock
rubbing a pinch of dirt between his callused hands the dwarf growled ah now a hornet is nest has broken we will have no peace among the varden after ** but this makes things complicated
were you in time to hear his last words
eragon glanced at saphira
they must wait for the right person before i will repeat them
i see
and where d be arya
orik swore again then shook his head and sat on his heels
jormundur soon arrived with twelve ranks of six warriors each
he motioned for them to wait outside the radius of bodies while he proceeded onward alone
he bent and touched ajihad on the shoulder
how can fate be this cruel my old friend i would have been here sooner if not for the size of this cursed mountain and then you might have been saved
