still gazing at the swallows oromis said not even your mother could anticipate where morzan would send her next nor when she could return to his castle
therefore brom had to remain on morzan is estate for extended lengths of time if he wished to see her
for nigh on three years brom served as one of morzan is gardeners
now and then he would slip away to send a message to the varden or to communicate with his spies throughout the empire but other than that he did not leave the castle grounds
three ** was not he afraid that morzan might see him and recognize him
oromis lowered his gaze from the heavens returning it to eragon
brom was most adept at disguising himself and it had been many years since he and morzan had last stood face to face
** eragon twisted his goblet between his fingers studying how the light refracted through the crystal
then what happened
then said oromis one of brom is agents in teirm made contact with a young scholar by the name of jeod who wished to join the varden and who claimed to have discovered evidence of a hitherto secret tunnel that led into the elf built portion of the castle in uru baen
brom rightly felt that jeod is discovery was too important to ignore so he packed his bags made his excuses to his fellow servants and then departed for teirm with all possible haste
she had left a month before on another of morzan is missions
struggling to weld a cohesive whole out of the fragmented accounts he had heard from various people eragon said so then
brom met with jeod and once he was convinced the tunnel was real he arranged for one of the varden to attempt to steal the three dragon eggs galbatorix was holding in uru baen
oromis is face darkened
unfortunately for reasons that have never become entirely clear the man they selected for the task a certain hefring of furnost succeeded in filching only one egg saphira is from galbatorix is treasury and once he had possession of it he fled from both the varden and galbatorix is servants
because of his betrayal brom had to spend the next seven months chasing hefring back and forth across the land in a desperate attempt to recapture saphira
and during that time my mother traveled in secret to carvahall where she gave birth to me five months later
oromis nodded
you were conceived just before your mother set forth upon her last mission
as a result brom knew nothing of her condition while he was pursuing hefring and saphira is egg
when brom and morzan finally confronted each other in gil ead morzan asked brom whether he had been responsible for the disappearance of his black hand
it is understandable that morzan would suspect brom is involvement since brom had arranged the deaths of several of the forsworn
brom of course immediately concluded that something terrible had befallen your mother
he later told me it was that belief which gave him the strength and fortitude he needed to kill morzan and his dragon
once they were dead brom took saphira is egg from morzan is corpse for morzan had already located hefring and seized the egg from him and then brom left the city pausing only long enough to hide saphira where he knew the varden would eventually find her
so that is why jeod thought brom died in gil ead said eragon
again oromis nodded
stricken by fear brom dared not wait for his companions
even if your mother was alive and well brom worried that galbatorix would decide to make selena his own black hand and that she would never again have the chance to escape her service to the empire
eragon felt tears wet his eyes
how brom must have loved her to leave everyone behind as soon as he knew she was in danger
from gil ead brom rode straight to morzan is estate stopping only to sleep
for all his speed however he was still too slow
when he reached the castle he discovered that your mother had returned a fortnight prior sick and weary from her mysterious journey
morzan is healers tried to save her but in spite of their efforts she had passed into the void just hours before brom arrived at the castle
he never saw her again eragon asked his throat tightening
