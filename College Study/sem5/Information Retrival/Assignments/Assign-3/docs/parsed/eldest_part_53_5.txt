i ope you can sail her yourself longshanks cause not one of us knows how to handle anything larger than a barge
a few men from the crews of my ships are still in teirm
they re in the same position i am unable to fight or flee
i am confident they will jump at a chance to get to surda
they can teach you what to do on thedragon wing
it wo not be easy but i do not see much choice in the matter
roran grinned
the plan was to his liking swift decisive and unexpected
you mentioned said birgit that in the past year none of your ships nor those from other merchants who serve the varden have reached their destination
why then should this mission succeed when so many have failed
jeod was quick to answer because surprise is on our side
the law requires merchant ships to submit their itinerary for approval with the port authority at least two weeks before departure
it takes a great deal of time to prepare a ship for launch so if we leave without warning it could be a week or more before galbatorix can launch intercept vessels
if luck is with us we wo not see so much as the topmast of our pursuers
so continued jeod if you are willing to attempt this enterprise this is what we must do
