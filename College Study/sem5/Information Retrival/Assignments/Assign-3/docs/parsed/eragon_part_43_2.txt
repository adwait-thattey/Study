orik pointed at tronjheim is white pinnacle
fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there he told saphira
you may stay in any of the caves
once you make your choice bedding will be laid down in it and then no one will disturb you
i thought we were going to go together
i do not want to be separated protested eragon
orik turned to him
rider eragon i will do everything to accommodate you but it would be best if saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat
the tunnels to the banquet halls are not large enough for her to accompany us
why can not you just bring me food in the hold
because said orik with a guarded expression the food is prepared down here and it is a long way to the top
if you wish a servant could be sent up to the hold with a meal for you
it will take some time but you could eat with saphira then
he actually means it eragon thought astonished that they would do so much for him
but the way orik said it made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow
i am weary said ** this dragonhold sounds to my liking
go have your meal then come to me
it will be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers
we have suffered the hardships of the trail too long
eragon looked at her thoughtfully then said to orik i will eat down ** the dwarf smiled seeming satisfied
eragon unstrapped saphira is saddle so she could lie down without ** you take zar roc with you
yes she said gathering up the sword and saddle with her ** keep your bow
we must trust these people though not to the point of foolishness
with an explosive leap saphira swept off the ground and into the still air
the steady whoosh of her wings was the only sound in the darkness
as she disappeared over the rim of tronjheim is peak orik let out a long breath
ah boy you have been blessed indeed
i find a sudden longing in my heart for open skies and soaring cliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk
still my feet are better on the ground preferably under it
he clapped his hands loudly
i neglect my duties as host
i know you ve not dined since that pitiful dinner the twins saw fit to give you so come let is find the cooks and beg meat and bread from **
eragon followed the dwarf back into tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they came to a long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for dwarves
fires blazed in soapstone ovens behind a long counter
orik spoke words in an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddy faced dwarf who promptly handed them stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish
then orik took eragon up several flights of stairs and into a small alcove carved out of tronjheim is outer wall where they sat cross legged
eragon wordlessly reached for his food
when their platters were empty orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a long stemmed pipe
he lit it saying a worthy repast though it needed a good draught of mead to wash it down properly
eragon surveyed the ground below
do you farm in farthen dur
no there is only enough sunlight for moss mushrooms and mold
tronjheim cannot survive without supplies from the surrounding valleys which is one reason why many of us choose to live elsewhere in the beor mountains
then there are other dwarf cities
not as many as we would like
and tronjheim is the greatest of ** leaning on an elbow orik took a deep pull on his pipe
you have only seen the lower levels so it has not been apparent but most of tronjheim is deserted
the farther up you go the emptier it gets
entire floors have remained untouched for centuries
most dwarves prefer to dwell under tronjheim and farthen dur in the caverns and passageways that riddle the rock
through the centuries we have tunneled extensively under the beor mountains
it is possible to walk from one end of the mountain range to the other without ever setting foot on the surface
it seems like a waste to have all that unused space in tronjheim commented eragon
orik nodded
some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our resources but tronjheim does perform one invaluable task
