they appeared as alarmed as she felt
arya said saphira would not be so calm if eragon was hurt or dead
where is he then demanded nasuada
what trouble has he gotten himself into now
a raucous commotion filled the clearing as jormundur and his men directed the onlookers back to their tents laying about them with swagger sticks whenever the reluctant warriors lingered or protested
several scuffles broke out but the captains under jormundur quickly overwhelmed the culprits so as to prevent the violence from taking root and spreading
fortunately the urgals at the word of their war chief garzhvog left without incident although garzhvog himself advanced toward nasuada as did king orrin and the dwarf narheim
nasuada felt the ground tremble under her feet as the eight and a half foot tall urgal approached her
he lifted his bony chin baring his throat as was the custom of his race and said what means this lady nightstalker the shape of his jaws and teeth coupled with his accent made it difficult for nasuada to understand him
yes i d bloody well like an explanation myself said orrin
his face was red
it occurred to nasuada as she regarded them that this was probably the first time in thousands of years that members of so many of the races of alagaesia had gathered together in peace
the only ones missing were the ra zac and their mounts and nasuada knew no sane being would ever invite those foul creatures into their secret councils
she pointed at saphira and said she shall provide the answers you desire
just as the last stragglers quit the clearing a torrent of air rushed across nasuada as saphira swooped to the ground raking her wings to slow herself before alighting upon her rear legs
she dropped to all fours and a dull boom resounded across the camp
un buckling themselves from her saddle roran and katrina quickly dismounted
striding forward nasuada examined katrina
she was curious to see what kind of woman could inspire a man to undertake such extraordinary feats in order to rescue her
the young woman before her was strong boned with the pallid complexion of an invalid a mane of copper hair and a dress so torn and filthy it was impossible to determine what it might have looked like originally
in spite of the toll her captivity had taken it was apparent to nasuada that katrina was attractive enough but not what the bards would call a great beauty
however she possessed a certain force of gaze and bearing that made nasuada think that if roran had been the one captured katrina would have been just as capable of rousing the villagers of carvahall getting them south to surda fighting in the battle of the burning plains and then continuing on to helgrind all for the sake of her beloved
even when she noticed garzhvog katrina did not flinch or quail but remained standing where she was next to roran
roran bowed to nasuada and swiveling also to king orrin
my lady he said his face grave
your majesty
if i may this is my betrothed ** she curtsied to them both
welcome to the varden katrina said nasuada
we have all heard your name here on account of roran is uncommon devotion
songs of his love for you already spread across the land
you are most welcome added orrin
most welcome indeed
nasuada noticed that the king had eyes only for katrina as did every man present including the dwarves and nasuada was certain they would be recounting tales of katrina is charms to their comrades in arms before the night was out
what roran had done on her behalf elevated her far above ordinary women it made her an object of mystery fascination and allure to the warriors
that anyone should sacrifice so much for another person meant by reason of the price paid that person must be unusually precious
katrina blushed and smiled
thank you she said
along with her embarrassment at such attentions a hint of pride colored her expression as if she knew how remarkable roran was and delighted in having captured his heart of all the women in alagaesia
he was hers and that was all the status or treasure she desired
a pang of loneliness shot through nasuada
