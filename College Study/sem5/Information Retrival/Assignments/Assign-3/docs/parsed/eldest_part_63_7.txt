the very nature of his search looking for malevolent intent perhaps hidden somewhere in garzhvog is past meant eragon had to examine years of memories
unlike the twins eragon avoided causing deliberate pain but he was not overly gentle
he could feel garzhvog flinch with occasional pangs of discomfort
like dwarves and elves the mind of an urgal possessed different elements than a human mind
its structure emphasized rigidity and hierarchy a result of the tribes the urgals organized themselves into but it felt rough and raw brutal and cunning the mind of a wild animal
though he made no effort to learn more about garzhvog as an individual eragon could not help absorbing pieces of the urgal is life
garzhvog did not resist
indeed he seemed eager to share his experiences to convince eragon that urgals were not his born ** cannot afford to have another rider rise up who seeks to destroy us said ** well o firesword and see if we are truly the monsters you call us
so many images and sensations flashed between them eragon almost lost track garzhvog is childhood with the other members of his brood in a ramshackle village built deep in the heart of the spine his dam brushing his hair with an antler comb and singing a soft song learning to hunt deer and other prey with his bare hands growing larger and larger until it was apparent that the old blood still flowed in his veins and he would stand over eight feet tall making him a kull the dozens of challenges he made accepted and won venturing out of the village to gain renown so he might mate and gradually learning to hate distrust and fear yes fear a world that had condemned his race fighting in farthen dur discovering they had been manipulated by durza and realizing that their only hope of a better life was to put aside old differences befriend the varden and see galbatorix overthrown
nowhere was there evidence that garzhvog lied
eragon could not understand what he had seen
tearing himself from garzhvog is mind he dove into each of the three remaining urgals
their memories confirmed the facts presented by garzhvog
they made no attempt to conceal that they had killed humans but it had been done at the command of durza when the sorcerer controlled them or when fighting humans over food or ** did what we had to in order to care for our families they said
when he finished eragon stood before garzhvog and knew the urgal is bloodline was as regal as any prince is
he knew that though uneducated garzhvog was a brilliant commander and as great a thinker and philosopher as oromis ** is certainly brighter than me admitted eragon to saphira
baring his throat as a sign of respect he said out loud nar garzhvog and for the first time he was aware of the lofty origins of the titlenar
i am proud to have you at my side
you may tell the herndall that so long as the urgals remain true to their word and do not turn against the varden i shall not oppose ** eragon doubted that he would everlike an urgal but the iron certitude of his prejudice only a few minutes before now seemed ignorant and he could not retain it in good conscience
saphira flicked him on the arm with her barbed tongue making the mail clink ** takes courage to admit you were wrong
only if you are afraid of looking foolish and i would have looked far more foolish if i persisted with an erroneous belief
why little one you just said something ** her teasing he could sense her warm pride in what he had accomplished
again we are in your debt firesword said garzhvog
he and the other urgals pressed their fists against their jutting brows
eragon could tell that nasuada wanted to know the details of what had just transpired but that she restrained herself
good
now that this is settled i must be off
eragon you will receive my signal from trianna when the time has ** with that she strode away into the darkness
as eragon settled against saphira orik sidled up to him
it is lucky we dwarves are going to be here eh we will watch the kull like hawks we will
we wo not let them catch you while your back is turned
