arya said he is gilderien the wise prince of house miolandra wielder of the white flame of vandil and guardian of ellesmera since the days of du fyrn skulblaka our war with the dragons
none may enter the city unless he permits it
a quarter of a mile beyond the forest thinned and breaks appeared within the canopy allowing planks of mottled sunlight to bar the way
then they passed underneath two burled trees that leaned against each other and stopped at the edge of an empty glade
the ground was strewn with dense patches of flowers
from pink roses to bluebells and lilies spring is fleeting treasure was heaped about like piles of rubies sapphires and opals
their intoxicating aromas attracted hordes of bumblebees
to the right a stream chuckled behind a row of bushes while a pair of squirrels chased each other around a rock
at first it looked to eragon like a place where deer might bed for the night
but as he continued to stare he began to pick out paths hidden among the brush and trees soft warm light where normally there would be auburn shadows an odd pattern in the shapes of the twigs and branches and flowers so subtle that it nearly escaped detection clues that what he saw was not entirely natural
he blinked and his vision suddenly shifted as if a lens had been placed over his eyes resolving everything into recognizable shapes
those were paths aye
and those were flowers aye
but what he had taken to be clusters of lumpy twisted trees were in fact graceful buildings that grew directly out of the pines
one tree bulged at the base to form a two story house before sinking its roots into the loam
both stories were hexagonal although the upper level was half as small as the first which gave the house a tiered appearance
the roofs and walls were made of webbed sheets of wood draped over six thick ridges
moss and yellow lichen bearded the eaves and hung over jeweled windows set into each side
the front door was a mysterious black silhouette recessed under an archway wrought with symbols
another house was nestled between three pines which were joined to it through a series of curved branches
reinforced by those flying buttresses the house rose five levels light and airy
beside it sat a bower woven out of willow and dogwood and hung with flameless lanterns disguised as galls
each unique building enhanced and complemented its surroundings blending seamlessly with the rest of the forest until it was impossible to tell where artifice ended and nature resumed
the two were in perfect balance
instead of mastering their environment the elves had chosen to accept the world as it was and adapt themselves to it
the inhabitants of ellesmera eventually revealed themselves as a flicker of movement at the fringe of eragon is sight no more than needles stirring in the breeze
then he caught glimpses of hands a pale face a sandaled foot an upraised arm
one by one the wary elves stepped into view their almond eyes fixed upon saphira arya and eragon
the women wore their hair unbound
it rippled down their backs in waves of silver and sable braided with fresh blossoms like a garden waterfall
they all possessed a delicate ethereal beauty that belied their unbreakable strength to eragon they seemed flawless
the men were just as striking with high cheekbones finely sculpted noses and heavy eyelids
both sexes were garbed in rustic tunics of green and brown fringed with dusky colors of orange russet and gold
the fair folk indeed thought eragon
he touched his lips in greeting
as one the elves bowed from the waist
then they smiled and laughed with unrestrained happiness
from within their midst a woman sang
eom kona dauthleikr
eragon clapped his hands over his ears fearing that the melody was a spell like the one he had heard at silthrim but arya shook her head and lifted his hands
it is not ** then she spoke to her horse saying ** the stallion nickered and trotted away
release your steeds as well
we have no further need of them and they deserve to rest in our stables
the song waxed stronger as arya proceeded along a cobblestone path set with bits of green tourmaline which looped among the hollyhocks and the houses and the trees before finally crossing a stream
