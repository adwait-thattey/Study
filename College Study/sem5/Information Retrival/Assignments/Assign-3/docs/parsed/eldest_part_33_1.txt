awall of thick smoky air engulfed roran as he entered the seven sheaves morn is tavern
he stopped beneath the urgal horns pegged over the door and let his eyes adjust to the dim interior
hello he called
the door to the back rooms banged open as tara plowed forward trailed by morn
they both glared sullenly at roran
tara planted her meaty fists on her hips and demanded what do you want here
roran stared at her for a moment trying to determine the source of her animosity
have you decided whether to accompany me into the spine
that is none of your business snapped tara
oh yes it ** restrained himself though and instead said whatever your intentions are if youwere to go elain would like to know if you have room in your bags for a few more items or if you need extra room yourself
she has
extra ** burst out morn
he waved at the wall behind the bar which was lined with oak casks
i have packed in straw twelve barrels of the clearest winter ale which have been kept at the perfect temperature for the past five months
they were quimby is last ** what am i supposed to do with them or my hogsheads of lager and stout if i leave them the soldiers will dispose of it in a week or they will spike the barrels and pour the beer into the ground where the only creatures who will enjoy it will be grubs and worms
** morn sat and wrung his hands shaking his head
twelve years of ** ever since father died i ran the tavern the same way he did day in and day out
and then you and eragon had to cause this trouble
it
he stopped breathing with difficulty and wiped his mashed face with the edge of his sleeve
there there now said tara
she put her arm around morn and jabbed a finger at roran
who gave you leave to stir up carvahall with your fancy words if we go how will my poor husband make a living he can not take his trade with him like horst or gedric
he can not squat in an empty field and farm it like ** ** everyone will go and we will starve
or we will go and we willstill starve
you have ruined **
roran looked from her flushed angry face to morn is distraught one then turned and opened the door
he paused on the threshold and said in a low voice i have always counted you among my friends
i would not have you killed by the ** stepping outside he pulled his vest tight around himself and paced away from the tavern ruminating the whole way
at fisk is well he stopped for a drink and found himself joined by birgit
she watched him struggle to turn the crank with only one hand then took it from him and brought up the water bucket which she passed to him without drinking
he sipped the cool liquid then said i am glad that you are ** he handed the bucket back
birgit eyed him
i recognize the force that drives you roran for it propels me as well we both wish to find the ra zac
once we do though i will have my compensation from you for quimby is death
never forget ** she pushed the full bucket back into the well and let it fall unchecked the crank spinning wildly
a second later the well echoed with a hollow splash
roran smiled as he watched her walk away
he was more pleased than upset by her declaration he knew that even if everyone else in carvahall were to forsake the cause or die birgit would still help him to hunt the ra zac
afterward though if an afterward existed he would have to pay her price or kill her
that was the only way to resolve such matters
by evening horst and his sons had returned to the house bearing two small bundles wrapped in oilcloth
is that all asked elain
horst nodded curtly lay the bundles on the kitchen table and unwrapped them to expose four hammers three tongs a clamp a medium sized bellows and a three pound anvil
as the five of them sat to dinner albriech and baldor discussed the various people they had seen making covert preparations
roran listened intently trying to keep track of who had lent donkeys to whom who showed no signs of departing and who might need help to leave
the biggest problem said baldor is food
we can only carry so much and it will be difficult to hunt enough in the spine to feed two or three hundred people
