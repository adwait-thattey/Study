fly well ** the elves sang out as saphira launched herself off the embankment
as saphira winged her way toward thorn eragon joined his mind first with her and then with arya and through arya with blodhgarm and the eleven other elves
by having arya serve as the focal point for the elves eragon was able to concentrate on the thoughts of arya and saphira he knew them so well that their reactions would not distract him in the middle of a fight
eragon grasped the shield with his left hand and unsheathed his falchion holding it upraised so he would not accidentally stab saphira is wings as she flapped nor slash her shoulders nor her neck which were in constant motion
i am glad i took the time last night to reinforce the falchion with magic he said to saphira and arya
let us hope your spells hold saphira answered
remember said arya remain as close to us as you can
the more distance you place between us the harder it is for us to maintain this bond with you
thorn did not dive at saphira or otherwise attack her as she neared him but rather slid away on rigid wings allowing her to rise to his level unmolested
the two dragons balanced upon the thermals facing each other across a gap of fifty yards the tips of their barbed tails twitching both of their muzzles wrinkled with ferocious snarls
he is bigger observed saphira
it is not been two weeks since we last fought and he has grown another four feet if not more
she was right
thorn was longer from head to tail and deeper in the chest than he had been when they first clashed over the burning plains
he was barely older than a hatchling but he was already nearly as large as saphira
eragon reluctantly shifted his gaze from the dragon to the rider
murtagh was bareheaded and his long black hair billowed behind him like a sleek mane
his face was hard harder than eragon had ever seen before and eragon knew that this time murtagh would not could not show him mercy
the volume of his voice substantially reduced but still louder than normal murtagh said you and saphira have caused us a great deal of pain eragon
galbatorix was furious with us for letting you go
and after the two of you killed the ra zac he was so angry he slew five of his servants and then turned his wrath upon thorn and me
we have both suffered horribly on account of you
we shall not do so ** he drew back his arm as if thorn were about to lunge forward and murtagh were preparing to slash at eragon and saphira
** cried eragon
i know of a way you can both free yourselves of your oaths to galbatorix
an expression of desperate longing transformed murtagh is features and he lowered zar roc a few inches
then he scowled and spat toward the ground and shouted i do not believe ** it is not **
it ** just let me explain
murtagh seemed to be struggling with himself and for a while eragon thought he might refuse
swinging his head around thorn looked back at murtagh and something passed between them
blast you eragon said murtagh and lay zar roc across the front of his saddle
blast you for baiting us with this
we had already made peace with our lot and you have to tantalize us with the specter of a hope we had abandoned
if this proves to be a false hope brother i swear i will cut off your right hand before we present you to galbatorix
you wo not need it for what you will be doing in uru baen
a threat of his own occurred to eragon but he suppressed it
lowering the falchion he said galbatorix would not have told you but when i was among the elves
eragon do not reveal anything more about ** exclaimed arya
i learned that if your personality changes so does your true name in the ancient language
who you are is not cast in iron ** if you and thorn can change something about yourselves your oaths will no longer bind you and galbatorix will lose his hold on you
thorn drifted several yards closer to saphira
why did not you mention this before murtagh demanded
i was too confused at the time
a scant fifty feet separated thorn and saphira by then
the red dragon is snarl had subsided to a faint warning curl of his upper lip and in his sparkling crimson eyes appeared a vast puzzled sadness as if he hoped saphira or eragon might know why he had been brought into the world merely so galbatorix could enslave him abuse him and force him to destroy other beings lives
