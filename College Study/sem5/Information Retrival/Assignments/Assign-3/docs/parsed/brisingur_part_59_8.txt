varaug rose onto one knee then faltered as eragon redoubled his efforts
arya lunged forward her dark hair flying
and she stabbed the shade through his heart
eragon winced and extricated himself from varaug is mind even as the shade recoiled from arya pulling himself off her blade
the shade opened his mouth and uttered a piercing dithering wail that shattered the panes of glass in the lantern above
he reached out toward arya and tottered in her direction then stopped as his skin faded and became transparent revealing the dozens of glittering spirits trapped within the confines of his flesh
the spirits throbbed growing in size and varaug is skin split along the bellies of his muscles
with a final burst of light the spirits tore varaug apart and fled the tower room passing through the walls as if the stone were insubstantial
eragon is pulse gradually slowed
then feeling very old and very tired he walked over to arya who stood leaning against a chair cupping the front of her neck with a hand
she coughed spitting up blood
since she seemed incapable of talking eragon placed his hand over hers and said waise ** as the energy to mend her injuries flowed out of him eragon is legs weakened and he had to brace himself against the chair
better he asked as the spell finished its work
better arya whispered and favored him with a weak smile
she motioned toward where varaug had been
we killed him
we killed him and yet we did not ** she sounded surprised
so few have ever killed a shade and lived
that is because they fought alone not together like us
i had you to help me in farthen dur and you had me to help you here
now i shall have to call you shadeslayer
saphira startled them by loosing a long mournful keen
still keening she raked her claws across the floor chipping and scratching the stones
her tail whipped from side to side smashing the furniture and the grim paintings on the walls
** she said
** gone forever
saphira what is wrong exclaimed arya
when saphira did not answer arya repeated the question to eragon
hating the words he spoke eragon said oromis and glaedr are dead
galbatorix killed them
arya staggered as if she had been hit
ah she said
she gripped the back of the chair so hard her knuckles turned white
tears filled her slanted eyes then spilled over onto her cheeks and coursed down her face
** she reached out and grasped his shoulder and almost by accident he found himself holding her in his arms
eragon felt his own eyes grow wet
he clenched his jaw in an effort to maintain his composure if he started crying he knew he would not be able to stop
he and arya remained locked together for a long while consoling each other then arya withdrew and said how did it happen
oromis had one of his seizures and while he was paralyzed galbatorix used murtagh to eragon is voice broke and he shook his head
i will tell you about it along with nasuada
she should know about this and i do not want to have to describe it more than once
arya nodded
then let us go and see her
