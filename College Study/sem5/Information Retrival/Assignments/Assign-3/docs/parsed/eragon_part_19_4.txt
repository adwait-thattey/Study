we need two horses and a full set of tack for both
the horses have to be fast and tough we will be doing a lot of traveling
haberth was thoughtful for a moment
i do not have many animals like that and the ones i do are not ** the stallion moved restlessly he calmed it with a few strokes of his fingers
price is no object
i will take the best you have said brom
haberth nodded and silently tied the stallion to a stall
he went to the wall and started pulling down saddles and other items
soon he had two identical piles
next he walked up the line of stalls and brought out two horses
one was a light bay the other a roan
the bay tugged against his rope
he is a little spirited but with a firm hand you wo not have any problems said haberth handing the bay is rope to brom
brom let the horse smell his hand it allowed him to rub its neck
we will take him he said then eyed the roan
the other one however i am not so sure of
there are some good legs on him
mmm
what will you take for snowfire
haberth looked fondly at the stallion
i d rather not sell him
he is the finest i ve ever bred i am hoping to sire a whole line from him
if you were willing to part with him how much would all of this cost me asked brom
eragon tried to put his hand on the bay like brom had but it shied away
he automatically reached out with his mind to reassure the horse stiffening with surprise as he touched the animal is consciousness
the contact was not clear or sharp like it was with saphira but he could communicate with the bay to a limited degree
tentatively he made it understand that he was a friend
the horse calmed and looked at him with liquid brown eyes
haberth used his fingers to add up the price of the purchase
two hundred crowns and no less he said with a smile clearly confident that no one would pay that much
brom silently opened his pouch and counted out the money
there was a long silence as haberth glanced between snowfire and the coins
a sigh then he is yours though i go against my heart
i will treat him as if he had been sired by gildintor the greatest steed of legend said brom
your words gladden me answered haberth bowing his head slightly
he helped them saddle the horses
when they were ready to leave he said farewell then
for the sake of snowfire i hope that misfortune does not befall you
do not fear i will guard him well promised brom as they departed
here he said handing snowfire is reins to eragon go to the far side of therinsford and wait there
why asked eragon but brom had already slipped away
annoyed he exited therinsford with the two horses and stationed himself beside the road
to the south he saw the hazy outline of utgard sitting like a giant monolith at the end of the valley
its peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight towering over the lesser mountains that surrounded it
its dark ominous look made eragon is scalp tingle
brom returned shortly and gestured for eragon to follow
they walked until therinsford was hidden by trees
then brom said the ra zac definitely passed this way
apparently they stopped here to pick up horses as we did
i was able to find a man who saw them
he described them with many shudders and said that they galloped out of therinsford like demons fleeing a holy man
eragon patted the horses
when we were in the barn i touched the bay is mind by accident
i did not know it was possible to do that
brom frowned
it is unusual for one as young as you to have the ability
most riders had to train for years before they were strong enough to contact anything other than their ** his face was thoughtful as he inspected snowfire
then he said take everything from your pack put it into the saddlebags and tie the pack on ** eragon did so while brom mounted snowfire
eragon gazed doubtfully at the bay
it was so much smaller than saphira that for an absurd moment he wondered if it could bear his weight
with a sigh he awkwardly got into the saddle
he had only ridden horses bareback and never for any distance
is this going to do the same thing to my legs as riding saphira he asked
not too bad but i think any hard riding will open them up again
