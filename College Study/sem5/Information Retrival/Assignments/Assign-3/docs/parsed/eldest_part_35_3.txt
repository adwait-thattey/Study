how came you to possess morzan is sword
it was given to me by brom
brom she hefted zar roc
brom
i remember brom
he begged me to replace the sword he had lost
truly i wished to help him but i had already taken my oath
my refusal angered him beyond reason
oromis had to knock him unconscious before he would leave
eragon seized on the information with interest
your handiwork has served me well rhunon elda
i would be long dead were it not for zar roc
i killed the shade durza with it
did you now then some good has come of ** sheathing zar roc rhunon returned it to him though not without reluctance then looked past him to saphira
ah
well met skulblaka
without bothering to ask permission rhunon went up to saphira is shoulder and tapped a scale with one of her blunt fingernails twisting her head from side to side in an attempt to peer into the translucent pebble
good color
not like those brown dragons all muddy and dark
properly speaking a rider is sword should match the hue of his dragon and this blue would have made a gorgeous blade
the thought seemed to drain the energy from her
she returned to the anvil and stared at the wrecked tongs as if the will to replace them had deserted her
eragon felt that it would be wrong to end the conversation on such a depressing note but he could not think of a tactful way to change the subject
the glimmering corselet caught his attention and as he studied it he was astonished to see that every ring was welded shut
because the tiny links cooled so quickly they usually had to be welded before being attached to the main piece of mail which meant that the finest mail such as eragon is hauberk was composed of links that were alternately welded and riveted closed
unless it seemed the smith possessed an elf is speed and precision
eragon said i ve never seen the equal of your mail not even among the dwarves
how do you have the patience to weld every link why do not you just use magic and save yourself the work
he hardly expected the burst of passion that animated rhunon
she tossed her short cropped hair and said and rob myself of all pleasure in this task aye every other elf and i could use magic to satisfy our desires and some do but then what meaning is there in life how would you fill your time tell me
by pursuing that which you love the most
when you can have anything you want by uttering a few words the goal matters not only the journey to it
a lesson for you
you will face the same dilemma one day if you live long enough
now ** i am weary of this ** with that rhunon plucked the lid off the forge retrieved a new pair of tongs and immersed a ring in the coals while she worked the bellows with single minded intensity
rhunon elda said arya remember i will return for you on the eve of the agaeti ** a grunt was her only reply
the rhythmic peal of steel on steel as lonely as the cry of a death bird in the night accompanied them back through the dogwood tunnel and onto the path
behind them rhunon was no more than a black figure bowed over the sullen glow of her forge
she made all the riders swords asked eragon
every last one
that and more
she is the greatest smith who has ever lived
i thought that you should meet her for her sake and yours
is she always so brusque asked saphira
arya laughed
always
for her nothing matters except her craft and she is famously impatient with anything or anyone that interferes with it
her eccentricities are well tolerated though because of her incredible skill and accomplishments
while she spoke eragon tried to work out the meaning ofagaeti blodhren
he was fairly sure thatblodh stood forblood and as a result thatblodhren wasblood oath but he had never heard ofagaeti
celebration explained arya when he asked
we hold the blood oath celebration once every century to honor our pact with the dragons
both of you are fortunate to be here now for it is nigh upon us
her slanted eyebrows met as she frowned
fate has indeed arranged a most auspicious coincidence
she surprised eragon by leading them deeper into du weldenvarden down paths tangled with nettles and currant bushes until the lights around them vanished and they entered the restless wilderness
