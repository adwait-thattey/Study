if roran had known how to read he might have been more impressed by the treasure trove of books that lined the study walls
as it was he reserved his attention for the tall man with graying hair who stood behind an oval writing desk
the man who roran assumed was jeod looked about as tired as roran felt
his face was lined careworn and sad and when he turned toward them a nasty scar gleamed white from his scalp to his left temple
to roran it bespoke steel in the man
long and buried perhaps but steel nevertheless
do sit said jeod
i wo not stand on ceremony in my own ** he watched them with curious eyes as they settled in the soft leather armchairs
may i offer you pastries and a glass of apricot brandy i cannot talk for long but i see you ve been on the road for many a week and i well remember how dusty my throat was after such journeys
loring grinned
aye
a touch of brandy would be welcome indeed
you re most generous sir
only a glass of milk for my boy said birgit
of course ** jeod rang for the butler delivered his instructions then leaned back in his chair
i am at a disadvantage
i believe you have my name but i do not have yours
stronghammer at your service said roran
mardra at your service said birgit
kell at your service said nolfavrell
and i d be wally at your service finished loring
and i at yours responded jeod
now rolf mentioned that you wished to do business with me
it is only fair that you know i am in no position to buy or sell goods nor have i gold for investing nor proud ships to carry wool and food gems and spices across the restless sea
what then can i do for you
roran rested his elbows on his knees then knitted his fingers together and stared between them as he marshaled his ** slip of the tongue could kill us here he reminded himself
to put it simply sir we represent a certain group of people who for various reasons must purchase a large amount of supplies with very little money
we know that your belongings will be auctioned off day after tomorrow to repay your debts and we would like to offer a bid now on those items we need
we would have waited until the auction but circumstances press us and we cannot tarry another two days
if we are to strike a bargain it must be tonight or tomorrow no later
what manner of supplies do you need asked jeod
food and whatever else is required to outfit a ship or other vessel for a long voyage at sea
a spark of interest gleamed in jeod is weary face
do you have a certain ship in mind for i know every craft that is plied these waters in the last twenty years
jeod accepted that without question
i understand now why you thought to come to me but i fear you labor under a ** he spread his gray hands indicating the room
everything you see here no longer belongs to me but to my creditors
i have no authority to sell my possessions and if i did so without permission i would likely be imprisoned for cheating my creditors out of the money i owe them
he paused as rolf backed into the study carrying a large silver tray dotted with pastries cut crystal goblets a glass of milk and a decanter of brandy
the butler placed the tray on a padded footstool and then proceeded to serve the refreshments
roran took his goblet and sipped the mellow brandy wondering how soon courtesy would allow the four of them to excuse themselves and resume their quest
when rolf left the room jeod drained his goblet with a single draught then said i may be of no use to you but i do know a number of people in my profession who might
might
be able to help
if you can give me a bit more detail about what you want to buy then i d have a better idea of who to recommend
roran saw no harm in that so he began to recite a list of items the villagershad to have things they might need and things they wanted but would never be able to afford unless fortune smiled greatly upon them
now and then birgit or loring mentioned something roran had forgotten like lamp oil and jeod would glance at them for a moment before returning his hooded gaze to roran where it remained with growing intensity
