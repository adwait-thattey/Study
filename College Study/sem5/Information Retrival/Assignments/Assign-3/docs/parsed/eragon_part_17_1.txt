it was dark when eragon jolted upright in bed breathing hard
the room was chilly goose bumps formed on his arms and shoulders
it was a few hours before dawn the time when nothing moves and life waits for the first warm touches of sunlight
his heart pounded as a terrible premonition gripped him
it felt like a shroud lay over the world and its darkest corner was over his room
he quietly got out of bed and dressed
with apprehension he hurried down the hallway
alarm shot through him when he saw the door to garrow is room open and people clustered inside
garrow lay peacefully on the bed
he was dressed in clean clothes his hair had been combed back and his face was calm
he might have been sleeping if not for the silver amulet clasped around his neck and the sprig of dried hemlock on his chest the last gifts from the living to the dead
katrina stood next to the bed face pale and eyes downcast
he heard her whisper i had hoped to call himfather one day
call him father he thought bitterly a right even i do not have
he felt like a ghost drained of all vitality
everything was insubstantial except for garrow is face
tears flooded eragon is cheeks
he stood there shoulders shaking but did not cry out
mother aunt uncle he had lost them all
the weight of his grief was crushing a monstrous force that left him tottering
someone led him back to his room uttering consolations
he fell on the bed wrapped his arms around his head and sobbed convulsively
he felt saphira contact him but he pushed her aside and let himself be swept away by sorrow
he could not accept that garrow was gone
if he did what was left to believe in only a merciless uncaring world that snuffed lives like candles before a wind
frustrated and terrified he turned his tear dampened face toward the heavens and shouted what god would do this show ** he heard people running to his room but no answer came from above
he did not deserve **
comforting hands touched him and he was aware of elain sitting next to him
she held him as he cried and eventually exhausted he slipped unwillingly into sleep
anguish enveloped eragon as he awoke
though he kept his eyes closed they could not stop a fresh flow of tears
he searched for some idea or hope to help him keep his ** can not live with this he moaned
then do ** is words reverberated in his head
how garrow is gone ** and in time i must meet the same fate
love family accomplishments they are all torn away leaving nothing
what is the worth of anything we do
the worth is in the act
your worth halts when you surrender the will to change and experience life
but options are before you choose one and dedicate yourself to it
the deeds will give you new hope and purpose
the only true guide is your heart
nothing less than its supreme desire can help you
she left him to ponder her statements
eragon examined his emotions
it surprised him that more than grief he found a searing ** do you want me to do
pursue the strangers
her frank answer confused him
he took a deep trembling **
remember what you said in the spine how you reminded me of my duty as dragon and i returned with you despite the urging of my instinct so too must you control yourself
i thought long and deep the past few days and i realized what it means to be dragon and rider it is our destiny to attempt the impossible to accomplish great deeds regardless of fear
it is our responsibility to the future
i do not care what you say those are not reasons to ** eragon
then here are others
my tracks have been seen and people are alert to my presence
eventually i will be exposed
besides there is nothing here for you
no farm no family and
but if you stay you will have to explain what really happened
he has a right to know how and why his father died
what might he do once he knows of me
saphira is arguments whirled around in eragon is head but he shrank from the idea of forsaking palancar valley it was his home
yet the thought of enacting vengeance on the strangers was fiercely ** i strong enough for this
doubt besieged him
it would be such a wild desperate thing to do
contempt for his indecision rose and a harsh smile danced on his lips
