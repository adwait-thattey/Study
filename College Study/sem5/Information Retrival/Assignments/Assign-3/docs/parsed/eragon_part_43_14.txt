she relaxed and curtsied again
i am nasuada she said
eragon inclined his head
you obviously know who i am but what do you want
nasuada smiled charmingly
my father ajihad sent me here with a message
would you like to hear it
the varden is leader had not struck eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood
he wondered who nasuada is mother was she must have been an uncommon woman to have attracted ajihad is eye
yes i would
nasuada tossed her hair back and recited he is pleased that you are doing well but he cautions you against actions like your benediction yesterday
they create more problems than they solve
also he urges you to proceed with the testing as soon as possible he needs to know how capable you are before he communicates with the elves
did you climb all the way up here just to tell me that eragon asked thinking of vol turin is length
nasuada shook her head
i used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels
we could have sent the message with signals but i decided to bring it myself and meet you in person
would you like to sit down asked eragon
he motioned toward saphira is cave
nasuada laughed lightly
no i am expected elsewhere
you should also know my father decreed that you may visit murtagh if you ** a somber expression disturbed her previously smooth features
i met murtagh earlier
he is anxious to speak with you
he seemed lonely you should visit ** she gave eragon directions to murtagh is cell
eragon thanked her for the news then asked what about arya is she better can i see her orik was not able to tell me much
she smiled mischievously
arya is recovering swiftly as all elves do
no one is allowed to see her except my father hrothgar and the healers
they have spent much time with her learning all that occurred during her ** she swept her eyes over saphira
i must go now
is there anything you would have me convey to ajihad on your behalf
no except a desire to visit arya
and give him my thanks for the hospitality he is shown us
i will take your words directly to him
farewell rider eragon
i hope we shall soon meet ** she curtsied and exited the dragonhold head held high
if she really came all the way up tronjheim just to meet me pulleys or no pulleys there was more to this meeting than idle chatter remarked eragon
aye said saphira withdrawing her head into the cave
eragon climbed up to her and was surprised to see solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck
the werecat was purring deeply his black tipped tail flicking back and forth
the two of them looked at eragon impudently as if to ask what
eragon shook his head laughing ** is solembum who you wanted to meet
they both blinked at him and answered yes
just wondering he said mirth still bubbling inside him
it made sense that they would befriend each other their personalities were similar and they were both creatures of magic
he sighed releasing some of the day is tension as he unbuckled zar ** do you know where angela is i could not find her and i need her advice
solembum kneaded his paws against saphira is scaled ** is somewhere in tronjheim
how soon he asked ** need to talk to her today
the werecat refused to say more despite eragon is persistent questions
he gave up and nestled against saphira
solembum is purring was a low thrum above his ** have to visit murtagh tomorrow he thought fingering brom is ring
on the morning of their third day in tronjheim eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized
he belted zar roc to his waist and slung his bow and half full quiver across his back
after a leisurely flight inside farthen dur with saphira he met orik by one of tronjheim is four main gates
eragon asked him about nasuada
an unusual girl answered orik glancing disapprovingly at zar roc
she is totally devoted to her father and spends all her time helping him
i think she does more for ajihad than he knows there have been times when she is maneuvered his enemies without ever revealing her part in it
that i do not know
ajihad was alone when he brought nasuada to farthen dur as a newborn child
he is never said where he and nasuada came from
