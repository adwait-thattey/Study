and in his heart a new joy and hope flared
at last the ra zac were dead
at last his quest for vengeance was complete
at last he had fulfilled his duty to garrow and to brom
and at last he had cast off the pall of fear and anger that he had labored beneath ever since the ra zac first appeared in carvahall
killing them had taken far longer than he expected but now the deed was done and a mighty deed it was
he allowed himself to revel in satisfaction over having accomplished such a difficult feat albeit with assistance from roran and saphira
yet to his surprise his triumph was bittersweet tainted by an unexpected sense of loss
his hunt for the ra zac had been one of his last ties to his life in palancar valley and he was loath to relinquish that bond gruesome as it was
moreover the task had given him a purpose in life when he had none it was the reason why he had originally left his home
without it a hole gaped inside of him where he had nurtured his hate for the ra zac
that he could mourn the end of such a terrible mission appalled eragon and he vowed to avoid making the same mistake twice
i refuse to become so attached to my struggle against the empire and murtagh and galbatorix that i wo not want to move on to something else when and if the time comes or worse that i will try to prolong the conflict rather than adapt to whatever happens next
he chose then to push away his misbegotten regret and to concentrate instead on his relief relief that he was free of the grim demands of his self imposed quest and that his only remaining obligations were those born of his current position
elation lightened his steps
with the ra zac gone eragon felt as if he could finally make a life for himself based not on who he had been but on who he had become a dragon rider
he smiled at the uneven horizon and laughed as he ran indifferent as to whether anyone might hear him
his voice rolled up and down the draw and around him everything seemed new and beautiful and full of promise
