please rise said nasuada
he did as he was instructed and rested a hand on the head of his hammer then waited while she inspected him
my position rarely allows me the luxury of clear direct speech roran but i will be blunt with you today
you seem to be a man who appreciates candor and we have much to discuss in a small amount of time
thank you my lady
i have never enjoyed playing word games
excellent
to be blunt then you have presented me with two difficulties neither of which i can easily resolve
he frowned
what sort of difficulties
one of character and one of politics
your deeds in palancar valley and during your flight thence with your fellow villagers are nigh on incredible
they tell me that you have a daring mind and that you are skilled at combat strategy and inspiring people to follow you with unquestioning loyalty
they may have followed me but they certainly never stopped questioning me
a smile touched her lips
perhaps
but you still got them here did not you you possess valuable talents roran and the varden could use you
i assume you wish to be of service
as you know galbatorix has divided his army and sent troops south to reinforce the city of aroughs west toward feinster and north toward belatona
he hopes to drag out this fight to bleed us dry through slow attrition
jormundur and i cannot be in a dozen locations at once
we need captains whom we can trust to deal with the myriad conflicts springing up around us
in this you could prove your worth to us
but
her voice faded
but you do not yet know if you can rely upon me
indeed
protecting one is friends and family stiffens a person is spine but i wonder how you will fare without them
will your nerve hold and while you can lead can you also obey orders i cast no aspersions on your character roran but the fate of alagaesia is at stake and i cannot risk putting someone incompetent in charge of my men
this war does not forgive such errors
nor would it be fair to the men already with the varden to place you over them without just cause
you must earn your responsibilities with us
i understand
what would you have me do then
ah but it is not that easy for you and eragon are practically brothers and that complicates things immeasurably
as i am sure you are aware eragon is the keystone of our hopes
it is important then to shelter him from distractions so he may concentrate upon the task before him
if i send you into battle and you die as a result grief and anger might very well unbalance him
i ve seen it happen before
moreover i must take great care with whom i allow you to serve for there are those who will seek to influence you because of your relation to eragon
so now you have a fair idea of the scope of my concerns
what have you to say about them
if the land itself is at stake and this war is as hotly contested as you imply then i say you cannot afford to let me sit idle
employing me as a common swordsman would be just as much a waste
but i think you know that already
as for politics
he shrugged
i do not care one whit whom you put me with
no one shall get to eragon through me
my only concern is breaking the empire so that my kith and kin can return to our home and live in peace
very
could you not allow me to remain in charge of the men from carvahall we are as close as family and we work well together
test me that way
the varden would not suffer then if i failed
she shook her head
no
perhaps in the future but not yet
they require proper instruction and i cannot judge your performance when you are surrounded by a group of people who are so loyal that at your urging they abandoned their homes and traversed the width of alagaesia
she considers me a threat he realized
my ability to influence the villagers makes her wary of me
in an attempt to disarm her he said they had their own sense to guide them
they knew it was folly to stay in the valley
you cannot explain away their behavior roran
what do you want of me lady will you let me serve or not and if so how
here is my offer
this morning my magicians detected a patrol of twenty three of galbatorix is soldiers due east
