and although i wish it were otherwise not all elves have trained their minds properly
how do you intend to teach me this logic
oromis is smile broadened
by the oldest and most effective method debating
i will ask you a question then you will answer and defend your ** he waited while eragon refilled his bowl with stew
for example why do you fight the empire
the sudden change of topic caught eragon off guard
he had a feeling that oromis had just reached the subject that he had been driving toward all along
as i said before to help those who suffer from galbatorix is rule and to a lesser extent for personal vengeance
then you fight for humanitarian reasons
that you fight to help the people who galbatorix has harmed and to stop him from hurting any more
ah but answer me this my young rider wo not your war with galbatorix cause more pain than it will ever prevent the majority of people in the empire live normal productive lives untouched by their king is madness
how can you justify invading their land destroying their homes and killing their sons and daughters
eragon gaped stunned that oromis could ask such a question galbatorix wasevil and stunned because no easy reply presented itself
he knew that he was in the right but how could he prove it do not you believe that galbatorix should be overthrown
youmust believe it though persisted eragon
look what he did to the riders
dunking his bread in his stew oromis resumed eating letting eragon fume in silence
when he finished oromis folded his hands in his lap and asked have i upset you
i see
well then continue to ponder the matter until you find an answer
i expect it to be a convincing one
