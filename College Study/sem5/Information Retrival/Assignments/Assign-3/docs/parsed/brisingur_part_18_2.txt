nasuada took his arm and while they spoke in comfortable tones guided his steps as they ambled through the sea of tents
above saphira circled the camp content to wait until they arrived at their destination before she went to the effort of landing
eragon and nasuada spoke of many things
little of consequence passed between their lips but her wit her gaiety and the thoughtfulness of her remarks charmed him
it was easy for him to talk to her and easier to listen and that very ease caused him to realize how much he cared for her
her hold on him far exceeded that of a liegelord over her vassal
it was a new feeling for him their bond
aside from his aunt marian of whom he had but faint memories he had grown up in a world of men and boys and he had never had the opportunity to be friends with a woman
his inexperience made him uncertain and his uncertainty made him awkward but nasuada did not seem to notice
she stopped him before a tent that glowed from within with the light of many candles and that hummed with a multitude of unintelligible voices
now we must dive into the swamp of politics again
prepare yourself
she swept back the entrance flap to the tent and eragon jumped as a host of people shouted ** a wide trestle table laden with food dominated the center of the tent and at the table were sitting roran and katrina twenty or so of the villagers from carvahall including horst and his family angela the herbalist jeod and his wife helen and several people eragon did not recognize but who had the look of sailors
a half dozen children had been playing on the ground next to the table they paused in their games and stared at nasuada and eragon with open mouths seemingly unable to decide which of these two strange figures deserved more of their attention
eragon grinned overwhelmed
before he could think of what to say angela raised her flagon and piped well do not just stand there ** come in sit down
i am **
as everyone laughed nasuada pulled eragon toward the two empty chairs next to roran
eragon helped nasuada to her seat and as she sank into the chair he asked did you arrange this
roran suggested whom you might want to attend but yes the original idea was mine
and i made a few additions of my own to the table as you can see
thank you said eragon humbled
thank you so much
he saw elva sitting cross legged in the far left corner of the tent a platter of food on her lap
the other children shunned her eragon could not imagine they had much in common and none of the adults save angela seemed comfortable in her presence
the small narrow shouldered girl gazed up at him from under her black bangs with her horrible violet eyes and mouthed what he guessed was greetings shadeslayer
greetings farseer he mouthed in return
her small pink lips parted in what would have been a charming smile if not for the fell orbs that burned above them
eragon gripped the arms of his chair as the table shook the dishes rattled and the walls of the tent flapped
then the back of the tent bulged and parted as saphira pushed her head inside
** she said
i smell meat
for the next few hours eragon lost himself in a blur of food drink and the pleasure of good company
it was like returning home
the wine flowed like water and after they had drained their cups once or twice the villagers forgot their deference and treated him as one of their own which was the greatest gift they could give
they were equally generous with nasuada although they refrained from making jokes at her expense as they sometimes did with eragon
pale smoke filled the tent as the candles consumed themselves
beside him eragon heard the boom of roran is laughter ring forth again and again and across the table the even deeper boom of horst is laugh
muttering an incantation angela set to dancing a small man she had fashioned from a crust of sourdough bread much to everyone is amusement
the children gradually overcame their fear of saphira and dared to walk up to her and pet her snout
soon they were clambering over her neck hanging from her spikes and tugging at the crests above her eyes
