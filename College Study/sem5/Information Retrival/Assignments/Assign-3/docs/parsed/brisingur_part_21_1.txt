how long will you be gone he asked
saphira unfurled her wings in preparation for flight
a few hours
i am hungry
once i am clean i am going to catch two or three of those plump deer i ve seen nibbling the grass on the western bank of the river
the varden have shot so many of them though i may have to fly a half dozen leagues toward the spine before i find any game worth hunting
do not go too far he cautioned else you might encounter the empire
i wo not but if i happen upon a lone group of soldiers
she licked her chops
i would enjoy a quick fight
besides humans taste just as good as deer
her eyes sparkled
maybe maybe not
it depends on whether they are wearing armor
i hate biting through metal and scooping my food out of a shell is just as annoying
i see
he glanced over at the nearest elf a tall silver haired woman
the elves wo not want you to go alone
will you allow a couple of them to ride on you otherwise it will be impossible for them to keep pace
not today
today i hunt ** with a sweep of her wings she took off soaring high overhead
as she turned west toward the jiet river her voice sounded in his mind fainter than before because of the distance between them
when i return we will fly together wo not we eragon
yes when you return we will fly together just the two of us
her pleasure at that caused him to smile as he watched her arrow away toward the west
eragon lowered his gaze as blodhgarm ran up to him lithe as a forest cat
the elf asked where saphira was going and seemed displeased with eragon is explanation but if he had any objections he kept them to himself
right eragon said to himself as blodhgarm rejoined his companions
first things first
he strode through the camp until he found a large square of open space where thirty some varden were practicing with a wide assortment of weapons
to his relief they were too busy training to notice his presence
crouching he lay his right hand palm upward on the trampled earth
he chose the words he would need from the ancient language then murmured kuldr risa lam iet un malthinae unin bollr
the soil beside his hand appeared unchanged although he could feel the spell sifting through the dirt for hundreds of feet in every direction
not more than five seconds later the surface of the earth began to boil like a pot of water left to sit for too long over a high flame and it acquired a bright yellow sheen
eragon had learned from oromis that wherever one went the land was sure to contain minute particles of nearly every element and while they would be too small and scattered to mine with traditional methods a knowledgeable magician could with great effort extract them
from the center of the yellow patch a fountain of sparkling dust arched up and over landing in the middle of eragon is palm
there each glittering mote melded into the next until three spheres of pure gold each the size of a large hazelnut rested on his hand
letta said eragon and released the magic
he sat back on his heels and braced himself against the ground as a wave of weariness washed over him
his head drooped forward and his eyelids descended halfway as his vision flickered and dimmed
taking a deep breath he admired the mirror smooth orbs in his hand while he waited for his strength to return
so pretty he thought
if only i could have done this when we were living in palancar valley
it would almost be easier to mine the gold though
a spell has not taken so much out of me since i carried sloan down from the top of helgrind
he pocketed the gold and set out again through the camp
he found a cook tent and ate a large lunch which he needed after casting so many arduous spells then headed toward the area where the villagers from carvahall were staying
as he approached he heard the ring of metal striking metal
curious he turned in that direction
eragon stepped around a line of three wagons parked across the mouth of the lane and saw horst standing in a thirty foot gap between the tents holding one end of a five foot long bar of steel
the other end of the bar was bright cherry red and rested on the face of a massive two hundred pound anvil that was staked to the top of a low wide stump
