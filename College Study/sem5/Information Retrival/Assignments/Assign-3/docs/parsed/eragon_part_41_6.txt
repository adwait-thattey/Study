ardor for this mission filled me and i fervently pledged myself to him
obviously pleased galbatorix gave me his blessing then dismissed me saying i shall call upon you when the need arises
several months passed before he did
when the summons came i felt all of my old excitement return
we met in private as before but this time he was not pleasant or charming
the varden had just destroyed three brigades in the south and his wrath was out in full force
he charged me in a terrible voice to take a detachment of troops and destroy cantos where rebels were known to hide occasionally
when i asked what we should do with the people there and how we would know if they were guilty he shouted they re all ** burn them at the stake and bury their ashes with ** he continued to rant cursing his enemies and describing how he would scourge the land of everyone who bore him ill will
his tone was so different from what i had encountered before it made me realize he did not possess the mercy or foresight to gain the people is loyalty and he ruled only through brute force guided by his own passions
it was at that moment i determined to escape him and uru baen forever
as soon as i was free of his presence i and my faithful servant tornac made ready for flight
we left that very night but somehow galbatorix anticipated my actions for there were soldiers waiting for us outside the gates
ah my sword was bloody flashing in the dim lantern glow
we defeated the men
but in the process tornac was killed
alone and filled with grief i fled to an old friend who sheltered me in his estate
while i hid i listened carefully to every rumor trying to predict galbatorix is actions and plan my future
during that time talk reached me that the ra zac had been sent to capture or kill someone
remembering the king is plans for the riders i decided to find and follow the ra zac just in case theydid discover a dragon
and that is how i found you
i have no more secrets
we still do not know if he is telling the truth warned saphira
i know said eragon but why would he lie to us
i doubt ** ran a finger over saphira is hard scales watching the light reflect off them
so why do not you join the varden they will distrust you for a time but once you prove your loyalty they will treat you with respect
and are not they in a sense your allies they strive to end the king is reign
is not that what you want
must i spell everything out for you demanded murtagh
i do not want galbatorix to learn where i am which is inevitable if people start saying that i ve sided with his enemies which i ve never done
these he paused then said with distaste rebelsare trying not only to overthrow the king but to destroy the empire
and i do not want that to happen
it would sow mayhem and anarchy
the king is flawed yes but the system itself is sound
as for earning the varden is respect ** once i am exposed they will treat me like a criminal or worse
not only that suspicion will fall upon you because we traveled **
eragon ignored her
it is not that bad he said trying to sound optimistic
murtagh snorted derisively and looked away
i am sure that they wo not be his words were cut short as the door opened a hand is breadth and two bowls were pushed through the space
a loaf of bread and a hunk of raw meat followed then the door was shut again
** grumbled murtagh going to the food
he tossed the meat to saphira who snapped it out of the air and swallowed it whole
then he tore the loaf in two gave half to eragon picked up his bowl and retreated to a corner
they ate silently
murtagh jabbed at his food
i am going to sleep he announced putting down his bowl without another word
good night said eragon
he lay next to saphira his arms under his head
she curled her long neck around him like a cat wrapping its tail around itself and laid her head alongside his
one of her wings extended over him like a blue tent enveloping him in darkness
a small smile lifted eragon is lips but he was already asleep
eragon jolted upright as a growl sounded in his ear
saphira was still asleep her eyes wandering sightlessly under her eyelids and her upper lip trembled as if she were going to snarl
