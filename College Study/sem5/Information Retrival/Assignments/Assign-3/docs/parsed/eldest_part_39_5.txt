master he asked to distract himself why do you have me meditate is it so that i will understand the doings of the animals and insects or is there more to it than that
can you think of no other motive oromis sighed when eragon shook his head
always it is thus with my new students and especially with the human ones the mind is the last muscle they train or use and the one that they regard the least
ask them about swordplay and they can list every blow from a duel a month old but ask them to solve a problem or make a coherent statement and
well i would be lucky to get more than a blank stare in return
you are still new to the world of gramarye as magic is properly called but you must begin to consider its full implications
imagine for a moment that you are galbatorix with all of his vast resources at your command
the varden have destroyed your urgal army with the help of a rival dragon rider who you know was educated at least in part by one of your most dangerous and implacable foes brom
you are also aware that your enemies are massing in surda for a possible invasion
given that what would be the easiest way to deal with these various threats short of flying into battle yourself
eragon stirred his stew to cool it while he examined the issue
it seems to me he said slowly that the easiest thing would be to train a corps of magicians they would not even have to be that powerful force them to swear loyalty to me in the ancient language then have them infiltrate surda to sabotage the varden is efforts poison wells and assassinate nasuada king orrin and other key members of the resistance
and why has not galbatorix done this yet
because until now surda was of negligible interest to him and because the varden have dwelled in farthen dur for decades where they were able to examine every newcomer is mind for duplicity which they can not do in surda since its border and population are so large
those are my very conclusions said oromis
unless galbatorix forsakes his lair in uru baen the greatest danger you re likely to encounter during the varden is campaign will come from fellow magicians
you know as well as i how difficult it is to guard against magic especially if your opponent has sworn in the ancient language to kill you no matter the cost
instead of attempting to first conquer your mind such a foe will simply cast a spell to obliterate you even though in the instant before you are destroyed you will still be free to retaliate
however you cannot fell your murderer if you do not know who or where he is
so sometimes you do not have to bother taking control of your opponent is mind
sometimes but it is a risk to ** oromis paused to consume a few spoonfuls of stew
now to address the heart of this issue how do you defend yourself against anonymous enemies who can contravene any physical precautions and slay with a muttered word
i do not see how unless
eragon hesitated then smiled
unless i was aware of the consciousnesses of all the people around me
then i could sense if they meant me harm
oromis appeared pleased by his answer
even so eragon finiarel
and that is the answer to your question
your meditations condition your mind to find and exploit flaws in your enemies mental armor no matter how small
but wo not another magic user know if i touch their mind
aye they will know but most people wo not
and as for the magicians they will know they will be afraid and they will shield their minds from you out of their fear and you will know them because of it
is not it dangerous to leave your consciousness unguarded if you re attacked mentally you could easily be overwhelmed
it is less dangerous than being blind to the world
eragon nodded
he tapped his spoon against his bowl in a measured meter of time engrossed in his thoughts then said it feels wrong
what about people is privacy brom taught me to never intrude in someone is mind unless it was absolutely necessary
i guess i am uncomfortable with the idea of prying into people is secrets
secrets that they have every right to keep to ** he cocked his head
