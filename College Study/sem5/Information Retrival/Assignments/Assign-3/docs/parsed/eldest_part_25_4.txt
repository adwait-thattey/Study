then how can you expect me to do what you wo ** she cried
that is my price and neither gold nor jewels nor pretty words can replace your oath
if you do not care enough for me to make your own sacrifice roranstronghammer then be gone and i never wish to see your face **
i cannot lose ** it pained him almost beyond endurance he bowed his head and said you have my word
katrina nodded and sank into a chair her back stiff and upright and blotted her tears on the cuff of her sleeve
in a quiet voice she said father will hate me for going
i wo not she said defiantly
he would never let me enter the spine but he has to realize that this is my decision
anyway he wo not dare pursue me into the mountains he fears them more than death itself
he may fear losing you even more
we shall see
if when the time comes to return i expect you to have already spoken to him about our engagement
that should give him enough time to reconcile himself to the fact
roran found himself nodding in agreement all the while thinking that they would be lucky if events worked out so well
