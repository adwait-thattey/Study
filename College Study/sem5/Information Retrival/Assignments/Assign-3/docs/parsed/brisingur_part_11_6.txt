hold ** you ve not been to eastcroft before have you
this is my first visit said eragon
the stubby watchman bobbed his head
and have you family or friends here to welcome you
what brings you to eastcroft then
nothing
i am traveling south to fetch my sister is family and bring them back to dras ** eragon is story seemed to have no effect on the watchman
perhaps he does not believe me eragon speculated
or perhaps he is heard so many accounts like mine they ve ceased to matter to him
then you want the wayfarers house by the main well
go there and you will find food and lodging
and while you stay here in eastcroft let me warn you we do not tolerate murder thievery or lechery in these parts
we have sturdy stocks and gallows and they have had their share of tenants
my meaning is clear
then go and be you of good fortune
but ** what is your name stranger
with that the watchman strode away returning to his evening rounds
eragon waited until the combined mass of several houses concealed the lantern the watchman carried before wandering over to the message board mounted to the left of the gates
there nailed over a half dozen posters of various criminals were two sheets of parchment almost three feet long
one depicted eragon one depicted roran and both labeled them traitors to the crown
eragon examined the posters with interest and marveled at the reward offered an earldom apiece to whoever captured them
the drawing of roran was a good likeness and even included the beard he had grown since fleeing carvahall but eragon is portrait showed him as he had been before the blood oath celebration when he still appeared fully human
how things have changed thought eragon
moving on he slipped through the village until he located the wayfarers house
the common room had a low ceiling with tarstained timbers
yellow tallow candles provided a soft flickering light and thickened the air with intersecting layers of smoke
sand and rushes covered the floor and the mixture crunched underneath eragon is boots
to his left were tables and chairs and a large fireplace where an urchin turned a pig on a spit
opposite this was a long bar a fortress with raised drawbridges that protected casks of lager ale and stout from the horde of thirsty men who assailed it from all sides
a good sixty people filled the room crowding it to an uncomfortable level
the roar of conversation would have been startling enough to eragon after his time on the road but with his sensitive hearing he felt as if he stood in the middle of a pounding waterfall
it was hard for him to concentrate upon any one voice
as soon as he caught hold of a word or a phrase it was swept away by another utterance
off in one corner a trio of minstrels was singing and playing a comic version of sweet aethrid o dauth which did nothing to improve the clamor
wincing at the barrage of noise eragon wormed his way through the crowd until he reached the bar
he wanted to talk with the serving woman but she was so busy five minutes passed before she looked at him and asked your pleasure strands of hair hung over her sweaty face
have you a room to let or a corner where i could spend the night
i would not know
the mistress of the house is the one you should speak to about that
she will be down directly said the serving woman and flicked a hand at a rank of gloomy stairs
while he waited eragon rested against the bar and studied the people in the room
they were a motley assortment
about half he guessed were villagers from eastcroft come to enjoy a night of drinking
of the rest the majority were men and women families oftentimes who were migrating to safer parts
it was easy for him to identify them by their frayed shirts and dirty pants and by how they huddled in their chairs and peered at anyone who came near
however they studiously avoided looking at the last and smallest group of patrons in the wayfarers house galbatorix is soldiers
the men in red tunics were louder than anyone else
they laughed and shouted and banged on tabletops with their armored fists while they quaffed beer and groped any maid foolish enough to walk by them
