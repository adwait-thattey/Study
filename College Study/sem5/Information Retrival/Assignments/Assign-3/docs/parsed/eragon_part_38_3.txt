would not they be a perfect hiding place for the elves or the varden
you could hide more than the elves and varden he ** nations could exist in secret there hidden from the empire
imagine living with those behemoths looming over ** guided snowfire to murtagh and pointed grinning
what grunted murtagh scanning the land
murtagh peered closely at the horizon
he shrugged
what i do not the words died in his mouth and gave way to slack jawed wonder
murtagh shook his head muttering that is ** he squinted so hard that the corners of his eyes crinkled
he shook his head again
i knew the beor mountains were large but not that monstrous **
let is hope the animals that live there are not in proportion to the mountains said eragon lightly
murtagh smiled
it will be good to find some shade and spend a few weeks in leisure
i ve had enough of this forced march
i am tired too admitted eragon but i do not want to stop until the elf is cured
or she dies
i do not see how continuing to travel will help her said murtagh gravely
a bed will do her more good than hanging underneath saphira all day
eragon shrugged
maybe
when we reach the mountains i could take her to surda it is not that far
there must be a healer there who can help her we certainly can not
murtagh shaded his eyes with his hand and stared at the mountains
we can talk about it later
for now our goal is to reach the beors
there at least the ra zac will have trouble finding us and we will be safe from the empire
as the day wore on the beor mountains seemed to get no closer though the landscape changed dramatically
the sand slowly transformed from loose grains of reddish hue to hard packed dusky cream dirt
in place of dunes were ragged patches of plants and deep furrows in the ground where flooding had occurred
a cool breeze wafted through the air bringing welcome refreshment
the horses sensed the change of climate and hurried forward eagerly
when evening subdued the sun the mountains foothills were a mere league away
herds of gazelles bounded through lush fields of waving grass
eragon caught saphira eyeing them hungrily
they camped by a stream relieved to be out of the punishing hadarac desert
