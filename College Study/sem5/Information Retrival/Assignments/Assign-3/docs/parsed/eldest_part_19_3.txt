shrrgnien laughed again
they are good for hitting things eh
eragon is curiosity and envy were aroused
how are they made i mean how are the spikes attached to your hands
shrrgnien hesitated trying to find the right words
a healer puts you in a deep sleep so you feel no pain
then a hole is isdrilled yes is drilled down through the joints
he broke off and spoke quickly to orik in the dwarf language
a metal socket is embedded in each hole explained orik
magic is used to seal it in place and when the warrior has fully recovered various sized spikes can be threaded into the sockets
yes see said shrrgnien grinning
he gripped the stud above his left index finger carefully twisted it free of his knuckle and then handed it to eragon
eragon smiled as he rolled the sharp lump around his palm
i would not mind having fists of steel ** he returned the stud to shrrgnien
it is a dangerous operation warned orik
few knurlan get ascudgamln because you can easily lose the use of your hands if the drill goes too ** he raised his fist and showed it to eragon
our bones are thicker than yours
it might not work for a human
i will remember ** still eragon could not help but imagine what it would be like to fight with ascudgamln to be able to strike anything he wanted with impunity including armored urgals
he loved the idea
after eating eragon retired to his tent
the fire provided enough light that he could see the silhouette of saphira nestled alongside the tent like a figure cut from black paper and pasted against the canvas wall
eragon sat with the blankets pulled over his legs and stared at his lap drowsy but unwilling to sleep quite yet
unbidden his mind turned to thoughts of home
he wondered how roran horst and everyone else from carvahall was doing and if the weather in palancar valley was warm enough for the farmers to start planting their crops
longing and sadness suddenly gripped eragon
he removed a wood bowl from his pack and taking his waterskin filled it to the brim with liquid
then he focused on an image of roran and whispered draumr kopa
as always the water went black before brightening to reveal the object being scryed
eragon saw roran sitting alone in a candlelit bedroom he recognized from horst is ** must have given up his job in therinsford realized eragon
his cousin leaned on his knees and clasped his hands staring at the far wall with an expression that eragon knew meant roran was grappling with some difficult problem
still roran seemed well enough if a bit drawn which comforted eragon
after a minute he released the magic ending the spell and clearing the surface of the water
reassured eragon emptied the bowl then lay down pulling the blankets up to his chin
he closed his eyes and sank into the warm dusk that separates consciousness and sleep where reality bends and sways to the wind of thought and where creativity blossoms in its freedom from boundaries and all things are possible
slumber soon took him
most of his rest was uneventful but right before he woke the usual night phantasms were replaced with a vision as clear and vibrant as any waking experience
he saw a tortured sky black and crimson with smoke
crows and eagles swirled high above flights of arrows that arched from one side to another of a great battle
a man sprawled in the clotted mud with a dented helm and bloody mail his face concealed behind an upthrown arm
an armored hand entered eragon is view
the gauntlet was so near it blotted out half the world with polished steel
like an inexorable machine the thumb and last three fingers curled into a fist leaving the trunk of the index finger to point at the downed man with all the authority of fate itself
the vision still filled eragon is mind when he crawled out of the tent
he found saphira some distance from the camp gnawing on a furry lump
when he told her what he had seen she paused in midbite then jerked her neck and swallowed a strip of meat
the last time this occurred she said it proved to be a true prediction of events elsewhere
do you think a battle is in progress in alagaesia
