it unsettled him to think that brom might have considered him a ** he was right too
look what ended up happening to me
saphira ruffled his hair with a gust of her hot ** remember whatever brom is reasons he always tried to protect us from danger
he died saving you from the ra zac
i know
do you think he did not tell me about this because he was afraid i might emulate morzan like murtagh has
he looked at her ** can you be so certain she lifted her head high above him and refused to meet his eyes or to ** it your way then
kneeling by one of king orrin is men who had an arrow through the gut eragon grabbed his arms to stop him from writhing
easy now
water groaned the man
for pity is sake water
my throat is as dry as sand
please ** sweat beaded his face
eragon smiled trying to comfort him
i can give you a drink now but it d be better if you wait until after i heal you
can you wait if you do i promise you can have all the water you want
the man visibly struggled against another wave of agony before saying if i must
with the aid of magic eragon drew out the shaft then he and saphira worked to repair the man is innards using some of the warrior is own energy to fuel the spell
it took several minutes
afterward the man examined his belly pressing his hands against the flawless skin then gazed at eragon tears brimming in his eyes
i
shadeslayer you
eragon handed him his waterskin
here keep it
you have greater need of it than i
a hundred yards beyond eragon and saphira breached an acrid wall of smoke
there they came upon orik and ten other dwarves some women arrayed around the body of hrothgar who lay upon four shields resplendent in his golden mail
the dwarves tore at their hair beat their breasts and wailed their lamentations to the sky
eragon bowed his head and murmured stydja unin mor ranr hrothgar konungr
after a time orik noticed them and rose his face red from crying and his beard torn free of its usual braid
he staggered over to eragon and without preempt asked did you kill the coward responsible for this
he ** eragon could not bring himself to explain that the rider was murtagh
orik stamped his fist into his hand
**
but i swear to you upon every stone in alagaesia that as one of durgrimst ingeitum i will do everything i can to avenge hrothgar is death
aye you re the only one besides the elves strong enough to bring this foul murderer to justice
and when you find him
grind his bones to dust eragon
pull his teeth and fill his veins with molten lead make him suffer for every minute of hrothgar is life that he stole
was not it a good death would not hrothgar have wanted to die in battle with volund in his hand
in battle yes facing an honest foe who dared stand and fight like a man
not brought low by a magician is trickery
shaking his head orik looked back at hrothgar then crossed his arms and tucked his chin against his collarbone
he took several ragged breaths
when my parents died of the pox hrothgar gave me a life again
he took me into his hall
he made me his heir
losing him
orik pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger covering his face
losing him is like losing my father again
the grief in his voice was so clear eragon felt as if he shared the dwarf is sorrow
i understand he said
i know you do eragon
i know you ** after a moment orik wiped his eyes and gestured at the ten dwarves
before anything else is done we have to return hrothgar to farthen dur so he can be entombed with his predecessors
durgrimst ingeitum must choose a new grimstborith and then the thirteen clan chiefs including the ones you see here will select our next king from among themselves
what happens next i know not
this tragedy will embolden some clans and turn others against our cause
he shook his head again
eragon put his hand on orik is shoulder
do not worry about that now
you have but to ask and my arm and my will are at your service
if you want come to my tent and we can share a cask of mead and toast hrothgar is memory
i d like that
but not yet
not until we finish pleading with the gods to grant hrothgar safe passage to the ** leaving eragon orik returned to the circle of dwarves and added his voice to their keening
