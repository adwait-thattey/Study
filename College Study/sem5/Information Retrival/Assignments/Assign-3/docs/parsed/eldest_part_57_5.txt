the mirror shimmered and turned white except for nine people clustered around an invisible table
of them eragon was familiar with nasuada and the council of elders
but he could not identify a strange girl hooded in black who lurked behind nasuada
this puzzled him for a magician could only scry things that he had already seen and eragon was certain he had never laid eyes upon the girl before
he forgot about her though as he noticed that the men and even nasuada were armed for battle
let us hear their words suggested saphira
the instant eragon made the needed alteration to the spell nasuada is voice emanated from the mirror
and confusion will destroy us
our warriors can afford but one commander during this conflict
decide who it is to be orrin and quickly too
eragon heard a disembodied sigh
as you wish the position is yours
enough irwin ordered the king
she has more experience in war than anyone in surda
and the varden are the only force to have defeated one of galbatorix is armies
if nasuada were a surdan general which would be peculiar indeed i admit you would not hesitate to nominate her for the post
i shall be happy to deal with questions of authority if they arise afterward for they will mean i am still on my feet and not lying in a grave
as it is we are so outnumbered i fear we are doomed unless hrothgar can reach us before the end of the week
now where is that blasted scroll on the supply train
ah thank you arya
three more days without
after that the discussion turned to a shortage of bowstrings which eragon could glean nothing useful from so he ended the spell
the mirror cleared and he found himself staring at his own face
she lives he murmured
his relief was overshadowed though by the larger meaning of what they had heard
saphira looked at ** are needed
aye
why has not oromis told us about this he must know of it
maybe he wanted to avoid disrupting our training
troubled eragon wondered what else of import was happening in alagaesia that he was unaware **
with a pang of guilt eragon realized that it had been weeks since he last thought of his cousin and even longer since he scryed him on the way to ellesmera
at eragon is command the mirror revealed two figures standing against a pure white background
it took eragon a long moment to recognize the man on the right as roran
he was garbed in travel worn clothes a hammer was stuck under his belt a thick beard obscured his face and he bore a haunted expression that bespoke desperation
to the left was jeod
the men surged up and down accompanied by the thunderous crash of waves which masked anything they said
after a while roran turned and walked along what eragon assumed was the deck of a ship bringing dozens of other villagers into view
where are they and why is jeod with them demanded eragon bewildered
diverting the magic he scryed in quick succession teirm shocked to see that the city is wharfs had been destroyed therinsford garrow is old farm and then carvahall whereupon eragon uttered a wounded cry
every building including horst is magnificent house had been burned to the ground
carvahall no longer existed except as a sooty blot beside the anora river
the sole remaining inhabitants were four gray wolves that loped through the wreckage
the mirror dropped from eragon is hand and shattered across the floor
he leaned against saphira tears burning in his eyes as he grieved anew for his lost home
saphira hummed deep in her chest and brushed his arm with the side of her jaw enveloping him in a warm blanket of ** comfort little one
at least your friends are still alive
he shuddered and felt a hard core of determination coalesce in his ** have remained sequestered from the world for far too long
it is high time we leave ellesmera and confront our fate whatever it may be
for now roran must fend for himself but the varden
the varden we can help
is it time to fight eragon asked saphira an odd note of formality in her voice
he knew what she meant was it time to challenge the empire head on time to kill and rampage to the limit of their considerable abilities time to unleash every ounce of their rage until galbatorix lay dead before them was it time to commit themselves to a campaign that could take decades to resolve
