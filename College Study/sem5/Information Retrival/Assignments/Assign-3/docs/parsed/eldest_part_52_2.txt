jeod is interest concerned roran it was as if the merchant knew or suspected what he was hiding
it seems to me said jeod at the completion of roran is inventory that this would be enough provisions to transport several hundred people to feinster or aroughs
or beyond
admittedly i ve been rather occupied for the past few weeks but i ve heard of no such host in this area nor can i imagine where one might have come from
his face blank roran met jeod is stare and said nothing
on the inside he seethed with self contempt for allowing jeod to amass enough information to reach that conclusion
jeod shrugged
well be as it may that is your own concern
i d suggest that you see galton on market street about your food and old hamill by the docks for all else
they re both honest men and will treat you true and ** reaching over he plucked a pastry from the tray took a bite and then when he finished chewing asked nolfavrell so young kell have you enjoyed your stay in teirm
yes sir said nolfavrell and grinned
i ve never seen anything quite so large sir
feeling that they were in dangerous territory roran interrupted i am curious sir as to the nature of the shop next to your house
it seems odd to have such a humble store among all these grand buildings
for the first time a smile if only a small one brightened jeod is expression erasing years from his appearance
well it was owned by a woman who was a bit odd herself angela the herbalist one of the best healers i ve ever met
she tended that store for twenty some years and then only a few months ago up and sold it and left for parts ** he sighed
it is a pity for she made an interesting neighbor
that is who gertrude wanted to meet is not it asked nolfavrell and looked up at his mother
roran suppressed a snarl and flashed a warning glance strong enough to make nolfavrell quail in his chair
the name would mean nothing to jeod but unless nolfavrell guarded his tongue better he was liable to blurt out something far more ** to go thought roran
he put down his goblet
it was then that he saw the namedid mean something to jeod
the merchant is eyes widened with surprise and he gripped the arms of his chair until the tips of his fingers turned bone white
it can not ** jeod focused on roran studying his face as if trying to see past the beard and then breathed roran
