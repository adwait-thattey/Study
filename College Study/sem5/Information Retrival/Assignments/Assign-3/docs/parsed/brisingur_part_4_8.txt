a plume of dark gray smoke erupted from saphira is nostrils as she made a choking like noise
eragon ignored her suppressed merriment and said arya is an elf
and very beautiful
pointed ears and slanted eyes are small flaws when compared with her charms
you look like a cat yourself now
arya is over a hundred years old
that particular piece of information caught roran by surprise his eyebrows went up and he said i find that hard to ** she is in the prime of her youth
well be that as it may these are reasons you give me eragon and the heart rarely listens to reason
do you fancy her or not
if he fancied her any more saphira said to both eragon and roran i d be trying to kiss arya myself
** mortified eragon swatted her on the leg
roran was prudent enough not to rib eragon further
then answer my original question and tell me how things stand between you and arya
have you spoken to her or her family about this i have found it is unwise to let such matters fester
aye said eragon and stared at the length of polished hawthorn
i spoke with her
to what end when eragon did not immediately reply roran uttered a frustrated exclamation
getting answers out of you is harder than dragging birka through the ** eragon chuckled at the mention of birka one of their draft horses
saphira will you solve this puzzle for me otherwise i fear i will never get a full explanation
to no end
no end at all
she will not have ** eragon spoke dispassionately as if commenting on a stranger is misfortune but within him raged a torrent of hurt so deep and wild he felt saphira withdraw somewhat from him
eragon forced a swallow past the lump in his throat past the bruise that was his heart and down to the knotted skein of his stomach
it happens
i know it may seem unlikely at the moment said roran but i am sure you will meet another woman who will make you forget this arya
there are countless maids and more than a few married women i d wager who would be delighted to catch the eye of a rider
you will have no trouble finding a wife among all the lovelies in alagaesia
and what would you have done if katrina rejected your suit
the question struck roran dumb it was obvious he could not imagine how he might have reacted
eragon continued
contrary to what you arya and everyone else seem to believe i am aware that other eligible women exist in alagaesia and that people have been known to fall in love more than once
no doubt if i spent my days in the company of ladies from king orrin is court i might indeed decide that i fancy one
however my path is not so easy as that
regardless of whether i can shift my affections to another and the heart as you observed is a notoriously fickle beast the question remains should i
your tongue has grown as twisted as the roots of a fir tree said roran
speak not in riddles
very well what human woman can begin to understand who and what i am or the extent of my powers who could share in my life few enough and all of them magicians
and of that select group or even of women in general how many are immortal
roran laughed a rough hearty bellow that rang loud in the gulch
you might as well ask for the sun in your pocket or he stopped and tensed as if he were about to spring forward and then became unnaturally still
you cannot be
roran struggled to find words
is it a result of your change in ellesmera or is it part of being a rider
that explains why galbatorix has not died
the branch roran had added to the fire burst asunder with a muted pop as the coals underneath heated the gnarled length of wood to the point where a small cache of water or sap that had somehow evaded the rays of the sun for untold decades exploded into steam
the idea is so
vast it is almost inconceivable said roran
death is part of who we are
it guides us
it shapes us
it drives us to madness
can you still be human if you have no mortal end
i am not invincible eragon pointed out
i can still be killed with a sword or an arrow
and i can still catch some incurable disease
but if you avoid those dangers you will live forever
if i do then yes
saphira and i will endure
