he tried for months without success
his methods were
harsh
when torture failed he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would
fortunately i still had the strength to nudge their minds and make them incapable
at last galbatorix ordered that i was to be brought to uru baen
dread filled me when i learned this as i was weary in both mind and body and had no strength to resist him
if it were not for you i would have stood before galbatorix in a week is time
eragon shuddered inwardly
it was amazing what she had survived
the memory of her injuries was still vivid in his mind
softly he asked why do you tell me all this
so that you know what i was saved from
do not presume i can ignore your deed
humbled he bowed his head
what will you do now return to ellesmera
no not yet
there is much that must be done here
i cannot abandon the varden ajihad needs my help
i ve seen you tested in both arms and magic today
brom taught you well
you are ready to proceed in your training
you mean for me to go to ellesmera
eragon felt a flash of irritation
did he and saphira have no say in the matter when
that is yet to be decided but not for some weeks
at least they gave us that much time thought eragon
saphira mentioned something to him and he in turn asked arya what did the twins want me to do
arya is sculpted lip curled with disgust
something not even they can accomplish
it is possible to speak the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its true form
it takes years of work and great discipline but the reward is complete control over the object
that is why one is true name is always kept hidden for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts they could dominate you utterly
it is strange said eragon after a moment but before i was captured at gil ead i had visions of you in my dreams
it was like scrying and i was able to scry you later but it was always during my sleep
arya pursed her lips pensively
there were times i felt as if another presence was watching me but i was often confused and feverish
i ve never heard of anyone either in lore or legend being able to scry in their sleep
i do not understand it myself said eragon looking at his hands
he twirled brom is ring around his finger
what does the tattoo on your shoulder mean i did not mean to see it but when i was healing your wounds
it could not be helped
it is just like the symbol on this ring
you have a ring with the yawe on it she asked sharply
he held out the ring
arya examined the sapphire then said this is a token given only to the most valued elf friends so valued in fact it has not been used in centuries
or so i thought
i never knew that queen islanzadi thought so highly of brom
i should not wear it then said eragon afraid that he had been presumptuous
no keep it
it will give you protection if you meet my people by chance and it may help you gain favor with the queen
tell no one of my tattoo
it should not be revealed
he enjoyed talking with arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer
when they parted he wandered through farthen dur conversing with saphira
despite his prodding she refused to tell him what arya had said to her
eventually his thoughts turned to murtagh and then to nasuada is ** will get something to eat then go see him he ** you wait for me so i can return to the dragonhold with you
with a grateful smile eragon dashed to tronjheim ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen then followed nasuada is instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a man and a dwarf
when he requested entrance the dwarf banged on the door three times then unbolted it
just holler when you want to leave said the man with a friendly smile
the cell was warm and well lit with a washbasin in one corner and a writing desk equipped with quills and ink in another
the ceiling was extensively carved with lacquered figures the floor was covered with a plush rug
murtagh lay on a stout bed reading a scroll
he looked up in surprise and exclaimed cheerily ** i d hoped you would **
how did
i mean i thought
you thought i was stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack said murtagh rolling upright with a grin
