she lay basking on a smooth shelf of stone several feet above eragon is empty cloth shell tent
the night is activities flying around scouting the empire is locations as she had every night since nasuada sent eragon to the big hollow mountain farthen dur had left her drowsy
the flights were necessary to conceal eragon is absence but the routine wore on her for while the dark held no terrors for her she was not nocturnal by habit and she disliked having to do anything with such regularity
also since it took the varden so long to move from place to place she spent most of her time soaring over much the same landscape every night
the only recent excitement was when she spotted stunted thoughts red scales thorn low on the northeastern horizon the previous morning
he had not turned to confront her however but had continued on his way heading deeper into the empire
when saphira had reported what she had seen nasuada arya and the elves guarding saphira had reacted like a flock of frightened jays screaming and yammering at each other while darting every which way
they had even insisted that black blue wolf hair blodhgarm fly with her in the guise of eragon which of course she had refused to allow
it was one thing to permit the elf to place a water shadow ghost of eragon on her back every time she took off from or landed among the varden but she was not about to let anyone other than eragon ride her unless a battle was imminent and perhaps not even then
saphira yawned and stretched out her right foreleg spreading the clawed fingers of her paw
relaxing again she wrapped her tail around her body and adjusted the position of her head on her paws visions of deer and other prey drifting through her mind
not long afterward she heard the patter of feet as someone ran through the camp heading toward nasuada is folded wing red butterfly chrysalis tent
saphira paid little attention to the sound messengers were always hurrying to and fro
just as she was about to fall asleep saphira heard another runner dash past then after a brief interval two more
without opening her eyes she extended the tip of her tongue and tasted the air
she detected no unusual odors
deciding that the disturbance was not worth investigating she drifted off into dreams of diving for fish in a cool green lake
she did not stir as she listened to a large number of round ear two legs arguing with each other
they were too far away for her to make out the words but from the tone of their voices she could tell they were angry enough to kill
disputes sometimes broke out among the varden just as they did in any large herd but never before had she heard so many two legs argue for so long and with so much passion
a dull throbbing formed at the base of saphira is skull as the two legs shouting intensified
she tightened her claws against the stone beneath her and with sharp cracks thin wafers of the quartz laden rock flaked off around the tips of her talons
i shall count to thirty three she thought and if they have not stopped by then they had better hope that whatever upset them was worth disrupting the rest of a daughter of the wind
when saphira reached the count of seven and twenty the two legs fell silent
at ** shifting to a more comfortable position she prepared to resume her much needed slumber
metal clinked plant cloth hides swished skin paw coverings thudded against the ground and the unmistakable scent of dark skin warrior nasuada wafted over saphira
what now she wondered and briefly considered roaring at everyone until they fled in terror and left her alone
saphira opened a single eye and saw nasuada and her six guards striding toward where she lay
at the lower end of the slab of stone nasuada ordered her guards to remain behind with blodhgarm and the other elves who were sparring with each other on a small expanse of grass and then she climbed the slab by herself
greetings saphira nasuada said
she wore a red dress and the color seemed unnaturally strong against the green leaves of the apple trees behind her
glints of light from saphira is scales mottled her face
