closing his eyes eragon located the minds of the prisoners in helgrind muttered a burst of the ancient language then said to roran i sealed off katrina is cell so the ra zac can not use her as a hostage
only you and i can open the door now
good said roran through clenched teeth
can you do something about this he jerked his chin toward the spot he had clamped his right hand over
blood welled between his fingers
eragon probed the wound
as soon as he touched it roran flinched and recoiled
you re lucky said eragon
the sword hit a ** placing one hand on the injury and the other on the twelve diamonds concealed inside the belt of beloth the wise strapped around his waist eragon drew upon the power he had stored within the gems
waise ** a ripple traversed roran is side as the magic knit his skin and muscle back together again
then eragon healed his own wound the gash on his left knee
finished he straightened and glanced in the direction that saphira had gone
his connection with her was fading as she chased the lethrblaka toward leona lake
he yearned to help her but knew that for the time being she would have to fend for herself
hurry said roran
they re getting **
hefting his staff eragon approached the unlit tunnel and flicked his gaze from one stone protrusion to another expecting the ra zac to spring out from behind one of them
he moved slowly in order that his footsteps would not echo in the winding shaft
when he happened to touch a rock to steady himself he found it coated in slime
after a score of yards several folds and twists in the passageway hid the main cavern and plunged them into a gloom so profound even eragon found it impossible to see
maybe you re different but i can not fight in the dark whispered roran
if i make a light the ra zac wo not come near us not when i now know a spell that works on them
they will just hide until we leave
we have to kill them while we have the chance
what am i supposed to do i am more likely to run into a wall and break my nose than i am to find those two beetles
they could sneak around behind us and stab us in the back
shh
hold on to my belt follow me and be ready to duck
eragon could not see but he could still hear smell touch and taste and those faculties were sensitive enough that he had a fair idea of what lay nearby
the greatest danger was that the ra zac would attack from a distance perhaps with a bow but he trusted that his reflexes were sharp enough to save roran and himself from an oncoming missile
a current of air tickled eragon is skin then paused and reversed itself as pressure from the outside waxed and waned
the cycle repeated itself at inconsistent intervals creating invisible eddies that brushed against him like fountains of roiling water
his breathing and roran is was loud and ragged compared with the odd assortment of sounds that propagated through the tunnel
above the gusts of their respiration eragon caught the tink clink clatter of a stone falling somewhere in the tangle of branching tubes and the steady doink
doink
doink of condensed droplets striking the drumlike surface of a subterranean pool
he also heard the grind of pea sized gravel crushed underneath the soles of his boots
a long eerie moan wavered somewhere far ahead of them
of smells none were new sweat blood damp and mold
step by step eragon led the way as they burrowed farther into the bowels of helgrind
the tunnel slanted downward and often split or turned so that eragon would have soon been lost if he had not been able to use katrina is mind as a reference point
the various knobby holes were low and cramped
once when eragon bumped his head against the ceiling a sudden flare of claustro phobia unnerved him
i am back saphira announced just as eragon put his foot on a rugged step hewn out of the rock below him
he paused
she had escaped additional injury which relieved him
floating belly up in leona lake
i am afraid that some fishermen saw our battle
they were rowing toward dras leona when i last saw them
well it can not be helped
see what you can find in the tunnel the lethrblaka came out of
