horst met his eye for a long minute
you ve become a hard man roran harder than i will ever be
mind that you do not forget who you are
roran spent the next three hours moving and packing the villagers belongings in thered boar until clovis expressed his satisfaction
the bundles had to be secured so that they would not shift unexpectedly and injure someone as well as distributed so that the barge rode level in the water which was no easy task as the bundles were of irregular size and density
then the animals were coaxed on board much to their displeasure and immobilized by tethers lashed to iron rings in the hold
last of all came the people who like the rest of the cargo had to be organized into a symmetrical pattern within the barge to keep from capsizing it
clovis torson and flint each ended up standing at the fore of their barges shouting directions to the mass of villagers below
what now thought roran as he heard an argument break out on the beach
pushing his way to the source of the disturbance he saw calitha kneeling beside her stepfather wayland trying to calm the old man
** i wo not go on thatbeast ** you can not make me cried wayland
he thrashed his withered arms and beat his heels in an attempt to free himself from calitha is embrace
spittle flew from his lips
let mego i say
let me **
wincing from his blows calitha said he is been unreasonable ever since we made camp last night
it would have been better for all concerned if he had died in the spine what with the trouble he is caused thought roran
he joined calitha and together they managed to soothe wayland so that he no longer screamed and hit
as a reward for his good behavior calitha gave him a piece of jerky which occupied his entire attention
while wayland concentrated on gumming the meat she and roran were able to guide him onto theedeline and get him settled in a deserted corner where he would not be a nuisance
move your backsides you lubbers shouted clovis
the tide is about to turn
hop to hop to
after a final flurry of activity the gangplanks were withdrawn leaving a cluster of twenty men standing on the beach before each barge
the three groups gathered around the prows and prepared to push them back into the water
roran led the effort on thered boar
chanting in unison he and his men strained against the weight of the huge barge the gray sand giving beneath their feet the timbers and cables creaking and the smell of sweat in the air
for a moment their efforts seemed to be in vain then thered boar lurched and slid back a foot
** shouted roran
foot by foot they advanced into the sea until the frigid water surged about their waists
a breaker crashed over roran filling his mouth with seawater which he spat out vigorously disgusted by the taste of salt it was far more intense than he expected
when the barge lifted free of the seabed roran swam alongside thered boar and pulled himself up with one of the ropes draped over the gunwale
meanwhile the sailors deployed long poles that they used to propel thered boar into ever deeper water as did the crews of themerrybell andedeline
the instant they were a reasonable distance from shore clovis ordered the poles stowed away and oars broken out with which the sailors aimed thered boar is prow toward the cove is entrance
they hoisted the sail aligned it to catch the light wind and at the vanguard of the trio of barges set forth for teirm upon the uncertain expanse of the bounding main
