last of all he replaced his regular gloves with his mail backed gauntlets
zar roc he hung on his left hip using the belt of beloth the wise
across his back he placed the quiver of white swan feathers islanzadi had given him
the quiver he was pleased to find could also hold the bow the elf queen had sung for him even when it was strung
after depositing his and orik is belongings into the pavilion eragon and saphira set out together to find trianna the current leader of du vrangr gata
they had gone no more than a few paces when eragon sensed a nearby mind that was shielded from his view
assuming that it was one of the varden is magicians they veered toward it
twelve yards from their starting point they came upon a small green tent with a donkey picketed in front
to the left of the tent a blackened iron cauldron hung from a metal tripod placed over one of the malodorous flames birthed deep within the earth
cords were strung about the cauldron over which were draped nightshade hemlock rhododendron savin bark of the yew tree and numerous mushrooms such as death cap and spotted cort all of which eragon recognized from oromis is lessons on poison
and standing next to the cauldron wielding a long wood paddle with which she stirred the brew was angela the herbalist
at her feet sat solembum
the werecat uttered a mournful meow and angela looked up from her task her corkscrew hair forming a billowing thundercloud around her glistening face
she frowned and her expression became positively ghoulish for it was lit from beneath by the flickering green flame
so you ve returned **
is that all you have to say for yourself have you seen elva yet have you seen what you did to that poor girl
** cried angela
how inarticulate can a person be all this time in ellesmera being tutored by the elves andaye is the best you can manage let me tell you something blockhead anyone who is stupid enough to do what you did deserves
eragon clasped his hands behind his back and waited as angela informed him in many explicit detailed and highly inventive terms exactly how great a blockhead he was what kind of ancestors he must possess to be such a monumental blockhead she even went so far as to insinuate that one of his grandparents had mated with an urgal and the quite hideous punishments he ought to receive for his idiocy
if anyone else had insulted him in that manner eragon would have challenged them to a duel but he tolerated her spleen because he knew he could not judge her behavior by the same standards as he did others and because he knew her outrage was justified he had made a dreadful mistake
when she finally paused for breath he said you re quite right and i am going to try to remove the spell once the battle is decided
angela blinked three times one right after the other and her mouth remained open for a moment in a small o before she clamped it shut
with a glare of suspicion she asked you re not saying that just to placate me are you
and you really intend to undo your curse i thought such things were irrevocable
the elves have discovered many uses of magic
ah
well then that is settled is not it she flashed him a wide smile and then strode past him to pat saphira on her jowls
it is good to see you again saphira
you ve grown
as angela returned to stirring her concoction eragon said that was an impressive tirade you gave
thank you
i worked on it for several weeks
it is a pity you did not get to hear the ending it ismemorable
i could finish it for you if you want
no that is all right
i can imagine what it is ** glancing at her out of the corner of his eye eragon then said you do not seem surprised by how i ve changed
the herbalist shrugged
i have my sources
it is an improvement in my opinion
you were a bit
oh how shall i say it
unfinished before
that i ** he gestured at the hanging plants
what do you plan to do with these
oh it is just a little project of mine an experiment if you will
** examining the pattern of colors on a dried mushroom that dangled before him eragon asked did you ever figure out if toads exist or not
