the pebble punctured the side of his helm
before the soldiers could react eragon twisted around yanked the spear from the hands of the man who had been tormenting him and used it to knock him off his horse
as the man landed eragon stabbed him through the heart breaking the blade of the spear on the metal plates of the soldier is gambeson
releasing the spear eragon dove backward his body parallel with the ground as he passed underneath seven spears that were flying toward where he had been
the lethal shafts seemed to float above him as he fell
the instant eragon had released the pebble arya bounded up the side of the horse nearest her jumping from stirrup to saddle and kicked the head of the oblivious soldier who was perched on the mare
he went hurtling more than thirty feet
then arya leaped from the back of horse to horse killing the soldiers with her knees her feet and her hands in an incredible display of grace and balance
jagged rocks tore at eragon is stomach as he tumbled to a stop
grimacing he sprang upright
four soldiers who had dismounted confronted him with drawn swords
they charged
dodging to the right he caught the first soldier is wrist as the man swung his sword and punched him in the armpit
the man collapsed and was still
eragon dispatched his next opponents by twisting their heads until their spines snapped
the fourth soldier was so close by then running at him with sword held high eragon could not evade him
trapped he did the one thing he could he struck the man in the chest with all his might
a fount of blood and sweat erupted as his fist connected
the blow staved in the man is ribs and propelled him more than a dozen feet over the grass where he fetched up against another corpse
eragon gasped and doubled over cradling his throbbing hand
four of his knuckles were disjointed and white cartilage showed through his mangled skin
blast he thought as hot blood poured from the wounds
his fingers refused to move when he ordered them to he realized that his hand would be useless until he could heal it
fearing another attack he looked around for arya and the rest of the soldiers
the horses had scattered
only three soldiers remained alive
arya was grappling with two of them some distance away while the third and final soldier fled south along the road
gathering his strength eragon pursued him
as he narrowed the gap between them the man began to plead for mercy promising he would tell no one about the massacre and holding out his hands to show they were empty
when eragon was within arm is reach the man veered to the side and then a few steps later changed direction again darting back and forth across the countryside like a frightened jack rabbit
all the while the man continued to beg tears streaming down his cheeks saying that he was too young to die that he had yet to marry and father a child that his parents would miss him and that he had been pressed into the army and this was only his fifth mission and why could not eragon leave him alone what have you against me he sobbed
i only did what i had to
i am a good **
eragon paused and forced himself to say you can not keep up with us
we can not leave you you will catch a horse and betray us
people will ask what happened here
your oath to galbatorix and the empire wo not let you lie
i am sorry but i do not know how to release you from your bond except
why are you doing this you re a ** screamed the man
with an expression of pure terror he made an attempt to dash around eragon and return to the road
eragon overtook him in less than ten feet and as the man was still crying and asking for clemency eragon wrapped his left hand around his neck and squeezed
when he relaxed his grip the soldier fell across his feet dead
bile coated eragon is tongue as he stared down at the man is slack face
whenever we kill we kill a part of ourselves he thought
shaking with a combination of shock pain and self loathing he walked back to where the fight had begun
arya was kneeling beside a body washing her hands and arms with water from a tin flask one of the soldiers had been carrying
