they landed before the hut and were met by oromis and glaedr
oromis examined saphira is saddle
he traced each strap with his fingers pausing on the stitching and buckles and then pronounced it passable handiwork considering how and when it had been constructed
brom was always clever with his hands
use this saddle when you must travel with great speed
but when comfort is allowed he stepped into his hut for a moment and reappeared carrying a thick molded saddle decorated with gilt designs along the seat and leg pieces
use this
it was crafted in vroengard and imbued with many spells so that it will never fail you in time of need
eragon staggered under the weight of the saddle as he received it from oromis
it had the same general shape as brom is with a row of buckles intended to immobilize his legs hanging from each side
the deep seat was sculpted out of the leather in such a way that he could fly for hours with ease both sitting upright and lying flat against saphira is neck
also the straps encircling saphira is chest were rigged with slips and knots so that they could extend to accommodate years of growth
a series of broad ties on either side of the head of the saddle caught eragon is attention
he asked their purpose
glaedr rumbled those secure your wrists and arms so that you are not killed like a rat shaken to death when saphira performs a complex maneuver
oromis helped eragon relieve saphira of her current saddle
saphira you will go with glaedr today and i will work with eragon here
as you wish she said and crowed with excitement
heaving his golden bulk off the ground glaedr soared off to the north saphira close behind
oromis did not give eragon long to ponder saphira is departure the elf marched him to a square of hard packed dirt beneath a willow tree at the far side of the clearing
standing opposite him in the square oromis said what i am about to show you is called the rimgar or the dance of snake and crane
it is a series of poses that we developed to prepare our warriors for combat although all elves use it now to maintain their health and fitness
the rimgar consists of four levels each more difficult than the last
we will start with the first
apprehension for the coming ordeal sickened eragon to the point where he could barely move
he clenched his fists and hunched his shoulders his scar tugging at the skin of his back as he glared between his feet
relax advised oromis
eragon jerked open his hands and let them hang limply at the end of his rigid arms
i asked you to relax eragon
you can not do the rimgar if you are as stiff as a piece of rawhide
yes ** eragon grimaced and reluctantly loosened his muscles and joints although a knot of tension remained coiled in his belly
place your feet together and your arms at your sides
look straight ahead
now take a deep breath and lift your arms over your head so that your palms meet
yes like that
exhale and bend down as far as you can put your palms on the ground take another breath
and jump back
good
breathe in and bend up looking toward the sky
and exhale lifting your hips until you form a triangle
breathe in through the back of your throat
and out
in
and out
in
to eragon is utter relief the stances proved gentle enough to hold without igniting the pain in his back yet challenging enough that sweat beaded his forehead and he panted for breath
he found himself grinning with joy at his reprieve
his wariness evaporated and he flowed through the postures most of which far exceeded his flexibility with more energy and confidence than he had possessed since before the battle in farthen ** i ve healed
oromis performed the rimgar with him displaying a level of strength and flexibility that astounded eragon especially for one so old
the elf could touch his forehead to his toes
throughout the exercise oromis remained impeccably composed as if he were doing no more than strolling down a garden path
his instruction was calmer and more patient than brom is yet completely unyielding
no deviation was allowed from the correct path
let us wash the sweat from our limbs said oromis when they finished
