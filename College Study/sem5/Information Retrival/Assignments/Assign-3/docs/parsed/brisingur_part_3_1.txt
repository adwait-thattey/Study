he was lying on his belly behind the edge of a sandy hill dotted with sparse blades of grass thornbushes and small rosebudlike cactuses
the brittle stems of last year is foliage pricked his palms as he inched forward to gain a better view of helgrind which loomed over the surrounding land like a black dagger thrust out from the bowels of the earth
the evening sun streaked the low hills with shadows long and narrow and far in the west illuminated the surface of leona lake so that the horizon became a rippling bar of gold
to his left eragon heard the steady breathing of his cousin roran who was stretched out beside him
the normally inaudible flow of air seemed preternaturally loud to eragon with his heightened sense of hearing one of many such changes wrought by his experience during the agaeti blodhren the elves blood oath celebration
he paid little attention to that now as he watched a column of people inch toward the base of helgrind apparently having walked from the city of dras leona some miles away
a contingent of twenty four men and women garbed in thick leather robes occupied the head of the column
this group moved with many strange and varied gaits they limped and shuffled and humped and wriggled they swung on crutches or used arms to propel themselves forward on curiously short legs contortions that were necessary because as eragon realized every one of the twenty four lacked an arm or a leg or some combination thereof
their leader sat upright upon a litter borne by six oiled slaves a pose eragon regarded as a rather amazing accomplishment considering that the man or woman he could not tell which consisted of nothing more than a torso and head upon whose brow balanced an ornate leather crest three feet high
the priests of helgrind he murmured to roran
possibly
i dare not explore helgrind with my mind until they leave for if any are magicians they will sense my touch however light and our presence will be revealed
behind the priests trudged a double line of young men swathed in gold cloth
each carried a rectangular metal frame subdivided by twelve horizontal crossbars from which hung iron bells the size of winter rutabagas
half of the young men gave their frames a vigorous shake when they stepped forward with their right foot producing a dolorous cacophony of notes while the other half shook their frames when they advanced upon the left foot causing iron tongues to crash against iron throats and emit a mournful clamor that echoed over the hills
the acolytes accompanied the throbbing of the bells with their own cries groaning and shouting in an ecstasy of passion
at the rear of the grotesque procession trudged a comet is tail of inhabitants from dras leona nobles merchants tradesmen several high ranking military commanders and a motley collection of those less fortunate such as laborers beggars and common foot soldiers
eragon wondered if dras leona is governor marcus tabor was somewhere in their midst
drawing to a stop at the edge of the precipitous mound of scree that ringed helgrind the priests gathered on either side of a rustcolored boulder with a polished top
when the entire column stood motionless before the crude altar the creature upon the litter stirred and began to chant in a voice as discordant as the moaning of the bells
the shaman is declamations were repeatedly truncated by gusts of wind but eragon caught snatches of the ancient language strangely twisted and mispronounced interspersed with dwarf and urgal words all of which were united by an archaic dialect of eragon is own tongue
what he understood caused him to shudder for the sermon spoke of things best left unknown of a malevolent hate that had festered for centuries in the dark caverns of people is hearts before being allowed to flourish in the riders absence of blood and madness and of foul rituals performed underneath a black moon
at the end of that depraved oration two of the lesser priests rushed forward and lifted their master or mistress as the case might be off the litter and onto the face of the altar
