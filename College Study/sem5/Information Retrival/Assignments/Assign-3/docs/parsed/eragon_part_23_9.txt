moss clung to every stone and branch and lined the streams that laced the ground
pools of mud pocked the road where horses had trampled the dirt
before long both brom and eragon were splattered with grime
why is everything green asked eragon
do not they have winter here
yes but the season is mild
mist and fog roll in from the sea and keep everything alive
some find it to their liking but to me it is dreary and depressing
when evening fell they set up camp in the driest spot they could find
as they ate brom commented you should continue to ride cadoc until we reach teirm
it is likely that we will meet other travelers now that we are out of the spine and it will be better if you are with me
an old man traveling alone will raise suspicion
with you at my side no one will ask questions
besides i do not want to show up at the city and have someone who saw me on the trail wondering where you suddenly came from
will we use our own names asked eragon
brom thought about it
we wo not be able to deceive jeod
he already knows my name and i think i trust him with yours
but to everyone else i will be neal and you will be my nephew evan
if our tongues slip and give us away it probably wo not make a difference but i do not want our names in anyone is heads
people have an annoying habit of remembering things they should not
