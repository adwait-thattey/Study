peace peace chided angela with amusement
i know that
if we meet again at the right time i will be sure to tell you about it
but in the meantime you should she stopped speaking as solembum padded between them
the werecat stared at eragon with unblinking eyes
listen closely and i will tell you two things
when the time comes and you need a weapon look under the roots of the menoa tree
then when all seems lost and your power is insufficient go to the rock of kuthian and speak your name to open the vault of souls
before eragon could ask what solembum meant the werecat walked away waving his tail ever so gracefully
angela tilted her head coils of dense hair shadowing her forehead
i do not know what he said and i do not want to know
he spoke to you and only you
do not tell anyone else
i think i have to go said eragon shaken
if you want to said angela smiling again
you are welcome to stay here as long as you like especially if you buy some of my goods
but go if you wish i am sure that we ve given you enough to ponder for a while
** eragon quickly made his way to the door
thank you for reading my ** i think
you re welcome said angela still smiling
eragon exited the shop and stood in the street squinting until his eyes adjusted to the brightness
it was a few minutes before he could think calmly about what he had learned
he started walking his steps unconsciously quickening until he dashed out of teirm feet flying as he headed to saphira is hiding place
he called to her from the base of the cliff
a minute later she soared down and bore him up to the cliff top
when they were both safely on the ground eragon told her about his ** so he concluded i think brom is right i always seem to be where there is trouble
you should remember what the werecat told you
it is important
how do you know he asked curiously
i am not sure but the names he used feel ** she said rolling the word ** we should not forget what he said
do you think i should tell brom
it is your choice but think of this he has no right to know your future
to tell him of solembum and his words will only raise questions you may not want to answer
and if you decided to only ask him what those words mean he will want to know where you learned them
do you think you can lie convincingly to him
no admitted ** i wo not say anything
still this might be too important to hide
they talked until there was nothing more to say
then they sat together companionably watching the trees until dusk
eragon hurried back to teirm and was soon knocking on jeod is door
is neal back he asked the butler
yes sir
i believe he is in the study right now
thank you said eragon
he strode to the room and peeked inside
brom was sitting before the fire smoking
how did it go asked eragon
bloody ** growled brom around his pipe
not that it did any good
thisadministrator of trade is the worst sort of bureaucrat
he abides by every rule delights in making his own whenever it can inconvenience someone and at the same time believes that he is doing good
then he wo not let us see the records asked eragon
no snapped brom exasperated
nothing i could say would sway him
he even refused ** substantial ones too
i did not think i would ever meet a noble who was not corrupt
now that i have i find that i prefer them when they re greedy ** he puffed furiously on his pipe and mumbled a steady stream of curses
when he seemed to have calmed eragon asked tentatively so what now
i am going to take the next week and teach you how to read
a smile split brom is face
after that we re going to give brand a nasty ** eragon pestered him for details but brom refused to say more
dinner was held in a sumptuous dining room
jeod sat at one end of the table a hard eyed helen at the other
brom and eragon were seated between them which eragon felt was a dangerous place to be
empty chairs were on either side of him but he did not mind the space
it helped to protect him from the glares of their hostess
the food was served quietly and jeod and helen wordlessly began eating
eragon followed suit thinking i ve had cheerier meals at funerals
