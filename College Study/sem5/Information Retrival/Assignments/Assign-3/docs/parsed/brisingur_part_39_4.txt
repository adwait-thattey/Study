may you and eragon return to us unharmed
saphira waited while the black blue wolf hair elf created a water shadow ghost of eragon and the apparition walked out of eragon is tent and climbed onto her back
she felt nothing as the insubstantial wraith stepped from her left foreleg to the upper part of her leg and then to her shoulder
when blodhgarm nodded to her indicating the not eragon was in place she lifted her wings until they touched overhead then leaped forward off the end of the stone slab
as saphira fell toward the gray tents below she drove her wings downward propelling herself away from the break bone ground
she turned in the direction of farthen dur and began climbing up to the layer of thin cold air high above where she hoped to find a steady wind to aid her on her journey
she circled over the wooded riverbank where the varden had chosen to stop for the night and wriggled with a fierce joy
no longer did she have to wait while eragon went off adventuring without ** no longer would she have to spend the entire night flying over the same patches of land again and ** and no longer would those who wished to hurt her partner of her mind and heart be able to escape her ** opening her jaws saphira roared her joy and confidence to the world daring whatever gods there might be to challenge her she who was the daughter of iormungr and vervada two of the greatest dragons of their age
when she was more than a mile above the varden and a strong southwestern wind was pressing against her saphira aligned herself with the torrent of air and allowed it to propel her forward soaring over the sun drenched land below
casting her thoughts out before her she said i am on my way little one
