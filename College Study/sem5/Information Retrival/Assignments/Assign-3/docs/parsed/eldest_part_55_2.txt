i will give you however many men you need
the sorceress bowed
as you wish lady nasuada
at a knock on the door the guards drew their swords and positioned themselves on either side of the entranceway then their captain yanked open the door without warning
a young page stood outside a fist raised to knock again
he stared with astonishment at the body on the floor then snapped to attention as the captain asked what is it boy
i have a message for lady nasuada from king orrin
then speak and be quick about it said nasuada
the page took a moment to compose himself
king orrin requests that you attend him directly in his council chambers for he has received reports from the empire that demand your immediate attention
i must attend to this
trianna you have your orders
captain will you leave one of your men to dispose of drail
also please have him locate farica my handmaid
she will see to it that my study is cleaned
and what of me asked elva tilting her head
you said nasuada shall accompany me
that is if you feel strong enough to do so
the girl threw back her head and from her small round mouth emanated a cold laugh
i am strong enough nasuada
are you
ignoring the question nasuada swept forth into the hallway with her guards clustered around her
the stones of the castle exuded an earthy smell in the heat
behind her she heard the patter of elva is footsteps and was perversely pleased that the ghastly child had to hurry to keep pace with the adults longer stride
the guards remained behind in the vestibule to the council chambers while nasuada and elva proceeded inside
the chambers were bare to the point of severity reflecting the militant nature of surda is existence
the country is kings had devoted their resources to protecting their people and overthrowing galbatorix not to decorating borromeo castle with idle riches as the dwarves had done with tronjheim
in the main room lay a rough hewn table twelve feet long upon which a map of alagaesia was staked open with daggers at the four corners
as was custom orrin sat at the head of the table while his various advisers many of whom nasuada knew vehemently opposed her occupied the chairs farther down
the council of elders was also present
nasuada noticed the concern on jormundur is face as he looked at her and deduced that trianna had indeed told him about drail
orrin rose
that i did
we have now he stopped in midword as he noticed elva
ah yes shining brow
i have not had the opportunity to grant you audience before though accounts of your feats have reached my ear and i must confess i have been most curious to meet you
have you found the quarters i arranged for you satisfactory
they are quite nice sire
thank ** at the sound of her eerie voice the voice of an adult everyone at the table flinched
irwin the prime minister bolted upright and pointed a quivering finger at elva
why have you brought this
thisabomination here
you forget your manners sir replied nasuada though she understood his sentiment
orrin frowned
yes do restrain yourself irwin
however his point is valid nasuada we cannot have this child present at our deliberations
the empire she said has just tried to assassinate ** the room echoed with cries of surprise
if it were not for elva is swift action i would be dead
as a result i have taken her into my confidence where i go she ** let them wonder what it is exactly elva can do
this is indeed distressing ** exclaimed the king
have you caught the blackguard responsible
seeing the eager expressions of his advisers nasuada hesitated
it would be best to wait until i can give you an account in private sire
orrin appeared put out by her response but he did not pursue the issue
very well
but sit ** we have just received the most troubling ** after nasuada took her place opposite him elva lurking behind her he continued it seems that our spies in gil ead have been deceived as to the status of galbatorix is army
they believe the army to bein gil ead whereas we have here a missive from one of our men in uru baen who says that he witnessed a great host march south past the capital a week and a half ago
