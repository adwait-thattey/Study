gaining sloan is true name without his consent was a turn of events eragon was unprepared for and uncertain how to deal with
it dawned upon eragon that in order to guess sloan is true name he must understand the butcher better than he did himself for he had not the slightest inkling what his own might be
the realization was an uncomfortable one
he suspected that given the nature of his enemies not knowing everything he could about himself might well prove fatal
he vowed then to devote more time to introspection and to uncovering his true name
perhaps oromis and glaedr could tell me what it is he thought
whatever the doubts and confusion sloan is true name roused within him it gave eragon the beginning of an idea for how to deal with the butcher
even once he had the basic concept it still took him another ten minutes to thrash out the rest of his plan and make sure that it would work in the manner he intended
sloan tilted his head in eragon is direction as eragon rose and walked out of their camp into the starlit land beyond
where are you going asked sloan
he wandered through the wilderness until he found a low broad rock covered with scabs of lichen and with a bowl like hollow in the middle
adurna risa said he
around the rock countless minuscule droplets of water filtered up through the soil and coalesced into flawless silver tubes that arched over the edge of the rock and down into the hollow
when the water started to overflow and return to the earth only to be again ensnared by his spell eragon released the flow of magic
he waited until the surface of the water became perfectly still so that it acted like a mirror and he stood before what looked like a basin of stars and then he said draumr kopa and many other words besides reciting a spell that would allow him to not only see but speak with others at a distance
oromis had taught him the variation on scrying two days before he and saphira had left ellesmera for surda
the water went completely black as if someone had extinguished the stars like candles
a moment or two later an oval shape brightened in the middle of the water and eragon beheld the interior of a large white tent illuminated by the flameless light from a red erisdar one of the elves magical lanterns
normally eragon would be unable to scry a person or place he had not seen before but the elves seeing glass was enchanted to transmit an image of its surroundings to anyone who contacted the glass
likewise eragon is spell would project an image of himself and his surroundings onto the surface of the glass
the arrangement allowed strangers to contact each other from any location in the world which was an invaluable ability in times of war
a tall elf with silver hair and battle worn armor entered eragon is field of vision and he recognized lord dathedr who advised queen islanzadi and was a friend of arya is
if dathedr was surprised to see eragon he did not show it he inclined his head touched the first two fingers of his right hand to his lips and said in his lilting voice atra esterni ono thelduin eragon shur tugal
mentally making the shift to conversing in the ancient language eragon duplicated the gesture with his fingers and replied atra du evarinya ono varda dathedr vodhr
continuing in his native tongue dathedr said i am glad to know you are well shadeslayer
arya drottningu informed us of your mission some days ago and we have been much concerned on your behalf and saphira is
i trust nothing has gone amiss
no but i encountered an unforeseen problem and if i may i would consult with queen islanzadi and seek her wisdom in this matter
dathedr is catlike eyes drifted nearly shut becoming two angled slashes that gave him a fierce and unreadable expression
i know you would not ask this unless it is important eragon vodhr but beware a drawn bow may just as easily snap and injure the archer as it may send the arrow flying
if it so please you wait and i shall inquire after the queen
i shall wait
your assistance is most welcome dathedr ** as the elf turned away from the seeing glass eragon grimaced
