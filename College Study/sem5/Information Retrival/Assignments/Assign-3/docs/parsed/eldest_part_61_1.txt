eragon coughed as saphira descended through the layers of smoke angling toward the jiet river which was hidden behind the haze
he blinked and wiped back tears
the fumes made his eyes smart
closer to the ground the air cleared giving eragon an unobstructed view of their destination
the rippling veil of black and crimson smoke filtered the sun is rays in such a way that everything below was bathed in a lurid orange
occasional rents in the besmirched sky allowed pale bars of light to strike the ground where they remained like pillars of translucent glass until they were truncated by the shifting clouds
the jiet river lay before them as thick and turgid as a gorged snake its crosshatched surface reflecting the same ghastly hue that pervaded the burning plains
even when a splotch of undiluted light happened to fall upon the river the water appeared chalky white opaque and opalescent almost as if it were the milk of some fearsome beast and seemed to glow with an eerie luminescence all its own
two armies were arrayed along the eastern banks of the oozing waterway
to the south were the varden and the men of surda entrenched behind multiple layers of defense where they displayed a fine panoply of woven standards ranks of proud tents and the picketed horses of king orrin is cavalry
strong as they were their numbers paled in comparison to the size of the force assembled in the north
galbatorix is army was so large it measured three miles across on its leading edge and how many in length it was impossible to tell for the individual men melded into a shadowy mass in the distance
between the mortal foes was an empty span of perhaps two miles
this land and the land that the armies camped on was pocked with countless ragged orifices in which danced green tongues of fire
from those sickly torches billowed plumes of smoke that dimmed the sun
every scrap of vegetation had been scorched from the parched soil except for growths of black orange and chartreuse lichen that from the air gave the earth a scabbed and infected appearance
it was the most forbidding vista eragon had clapped eyes upon
saphira emerged over the no man is land that separated the grim armies and now she twisted and dove toward the varden as fast as she dared for so long as they remained exposed to the empire they were vulnerable to attacks from enemy magicians
eragon extended his awareness as far as he could in every direction hunting for hostile minds that could feel his probing touch and would react to it the minds of magicians and those trained to fend off magicians
what he felt instead was the sudden panic that overwhelmed the varden is sentinels many of whom he realized had never before seen saphira
fear made them ignore their common sense and they released a flock of barbed arrows that arched up to intercept her
raising his right hand eragon cried letta orya ** the arrows froze in place
with a flick of his wrist and the word ganga he redirected them sending the darts boring toward the no man is land where they could bury themselves in the barren soil without causing harm
he missed one arrow though which was fired a few seconds after the first volley
eragon leaned as far to his right as he could and faster than any normal human plucked the arrow from the air as saphira flew past it
only a hundred feet above the ground saphira flared her wings to slow her steep descent before alighting first on her hind legs and then her front legs as she came to a running stop among the varden is tents
werg growled orik loosening the thongs that held his legs in place
i d rather fight a dozen kull than experience such a fall ** he let himself hang off one side of the saddle then dropped to saphira is foreleg below and from there to the ground
even as eragon dismounted dozens of warriors with awestruck expressions gathered around saphira
from within their midst strode a big bear of a man whom eragon recognized fredric the varden is weapon master from farthen dur still garbed in his hairy ox hide armor
come on you slack jawed ** roared fredric
