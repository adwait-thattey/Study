master wo not you join me
a sad smile graced oromis is face
not today eragon
the spells required by the blood oath celebration exacted a heavy toll from me
that and my
condition
it took the last of my strength to come sit outside
i am sorry ** does he resent that the dragons did not choose to heal him as well wondered eragon
he immediately discounted the thought oromis would never be so petty
do not be
it is no fault of yours that i am crippled
as eragon struggled to complete the third level of the rimgar it became obvious that he still lacked the elves balance and flexibility two attributes that even the elves had to work to acquire
in a way he welcomed those limitations for if he was perfect what was left for him to accomplish
the following weeks were difficult for eragon
on one hand he made enormous progress with his training mastering subject after subject that had once confounded him
he still found oromis is lessons challenging but he no longer felt as if he were drowning in a sea of his own inadequacy
it was easier for eragon to read and write and his increased strength meant that he could now cast elven spells that required so much energy they would kill any normal human
his strength also made him aware of how weak oromis was compared to other elves
and yet despite those accomplishments eragon experienced a growing sense of discontent
no matter how hard he tried to forget arya every day that passed increased his yearning an agony made worse by knowing that she did not want to see or talk with him
but more than that it seemed to him as if an ominous storm was gathering beyond the edge of the horizon a storm that threatened to break at any moment and sweep across the land devastating everything in its path
saphira shared his unease
she said the world is stretched thin eragon
soon it will snap and madness will burst forth
what you feel is what we dragons feel and what the elves feel the inexorable march of grim fate as the end of our age approaches
weep for those who will die in the chaos that shall consume alagaesia
and hope that we may win a brighter future by the strength of your sword and shield and my fangs and talons
