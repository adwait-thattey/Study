closing her eyes arya sighed and shook her head
no
it was some dark magic of durza is invention
he gloated about it when i was in gil ead
i do not know how you managed to resist him for so long
i saw what he did to you
it
it was not easy
i viewed the torments he inflicted on me as a test of my commitment as a chance to demonstrate that i had not made a mistake and i was indeed worthy of the yawe symbol
as such i welcomed the ordeal
but still even elves are not immune to pain
it is amazing you could keep the location of ellesmera hidden from him all those months
a touch of pride colored her voice
not just the location of ellesmera but also where i had sent saphira is egg my vocabulary in the ancient language and everything else that might be of use to galbatorix
the conversation lapsed and then eragon said do you think about it much what you went through in gil ead when she did not respond he added you never talk about it
you recount the facts of your imprisonment readily enough but you never mention what it was like for you nor how you feel about it now
pain is pain she said
it needs no description
true but ignoring it can cause more harm than the original injury
no one can live through something like that and escape unscathed
not on the inside at least
why do you assume i have not already confided in someone
does it matter ajihad my mother a friend in ellesmera
perhaps i am wrong he said but you do not seem that close to anyone
where you walk you walk alone even among your own people
arya is countenance remained impassive
her lack of expression was so complete eragon began to wonder if she would deign to respond a doubt that had just transformed into conviction when she whispered it was not always so
alert eragon waited without moving afraid that whatever he might do would stop her from saying more
once i had someone to talk to someone who understood what i was and where i came from
once
he was older than i but we were kindred spirits both curious about the world outside our forest eager to explore and eager to strike against galbatorix
neither of us could bear to stay in du weldenvarden studying working magic pursuing our own personal projects when we knew the dragon killer the bane of the riders was searching for a way to conquer our race
he came to that conclusion later than i decades after i assumed my position as ambassador and a few years before hefring stole saphira is egg but the moment he did he volunteered to accompany me wherever islanzadi is orders might take ** she blinked and her throat convulsed
i was not going to let him but the queen liked the idea and he was so very convincing
she pursed her lips and blinked again her eyes brighter than normal
as gently as he could eragon asked was it faolin
yes she said releasing the confirmation almost as a gasp
casting back her head arya gazed up at the twinkling sky her long neck gold with firelight her face pale with the radiance of the heavens
do you ask out of friendly concern or your own selfinterest she gave an abrupt choked laugh the sound of water falling over cold rocks
never mind
the night air has addled me
it has undone my sense of courtesy and left me free to say the most spiteful things that occur to me
it does matter because i regret it and i shall not tolerate it
did i love faolin how would you define love for over twenty years we traveled together the only immortals to walk among the short lived races
we were companions
and friends
a pang of jealousy afflicted eragon
he wrestled with it subdued it and tried to eliminate it but was not altogether successful
a slight remnant of the feeling continued to aggravate him like a splinter burrowing underneath his skin
over twenty years repeated arya
persisting in her survey of the constellations she rocked back and forth seemingly oblivious to eragon
and then in a single instant durza tore that away from me
faolin and glenwing were the first elves to die in combat for nearly a century
when i saw faolin fall i understood then that the true agony of war is not being wounded yourself it is having to watch those you care about being hurt
