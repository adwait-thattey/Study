turning around he lumbered toward the bar with his friends
keeping his gaze fixed upon the crowd eragon slipped behind the table and sat next to arya
what are you doing here he asked barely moving his lips
surprised he glanced at her and she raised a curved eyebrow
he looked back at the throng of people and pretending to smile asked are you alone
no longer
did you rent a bed for the night
good
i already have a room
we can talk there
they rose in unison and he followed her to the stairs at the back of the common room
the worn treads creaked under their feet as they climbed to a hallway on the second story
a single candle illuminated the dingy wood paneled corridor
arya led the way to the last door on the right and from within the voluminous sleeve of her cloak she produced an iron key
unlocking the door she entered the room waited for eragon to cross the threshold after her and then closed and secured the door again
a faint orange glow penetrated the lead lined window across from eragon
the glow came from a lantern hanging on the other side of eastcroft is town square
by it he was able to make out the shape of an oil lamp on a low table to his right
brisingr whispered eragon and lit the wick with a spark from his finger
even with the lamp burning the room was still dark
the chamber contained the same paneling as the hallway and the chestnutcolored wood absorbed most of the light that struck it and made the room seem small and heavy as if a great weight pressed inward
aside from the table the only other piece of furniture was a narrow bed with a single blanket thrown over the ticking
a small bag of supplies rested on the mattress
eragon and arya stood facing each other
then eragon reached up and removed the cloth strip tied around his head and arya unfastened the brooch that held her cloak around her shoulders and placed the garment on the bed
she wore a forest green dress the first dress eragon had seen her in
it was a strange experience for eragon to have their appearances reversed so that he was the one who looked like an elf and arya a human
the change did nothing to diminish his regard for her but it did make him more comfortable in her presence for she was less alien to him now
it was arya who broke the silence
saphira said you stayed behind to kill the last ra zac and to explore the rest of helgrind
is that the truth
and what is the whole truth
eragon knew that nothing less would satisfy her
promise me that you wo not share what i am about to tell you with anyone unless i give you permission
i promise she said in the ancient language
then he told her about finding sloan why he decided not to bring him back to the varden the curse he had laid upon the butcher and the chance he had given sloan to redeem himself at least partially and to regain his sight
eragon finished by saying whatever happens roran and katrina can never learn that sloan is still alive
if they do there will be no end of trouble
arya sat on the edge of the bed and for a long while stared at the lamp and its jumping flame
then you should have killed him
just because you find your task distasteful is no reason to shirk it
you were a coward
eragon bridled at her accusation
was i anyone with a knife could have killed sloan
what i did was far harder
i did not kill him because i thought it was ** eragon frowned with concentration as he searched for the words to explain himself
i was not afraid
not that
not after going into battle
it was something else
i will kill in war
but i wo not take it upon myself to decide who lives and who dies
i do not have the experience or the wisdom
every man has a line he wo not cross arya and i found mine when i looked upon sloan
even if i had galbatorix as my captive i would not kill him
i would take him to nasuada and king orrin and if they condemned him to death then i would happily lop off his head but not before
call it weakness if you will but that is how i am made and i wo not apologize for it
you will be a tool then wielded by others
i will serve the people as best i can
i ve never aspired to lead
