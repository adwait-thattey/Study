the air grew so hot that eragon was forced to turn away
he felt the insects underneath the rocks being crisped in the inferno
after a minute saphira clapped shut her jaws leaving a circle of stones five feet across glowing cherry red
thank you eragon said to her
he hunched by the edge of the scorched rocks and warmed his hands over them
remember saphira to use your tongue to direct the stream admonished **
it took nine years for the elves wisest magicians to devise the needed spell
when they had they and the dragons gathered together at ilirea
the elves provided the structure of the enchantment the dragons provided the strength and together they melded the souls of elves and dragons
the joining changed us
we dragons gained the use of language and other trappings of civilization while the elves shared in our longevity since before that moment their lives were as short as humans
in the end the elves were the most affected
our magic dragons magic which permeates every fiber of our being was transmitted to the elves and in time gave them their much vaunted strength and grace
humans have never been influenced as strongly since you were added to the spell after its completion and it has not had as much time to work upon you as with the elves
still and here glaedr is eye gleamed it has already gentled your race from the rough barbarians who first landed in alagaesia though you have begun to regress since the fall
were dwarves ever part of this spell asked eragon
no and that is why there has never been a dwarf rider
they do not care for dragons nor we for them and they found the idea of being joined with us repellent
perhaps it is fortunate that they did not enter into our pact for they have escaped the decline of humans and elves
decline master queried saphira in what eragon would have sworn was a teasing tone of voice
aye decline
if one or another of our three races suffer so do they all
by killing dragons galbatorix harmed his own race as well as the elves
the two of you have not seen this for you are new to ellesmera but the elves are on the wane their power is not what it once was
and humans have lost much of their culture and been consumed by chaos and corruption
only by righting the imbalance between our three races shall order return to the world
the old dragon kneaded the scree with his talons crumbling it into gravel so that he was more ** within the enchantment queen tarmunora oversaw was the mechanism that allows a hatchling to be linked with his or her rider
when a dragon decides to give an egg to the riders certain words are said over the egg which i shall teach you later that prevent the dragon inside from hatching until it is brought into contact with the person with whom it decides to bond
as dragons can remain in their eggs indefinitely time is of no concern nor is the infant harmed
you yourself are an example of this saphira
the bond that forms between a rider and dragon is but an enhanced version of the bond that already exists between our races
the human or elf becomes stronger and fairer while some of the dragon is fiercer traits are tempered by a more reasoned outlook
i see a thought biting at your tongue eragon
what is it
it is just
he hesitated
i have a hard time imagining you or saphira being any fiercer
not he added anxiously that that is a bad thing
the ground shook as if with an avalanche as glaedr chuckled rolling his great big staring eye behind its horny lid and back ** ever you met an unbonded dragon you would not say so
a dragon alone answers to no one and no thing takes whatever pleases it and bears no thought of kindness for aught but its kith and kin
fierce and proud were the wild dragons even arrogant
the females were so formidable it was accounted a great accomplishment among the riders dragons to mate with one
the lack of this bond is why galbatorix is partnership with shruikan his second dragon is such a perverted union
shruikan did not choose galbatorix as his partner he was twisted by certain black magics into serving galbatorix is madness
