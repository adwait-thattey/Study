but only if he could guess your new names
he is most adept at the ** murtagh raised zar roc off the saddle
we may make use of your suggestion in the future but only after careful study and preparation so that thorn and i do not regain our freedom only to have galbatorix steal it back from us directly ** he hefted zar roc the sword is iridescent blade shimmering
therefore we have no choice but to take you with us to uru baen
will you go peacefully
unable to contain himself any longer eragon said i would sooner tear out my own **
better to tear out my hearts murtagh replied then stabbed zar roc overhead and shouted a wild war cry
roaring in unison thorn flapped twice fast to climb above saphira
he twisted in a half circle as he rose so his head would be over saphira is neck where he could immobilize her with a single bite at the base of her skull
saphira did not wait for him
she tipped forward rotating her wings in their shoulder sockets so that for the span of a heartbeat she pointed straight down her wings still parallel with the dustsmeared ground supporting her entire unstable weight
then she pulled in her right wing and swung her head to the left and her tail to the right spinning in a clockwise direction
her muscular tail struck thorn across his left side just as he sailed over her breaking his wing in five separate places
the jagged ends of thorn is hollow flight bones pierced his hide and stuck out between his flashing scales
globules of steaming dragon blood rained down upon eragon and saphira
a droplet splashed against the back of eragon is coif and seeped through the mail to his bare skin
it burned like hot oil
he scrabbled at his neck trying to wipe off the blood
his roar converting into a whine of pain thorn tumbled past saphira unable to stay aloft
well ** eragon shouted to saphira as she righted herself
eragon watched from above as murtagh removed a small round object from his belt and pressed it against thorn is shoulder
eragon sensed no surge of magic from murtagh but the object in his hand flared and thorn is broken wing jerked as his bones snapped back in place and muscles and tendons rippled and the tears in them vanished
lastly the wounds in thorn is hide sealed over
how did he do that eragon exclaimed
arya answered he must have imbued the item with a spell of healing beforehand
we should have thought of that ourselves
his injuries mended thorn halted his fall and began to ascend toward saphira with prodigious speed searing the air in front of him with a boiling spear of sullen red fire
saphira dove at him spiraling around the tower of flame
she snapped at thorn is neck causing him to shy away and raked his shoulders and chest with her front claws and buffeted him with her huge wings
the edge of her right wing clipped murtagh knocking him sideways in his saddle
he recovered quickly and slashed at saphira opening up a three foot rent in the membrane of her wing
hissing saphira kicked thorn away with her hind legs and released a jet of fire which split and passed harmlessly on either side of thorn
eragon felt through saphira the throbbing of her wound
he stared at the bloody gash thoughts racing
if they had been fighting any magician besides murtagh he would not dare to cast a spell while engaged in hostilities for the magician would most likely believe he or she was about to die and would counter with a desperate all out magical attack
it was different with murtagh
eragon knew galbatorix had ordered murtagh to capture not kill him and saphira
no matter what i do eragon thought he will not attempt to slay me
it was safe then eragon decided to heal saphira
and he belatedly realized he could attack murtagh with any spells he desired and murtagh would not be able to respond with deadly force
but he wondered why murtagh had used an enchanted object to cure thorn is hurts instead of casting the spell himself
saphira said perhaps he wants to preserve his strength
or perhaps he wanted to avoid frightening you
it would not please galbatorix if by using magic murtagh caused you to panic and you killed yourself or thorn or murtagh as a result
