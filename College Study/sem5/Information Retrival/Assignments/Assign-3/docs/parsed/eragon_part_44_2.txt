when you wake do not speak of me to anyone said the figure kindly face obscured by a silver nimbus
remember you must go to the elves
now sleep
he raised a hand as if in benediction and peace crept through eragon
his last thought was that brom would have been proud of him
wake commanded the voice
awake eragon for you have slept far too ** he stirred unwillingly loath to listen
the warmth that surrounded him was too comfortable to leave
the voice sounded again
rise ** you are **
he reluctantly forced his eyes open and found himself on a long bed swathed in soft blankets
angela sat in a chair beside him staring at his face intently
how do you feel she asked
disoriented and confused he let his eyes roam over the small room
i
i do not know he said his mouth dry and sore
then do not move
you should conserve your strength said angela running a hand through her curly hair
eragon saw that she still wore her flanged armor
why was that a fit of coughing made him dizzy lightheaded and ache all over
his feverish limbs felt heavy
angela lifted a gilt horn from the floor and held it to his lips
here drink
cool mead ran down his throat refreshing him
warmth bloomed in his stomach and rose to his cheeks
he coughed again which worsened his throbbing head
how did i get here there was a battle
we were losing
then durza and
** he exclaimed sitting upright
he sagged back as his head swam and clenched his eyes feeling sick
what about saphira is she all right the urgals were winning
she was falling
and **
they lived assured angela and have been waiting for you to wake
do you wish to see them he nodded feebly
angela got up and threw open the door
arya and murtagh filed inside
saphira snaked her head into the room after them her body too big to fit through the doorway
her chest vibrated as she hummed deeply eyes sparkling
smiling eragon touched her thoughts with relief and ** is good to see you well little one she said tenderly
the others want to explain it so i will let them
he smiled weakly still confused then looked at arya and murtagh
both of them were bandaged arya on her arm murtagh around his head
murtagh grinned widely
about time you were up
we ve been sitting in the hall for hours
what
what happened asked eragon
arya looked sad
but murtagh crowed we ** it was ** when the shade is spirits if that is what they were flew across farthen dur the urgals ceased fighting to watch them go
it was as though they were released from a spell then because their clans suddenly turned and attacked each other
their entire army disintegrated within minutes
we routed them after **
murtagh shook his head
no many of them escaped into the tunnels
the varden and dwarves are busy ferreting them out right now but it is going to take a while
i was helping until an urgal banged me on the head and i was sent back here
they are not going to lock you up again
his face grew sober
no one really cares about that right now
a lot of varden and dwarves were killed the survivors are busy trying to recover from the battle
but at least you have cause to be happy
you re a ** everyone is talking about how you killed durza
if it had not been for you we would have lost
eragon was troubled by his words but pushed them away for later consideration
where were the twins they were not where they were supposed to be i could not contact them
i needed their help
murtagh shrugged
i was told they bravely fought off a group of urgals that broke into tronjheim somewhere else
they were probably too busy to talk with you
that seemed wrong for some reason but eragon could not decide why
he turned to arya
her large bright eyes had been fixed upon him the entire time
how come you did not crash you and saphira were
his voice trailed off
she said slowly when you warned saphira of durza i was still trying to remove her damaged armor
by the time it was off it was too late to slide down vol turin you would have been captured before i reached the bottom
besides durza would have killed you before letting me rescue ** regret entered her voice so i did the one thing i could to distract him i broke the star sapphire
