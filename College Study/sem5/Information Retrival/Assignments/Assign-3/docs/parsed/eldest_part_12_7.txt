no sign existed of where it had been rent when durza cut eragon is back
the coif gloves bracers greaves and helmet were likewise repaired
our greatest smiths worked on these said orik as well as your armor saphira
however since we can not take dragon armor with us it was given to the varden who will guard it against our return
please thank him for me said saphira
eragon obliged then laced on the greaves and bracers storing the other items in his bags
last of all he reached for his helm only to find orik holding it
the dwarf rolled the piece between his hands then said do not be so quick to don this eragon
there is a choice you must make first
raising the helmet orik uncovered its polished brow which eragon now saw had been altered etched in the steel were the hammer and stars of hrothgar and orik is clan the ingeitum
orik scowled looking both pleased and troubled and said in a formal voice mine king hrothgar desires that i present this helm as a symbol of the friendship he bears for you
and with it hrothgar extends an offer to adopt you as one of durgrimst ingeitum as a member of his own family
eragon stared at the helm amazed that hrothgar would make such a ** this mean i d be subjected to his rule
if i continue to accrue loyalties and allegiances at this pace i will be incapacitated before long unable to do anything without breaking some oath
you do not have to put it on pointed out saphira
and risk insulting hrothgar once again we re trapped
it may be intended as a gift though another sign of otho not a trap
i would guess he is thanking us for my offer to repair isidar mithrim
that had not occurred to eragon for he had been too busy trying to figure out how the dwarf king might gain advantage over **
but i think it is also an attempt to correct the imbalance of power created when i swore fealty to nasuada
the dwarves could not have been pleased with that turn of events
he looked back at orik who was waiting anxiously
how often has this been done
for a human never
hrothgar argued with the ingeitum families for a day and a night before they agreed to accept you
if you consent to bear our crest you will have full rights as clan member
you may attend our councils and give voice on every issue
and he grew very somber if you so wish you will have the right to be buried with our dead
for the first time the enormity of hrothgar is action struck eragon
the dwarves could offer no higher honor
with a swift motion he took the helm from orik and pressed it down upon his head
i am privileged to join durgrimst ingeitum
orik nodded with approval and said then take this knurlnien this heart of stone and cup it between your hands yes like so
you must steel yourself now and prick open a vein to wet the stone
a few drops will suffice
to finish repeat after me os il dom qiranu carn dur thargen zeitmen oen grimst vor formv edaris rak skilfz
narho is belgond
it was a lengthy recitation and all the longer because orik stopped to translate every few sentences
afterward eragon healed his wrist with a quick spell
whatever else the clans may say about this business observed orik you have behaved with integrity and respect
they cannot ignore ** he grinned
we are of the same clan now eh you are my foster ** under more normal circumstances hrothgar would have presented your helm himself and we would have held a lengthy ceremony to commemorate your induction into durgrimst ingeitum but events move too swiftly for us to tarry
fear not that you are being slighted ** your adoption shall be celebrated with the proper rituals when you and saphira next return to farthen dur
you shall feast and dance and have many pieces of paper to sign in order to formalize your new position
i look forward to the day said eragon
he was still preoccupied with sifting through the numerous possible ramifications of belonging to durgrimst ingeitum
sitting against a pillar orik shrugged off his pack and drew his ax which he proceeded to twirl between his palms
after several minutes he leaned forward glaring back into tronjheim
barzul ** where are they arya said she would be right here
