might not even have to fight his men
did i really expect that someone else would do my job for me nasuada asked ** led us into this blind and i have to lead us out
intending to cut open a seam she extended her arm and snagged the tip of her knife on a fringe of bobbin lace slicing it in half
she stared at the ragged wound in the lace at the frayed ends of the parchment colored strands that wriggled across the overgown like so many contorted worms stared and felt a hysterical laugh claw at her throat even as a tear formed in her eye
could her luck be any worse
the bobbin lace was the most valuable part of the dress
even though lace required skill to make its rarity and expense were mainly due to its central ingredient vast copious mind numbing and deadening amounts of time
it took so long to produce that if you attempted to create a lace veil by yourself your progress would be measured not in weeks but in months
ounce for ounce lace was worth more than gold or silver
she ran her fingers over the band of threads pausing on the rift that she had ** is not as if lace takes that much energy just time
she hated making it **
energy
at that moment a series of images flashed through her mind orrin talking about using magic for research trianna the woman who had helmed du vrangr gata since the twins deaths looking up at one of the varden is healers while he explained the principles of magic to nasuada when she was only five or six years old
the disparate experiences formed a chain of reasoning that was so outrageous and unlikely it finally released the laugh imprisoned in her throat
farica gave her an odd look and waited for an explanation
standing nasuada tumbled half the overgown off her lap and onto the floor
fetch me trianna this instant she said
i do not care what she is doing bring her here
the skin around farica is eyes tightened but she curtsied and said as you wish ma ** she departed through the hidden servants door
thank you nasuada whispered in the empty room
she understood her maid is reluctance she too felt uncomfortable whenever she had to interact with magic users
indeed she only trusted eragon because he was a rider although that was no proof of virtue as galbatorix had shown and because of his oath of fealty which nasuada knew he would never break
it scared her to consider magicians and sorcerers powers
the thought that a seemingly ordinary person could kill with a word invade your mind if he or she wished cheat lie and steal without being caught and otherwise defy society with near impunity
how did you enforce the law when a certain segment of the population possessed special powers at its most basic level the varden is war against the empire was nothing more than an attempt to bring to justice a man who had abused his magical abilities and to prevent him from committing further ** this pain and destruction because no one had the strength to defeat galbatorix
he wo not even die after a normal span of years
although she disliked magic she knew that it would play a crucial role in removing galbatorix and that she could not afford to alienate its practitioners until victory was assured
once that occurred she intended to resolve the problem that they presented
a brazen knock on her chamber door disturbed her thoughts
fixing a pleasant smile on her face and guarding her mind as she had been trained nasuada said ** it was important that she appear polite after summoning trianna in such a rude manner
the door thrust open and the brunette sorceress strode into the room her tousled locks piled high above her head with obvious haste
she looked as if she had just been roused from bed
bowing in the dwarven fashion she said you asked for me lady
i ** relaxing into a chair nasuada let her gaze slowly drift up and down trianna
the sorceress lifted her chin under nasuada is examination
i need to know what is the most important rule of magic
trianna frowned
that whatever you do with magic requires the same amount of energy as it would to do otherwise
and what youcan do is only limited by your ingenuity and by your knowledge of the ancient language
