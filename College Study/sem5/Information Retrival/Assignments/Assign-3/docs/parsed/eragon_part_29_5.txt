but we will go easier now
it is not as important if we miss a night here or ** he wiped his brow
just remember if you ever have the misfortune to fight an elf trained or not female or male expect to lose
they along with dragons and other creatures of magic are many times stronger than nature intended
even the weakest elf could easily overpower you
the same goes for the ra zac they are not human and tire much more slowly than we do
is there any way to become their equal asked eragon
he sat cross legged by saphira
you fought well she said
he smiled
brom seated himself with a shrug
there are a few but none are available to you now
magic will let you defeat all but the strongest enemies
for those you will need saphira is help plus a great deal of luck
remember when creatures of magic actually use magic they can accomplish things that could kill a human because of their enhanced abilities
how do you fight with magic asked eragon
well he said leaning on an elbow
suppose i was attacked by a shade
how could i block his magic most spells take place instantaneously which makes it impossible to react in time
and even if i could how would i nullify an enemy is magic it seems i would have to know my opponent is intentionbefore he ** he paused
i just do not see how it can be done
whoever attacked first would win
brom sighed
what you are talking about a wizards duel if you will is extremely dangerous
have not you ever wondered how galbatorix was able to defeat all of the riders with the help of only a dozen or so traitors
i never thought about it acknowledged eragon
there are several ways
some you will learn about later but the main one is that galbatorix was and still is a master of breaking into people is minds
you see in a wizards duel there are strict rules that each side must observe or else both contestants will die
to begin with no one uses magic until one of the participants gains access to the other is mind
saphira curled her tail comfortably around eragon and asked why wait by the time an enemy realizes that you ve attacked it will be too late for him to act
eragon repeated the question out loud
brom shook his head
no it wo not
if i were to suddenly use my power against you eragon you would surely die but in the brief moment before you were destroyed there would be time for a counterattack
therefore unless one combatant has a death wish neither side attacks until one of them has breached the other is defenses
brom shrugged and said once you re inside your enemy is mind it is easy enough to anticipate what he will do and prevent it
even with that advantage it is still possible to lose if you do not know how to counteract spells
he filled and lit his pipe
and that requires extraordinarily quick thinking
before you can defend yourself you have to understand the exact nature of the forces directed at you
if you re being attacked with heat you have to know whether it is being conveyed to you through air fire light or some other medium
only once that is known can you combat the magic by for instance chilling the heated material
extremely confirmed brom
a plume of smoke rose from his pipe
seldom can people survive such a duel for more than a few seconds
the enormous amount of effort and skill required condemns anyone without the proper training to a quick death
once you ve progressed i will start teaching you the necessary methods
in the meantime if you ever find yourself facing a wizards duel i suggest you run away as fast as you can
they lunched at fasaloft a bustling lakeside village
it was a charming place set on a rise overlooking the lake
as they ate in the hostel is common room eragon listened intently to the gossip and was relieved to hear no rumors of him and saphira
the trail now a road had grown steadily worse over the past two days
wagon wheels and iron shod hooves had conspired to tear up the ground making many sections impassable
an increase in travelers forced saphira to hide during the day and then catch up with brom and eragon at night
for days they continued south along leona lake is vast shore
