still he could not help being pleased by his heightened prowess as well as by his long awaited reprieve from the torment of his back
without the constant bursts of pain it was as if a haze had been lifted from his mind allowing him to think clearly once again
a few minutes remained before they were supposed to meet with oromis and glaedr so eragon took his bow and quiver from where they hung on saphira is back and walked to the range where elves practiced archery
since the elves bows were much more powerful than his their padded targets were both too small and too far away for him
he had to shoot from halfway down the range
taking his place eragon nocked an arrow and slowly pulled back the string delighted by how easy it had become
he aimed released the arrow and held his position waiting to see if he would hit his mark
like a maddened hornet the dart buzzed toward the target and buried itself in the center
he grinned
again and again he fired at the target his speed increasing with his confidence until he loosed thirty arrows in a minute
at the thirty first arrow he pulled on the string slightly harder than he had ever done or was capable of doing before
with an explosive report the yew bow broke in half underneath his left hand scratching his fingers and discharging a burst of splinters from the back of the bow
his hand went numb from the jolt
eragon stared at the remains of his weapon dismayed by the loss
garrow had made it as a birthday present for him over three years ago
since then hardly a week went by when eragon had not used his bow
it had helped him to provide food for his family on numerous occasions when they would have otherwise gone hungry
with it he had killed his first deer
with it he had killed his first urgal
and through it he had first used magic
losing his bow was like losing an old friend who could be relied upon in even the worst situation
saphira sniffed the two pieces of wood dangling from his grip and said it seems you need a new stick thrower
he grunted in no mood to talk and stomped out to retrieve his arrows
from the open field he and saphira flew to the white crags of tel naeir and presented themselves to oromis who was seated on a stool in front of his hut gazing out over the cliff with his farseeing eyes
he said have you entirely recovered eragon from the potent magic of the blood oath celebration
a long silence followed as oromis drank from a cup of blackberry tea and resumed contemplating the ancient forest
eragon waited without complaint he was used to such pauses when dealing with the old rider
at length oromis said glaedr explained to me as best he could what was done to you during the celebration
such a thing has never before occurred in the history of the riders
once again the dragons have proved themselves capable of far more than we ** he sipped his tea
glaedr was uncertain exactly what changes you would experience so i would like you to describe the full extent of your transformation including your appearance
eragon quickly summarized how he had been altered detailing the increased sensitivity of his sight smell hearing and touch and ending with an account of his clash with vanir
and how asked oromis do you feel about this do you resent that your body was manipulated without your permission
no ** not at all
i might have resented it before the battle of farthen dur but now i am just grateful that my back does not hurt anymore
i would have willingly submitted myself to far greater changes in order to escape durza is curse
no my only response is gratitude
oromis nodded
i am glad that you are wise enough to take that position for your gift is worth more than all the gold in the world
with it i believe that our feet are at last set upon the correct ** again he sipped his tea
let us proceed
saphira glaedr expects you at the stone of broken eggs
eragon you will begin today with the third level of rimgar if you can
i would know everything you are capable of
eragon started toward the square of tamped earth where they usually performed the dance of snake and crane then hesitated when the silver haired elf remained behind
