remember the king is great ambition is to have all four of us under his command not dead where we are beyond his reach
that must be it eragon agreed
as he prepared to mend saphira is wing arya said wait
do not
what why ca not you feel saphira is pain
let my brethren and i tend to her
it will confuse murtagh and this way the effort shall not weaken you
are not you too far away to work such a change
not when the lot of us pool our resources
and eragon we recommend you refrain from striking at murtagh with magic until he attacks with mind or magic himself
he may yet be stronger than you even with the thirteen of us lending our strength
we do not know
it is better not to test yourself against him until there is no other alternative
all of alagaesia will fall to galbatorix
eragon sensed arya concentrating then the cut in saphira is wing ceased weeping tears of blood and the raw edges of the delicate cerulean membrane flowed together without a scab or a scar
saphira is relief was palpable
with a tinge of fatigue arya said guard yourself better if you can
this was not easy
after saphira had kicked him thorn flailed and lost altitude
he must have assumed that saphira meant to harry him downward where it would be harder for him to evade her attacks because he fled west a quarter of a mile
when he finally noticed that saphira was not pursuing him he circled up and around until he was a good thousand feet higher than she was
drawing in his wings thorn hurtled toward saphira flames flickering in his open maw his ivory talons outstretched murtagh brandishing zar roc on his back
eragon nearly lost his grip on the falchion as saphira folded one wing and flipped upside down with a dizzying wrench then extended the wing again to slow her descent
if he craned his head backward eragon could see the ground below them
or was it above them he gritted his teeth and concentrated on maintaining his hold on the saddle
thorn and saphira collided and to eragon it was as if saphira had crashed into the side of a mountain
the force of the impact drove him forward and he banged his helmet against the neck spike in front of him denting the thick steel
dazed he hung loose from the saddle and watched as the disks of the heavens and the earth reversed themselves spinning without a discernible pattern
he felt saphira shudder as thorn battered her exposed belly
eragon wished there had been time to dress her in the armor the dwarves had given her
a glittering ruby leg appeared around saphira is shoulder mauling her with bloody claws
without thinking eragon hacked at it shattering a line of scales and severing a bundle of tendons
three of the toes on the foot went limp
eragon hacked again
snarling thorn disengaged from saphira
he arched his neck and eragon heard an inrush of air as the stocky dragon filled his lungs
eragon ducked burying his face in the corner of his elbow
a ravening inferno engulfed saphira
the heat of the fire could not harm them eragon is wards prevented that but the torrent of incandescent flames was still blinding
saphira veered to the left out of the churning fire
by then murtagh had repaired the damage to thorn is leg and thorn again flung himself at saphira grappling with her as they plummeted in sickening lurches toward the gray tents of the varden
saphira managed to clamp her teeth on the horned crest that projected from the rear of thorn is head despite the points of bone that punctured her tongue
thorn bellowed and thrashed like a hooked fish trying to pull away but he was no match for the iron muscles of saphira is jaws
the two dragons drifted downward side by side like a pair of interlocked leaves
eragon leaned over and slashed crosswise at murtagh is right shoulder not intending to kill him but rather to injure him severely enough to end the fight
unlike during their clash over the burning plains eragon was well rested with his arm as fast as an elf is he was confident murtagh would be defenseless before him
murtagh lifted his shield and blocked the falchion
his reaction was so unexpected eragon faltered then barely had time to recoil and parry as murtagh retaliated swinging zar roc at him the blade humming through the air with inordinate speed
