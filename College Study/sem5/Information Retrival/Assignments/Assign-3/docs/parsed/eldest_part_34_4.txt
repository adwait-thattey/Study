the ants were acting as shepherds for aphids driving and protecting them as well as extracting sustenance from them by massaging the aphids bellies with the tips of their antennae
eragon could hardly believe it but the longer he watched the more he became convinced that he was correct
he traced the ants underground into their complex matrix of warrens and studied how they cared for a certain member of their species that was several times bigger than a normal ant
however he was unable to determine the insect is purpose all he could see were servants swarming around it rotating it and removing the specks of matter it produced at regular intervals
after a time eragon decided that he had gleaned all the information from the ants that he could unless he was willing to sit there for the rest of the day and was about to return to his body when a squirrel jumped into the glade
its appearance was like a blast of light to him attuned as he was to the insects
stunned he was overwhelmed by a rush of sensations and feelings from the animal
he smelled the forest with its nose felt the bark give under his hooked claws and the air swish through his upraised plume of a tail
compared to an ant the squirrel burned with energy and possessed unquestionable intelligence
then it leaped to another branch and faded from his awareness
the forest seemed much darker and quieter than before when eragon opened his eyes
he took a deep breath and looked about appreciating for the first time how much life existed in the world
unfolding his cramped legs he walked over to the rosebush
he bent down and examined the branches and twigs
sure enough aphids and their crimson guardians clung to them
and near the base of the plant was the mound of pine needles that marked the entrance to the ants lair
it was strange to see with his own eyes none of it betrayed the numerous and subtle interactions that he was now aware of
engrossed in his thoughts eragon returned to the clearing wondering what he might be crushing under his feet with every step
when he emerged from under the trees shelter he was startled by how far the sun had ** must have been sitting there for at least three hours
he found oromis in his hut writing with a goose feather quill
the elf finished his line then wiped the nib of the quill clean stoppered his ink and asked and what did you hear eragon
eragon was eager to share
as he described his experience he heard his voice rise with enthusiasm over the details of the ants society
he recounted everything that he could recall down to the minutest and most inconsequential observation proud of the information that he had gathered
when he finished oromis raised an eyebrow
is that all
i
dismay gripped eragon as he understood that he had somehow missed the point of the exercise
yes ebrithil
and what about the other organisms in the earth and the air can you tell me what they were doing while your ants tended their droves
therein lies your mistake
you must become aware of all things equally and not blinker yourself in order to concentrate on a particular subject
this is an essential lesson and until you master it you will meditate on the stump for an hour each day
how will i know when i have mastered it
when you can watch one and know all
oromis motioned for eragon to join him at the table then set a fresh sheet of paper before him along with a quill and a bottle of ink
so far you have made do with an incomplete knowledge of the ancient language
not that any of us knows all the words in the language but you must be familiar with its grammar and structure so that you do not kill yourself through an incorrectly placed verb or similar mistake
i do not expect you to speak our language like an elf that would take a lifetime but i do expect you to achieve unconscious competence
that is you must be able to use it without thinking
in addition you must learn to read and write the ancient language
not only will this help you to memorize words it is an essential skill if you need to compose an especially long spell and you do not trust your memory or if you find such a spell recorded and you want to use it
