a long ermine trimmed cloak embroidered with the insignia of durgrimst ingeitum flowed over orik is shoulders and onto the floor behind him
volund the war hammer that korgan first king of the dwarves had forged hung at orik is waist from a wide ruby studded belt
because of his lavish raiment and his magnificent armor orik seemed to glow from within to look at him dazzled eragon is eyes
twelve dwarf children followed orik six male and six female or so eragon assumed based upon the cut of their hair
the children were garbed in tunics of red and brown and gold and they each carried in their cupped hands a polished orb six inches across every orb a different species of stone
as orik entered the center of the city mountain the chamber dimmed and a pattern of dappled shadows appeared on everything within
confused eragon glanced upward and was astonished to behold pink rose petals drifting downward from the top of tronjheim
like soft thick snowflakes the velvety petals settled upon the heads and shoulders of those in attendance and also upon the floor suffusing the air with their sweet fragrance
the trumpets and the choir fell silent as orik knelt on one knee before the black throne and bowed his head
behind him the twelve children stopped and stood motionless
eragon placed his hand on saphira is warm side sharing his concern and excitement with her
he had no idea what would happen next for orik had refused to describe the ceremony past that point
then gannel clan chief of durgrimst quan stepped forward breaking the ring of people around the chamber and walked to stand on the right hand side of the throne
the heavy shouldered dwarf was appareled in sumptuous red robes the borders of which gleamed with runes outlined with metal thread
in one hand gannel bore a tall staff with a clear pointed crystal mounted on the top
lifting the staff over his head with both hands gannel brought it down upon the stone floor with a resounding crack
hwatum il skilfz ** he exclaimed
he continued to speak in the tongue of the dwarves for some minutes and eragon listened without comprehending for his translator was not with him
but then the tenor of gannel is voice shifted and eragon recognized his words as belonging to the ancient language and he realized gannel was weaving a spell although it was a spell unlike any eragon was familiar with
instead of directing the incantation at an object or an element of the world around them the priest said in the language of mystery and power guntera creator of the heavens and the earth and the boundless sea hear now the cry of your faithful ** we thank you for your magnanimity
our race flourishes
this and every year we have offered to you the finest rams of our flocks and also flagons of spiced mead and a portion of our harvests of fruits and vegetables and grain
your temples are the richest in the land and none may hope to compete with the glory that is yours
o mighty guntera king of the gods hear now mine plea and grant me this request time is for us to name a mortal ruler of our earthly affairs
will you deign to bestow your blessing upon orik thrifk is son and to crown him in the tradition of his predecessors
at first eragon thought gannel is request would go unanswered for he felt no surge of magic from the dwarf when he finished speaking
however saphira nudged him then and said look
eragon followed her gaze and thirty feet above saw a disturbance among the tumbling petals a gap a void where the petals would not fall as if an invisible object occupied the space
the disturbance spread extending all the way to the floor and the void outlined by the petals assumed the shape of a creature with arms and legs like a dwarf or a man or an elf or an urgal but of different proportions than any race eragon had knowledge of the head was nearly the width of the shoulders the massive arms hung below the knees and while the torso was bulky the legs were short and crooked
thin needle sharp rays of watery light radiated outward from the shape and there appeared the nebulous image of a gigantic shaggy haired male figure of the form the petals had traced
