yes sir eragon answered with a quick smile
could you also give her my thanks it was nice of her to stand up to her father for me
i hope that she is not punished because of it
roran would be furious if i got her into trouble
i would not worry about it
sloan does not know that she called me so i doubt he will be too hard on her
before you go will you sup with us
i am sorry but i can not
garrow is expecting me said eragon tying off the top of the pack
he hoisted it onto his back and started down the road raising his hand in farewell
the meat slowed him down but he was eager to be home and renewed vigor filled his steps
the village ended abruptly and he left its warm lights behind
the pearlescent moon peeked over the mountains bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of daylight
everything looked bleached and flat
near the end of his journey he turned off the road which continued south
a simple path led straight through waist high grass and up a knoll almost hidden by the shadows of protective elm trees
he crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining from his home
the house had a shingled roof and a brick chimney
eaves hung over the whitewashed walls shadowing the ground below
one side of the enclosed porch was filled with split wood ready for the fire
a jumble of farm tools cluttered the other side
the house had been abandoned for half a century when they moved in after garrow is wife marian died
it was ten miles from carvahall farther than anyone else is
people considered the distance dangerous because the family could not rely on help from the village in times of trouble but eragon is uncle would not listen
a hundred feet from the house in a dull colored barn lived two horses birka and brugh with chickens and a cow
sometimes there was also a pig but they had been unable to afford one this year
a wagon sat wedged between the stalls
on the edge of their fields a thick line of trees traced along the anora river
he saw a light move behind a window as he wearily reached the porch
uncle it is eragon
let me ** a small shutter slid back for a second then the door swung inward
garrow stood with his hand on the door
his worn clothes hung on him like rags on a stick frame
a lean hungry face with intense eyes gazed out from under graying hair
he looked like a man who had been partly mummified before it was discovered that he was still alive
roran is sleeping was his answer to eragon is inquiring glance
a lantern flickered on a wood table so old that the grain stood up in tiny ridges like a giant fingerprint
near a woodstove were rows of cooking utensils tacked onto the wall with homemade nails
a second door opened to the rest of the house
the floor was made of boards polished smooth by years of tramping feet
eragon pulled off his pack and took out the meat
what is this did you buy meat where did you get the money asked his uncle harshly as he saw the wrapped packages
eragon took a breath before answering
no horst bought it for us
you let him pay for it i told you before i wo not beg for our food
if we can not feed ourselves we might as well move into town
before you can turn around twice they will be sending us used clothes and asking if we will be able to get through the ** garrow is face paled with anger
i did not accept charity snapped eragon
horst agreed to let me work off the debt this spring
he needs someone to help him because albriech is going away
and where will you get the time to work for him are you going to ignore all the things that need to be done here asked garrow forcing his voice down
eragon hung his bow and quiver on hooks beside the front door
i do not know how i will do it he said irritably
besides i found something that could be worth some ** he set the stone on the table
garrow bowed over it the hungry look on his face became ravenous and his fingers moved with a strange twitch
you found this in the spine
yes said eragon
he explained what had happened
and to make matters worse i lost my best arrow
i will have to make more before ** they stared at the stone in the near darkness
