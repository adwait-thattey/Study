if there are not any within a mile in either direction then i suppose she can ferry us
at eragon is request saphira agreed to search for a ford
while she explored they hunkered next to the horses and ate dry bread
it was not long before saphira returned her velvet wings whispering in the early dawn ** water is both deep and strong upstream as well as downstream
once he was told murtagh said i d better go over first so i can watch the ** he scrambled onto saphira is saddle
be careful with tornac
i ve had him for many years
i do not want anything to happen to ** then saphira took off
when she returned the unconscious elf had been untied from her belly
eragon led tornac to saphira ignoring the horse is low whinnies
saphira reared back on her haunches to grasp the horse around the belly with her forelegs
eragon eyed her formidable claws and said ** he repositioned tornac is saddle blanket strapping it to the horse is belly so it protected his soft underside then gestured for saphira to proceed
tornac snorted in fright and tried to bolt when saphira is forelegs clamped around his sides but she held him tightly
the horse rolled his eyes wildly the whites rimming his dilated pupils
eragon tried to gentle tornac with his mind but the horse is panic resisted his touch
before tornac could try to escape again saphira jumped skyward her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws gouged the rocks underneath
her wings strained furiously struggling to lift the enormous load
for a moment it seemed she would fall back to the ground
then with a lunge she shot into the air
tornac screamed in terror kicking and tossing
it was a terrible sound like screeching metal
eragon swore wondering if anyone was close enough to ** d better hurry saphira
he listened for soldiers as he waited scanning the inky landscape for the telltale flash of torches
it soon met his eye in a line of horsemen sliding down a bluff almost a league away
as saphira landed eragon brought snowfire to ** is silly animal is in hysterics
he had to tie tornac down to prevent him from running away
she gripped snowfire and carried him off ignoring the horse is trumpeted protestations
eragon watched her go feeling lonely in the night
the horsemen were only a mile away
finally saphira came for him and they were soon on firm ground once more with the ramr to their backs
once the horses were calmed and the saddles readjusted they resumed their flight toward the beor mountains
the air filled with the calls of birds waking to a new day
eragon dozed even when walking
he was barely aware that murtagh was just as drowsy
there were times when neither of them guided the horses and it was only saphira is vigilance that kept them on course
eventually the ground became soft and gave way under their feet forcing them to halt
the sun was high overhead
the ramr river was no more than a fuzzy line behind them
they had reached the hadarac desert
