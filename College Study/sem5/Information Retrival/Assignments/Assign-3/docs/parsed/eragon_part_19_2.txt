as the sky darkened and they searched for a place to camp eragon asked who was the rider that owned zar roc
a mighty warrior said brom who was much feared in his time and held great power
i will not ** eragon protested but brom was firm
i do not want to keep you ignorant far from it but certain knowledge would only prove dangerous and distracting for you right now
there is not any reason for me to trouble you with such things until you have the time and the power to deal with them
i only wish to protect you from those who would use you for evil
eragon glared at him
you know what i think you just enjoy speaking in riddles
i ve half a mind to leave you so i do not have to be bothered with them
if you re going to say something then say it instead of dancing around with vague **
peace
all will be told in time brom said gently
eragon grunted unconvinced
they found a comfortable place to spend the night and set up camp
saphira joined them as dinner was being set on the ** you have time to hunt for food asked eragon
she snorted with ** the two of you were any slower i would have time to fly across the sea and back without falling behind
you do not have to be insulting
besides we will go faster once we have horses
she let out a puff of ** but will it be enough to catch the ra zac they have a lead of several days and many leagues
and i am afraid they may suspect we re following them
why else would they have destroyed the farm in such a spectacular manner unless they wished to provoke you into chasing them
i do not know said eragon disturbed
saphira curled up beside him and he leaned against her belly welcoming the warmth
brom sat on the other side of the fire whittling two long sticks
he suddenly threw one at eragon who grabbed it out of reflex as it whirled over the crackling flames
eragon looked at the stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a sword
brom wanted to fight him what chance did the old man stand if he wants to play this game so be it but if he thinks to beat me he is in for a surprise
he rose as brom circled the fire
they faced each other for a moment then brom charged swinging his stick
eragon tried to block the attack but was too slow
he yelped as brom struck him on the ribs and stumbled backward
without thinking he lunged forward but brom easily parried the blow
eragon whipped the stick toward brom is head twisted it at the last moment and then tried to hit his side
the solid smack of wood striking wood resounded through the camp
improvisation ** exclaimed brom eyes gleaming
his arm moved in a blur and there was an explosion of pain on the side of eragon is head
he collapsed like an empty sack dazed
a splash of cold water roused him to alertness and he sat up sputtering
his head was ringing and there was dried blood on his face
brom stood over him with a pan of melted snow water
you did not have to do that said eragon angrily pushing himself up
he felt dizzy and unsteady
brom arched an eyebrow
oh a real enemy would not soften his blows and neither will i
should i pander to your
incompetence so you will feel better i do not think ** he picked up the stick that eragon had dropped and held it out
now defend yourself
eragon stared blankly at the piece of wood then shook his head
forget it i ve had ** he turned away and stumbled as he was whacked loudly across the back
he spun around growling
never turn your back to the ** snapped brom then tossed the stick at him and attacked
eragon retreated around the fire beneath the onslaught
pull your arms in
keep your knees bent shouted brom
he continued to give instructions then paused to show eragon exactly how to execute a certain move
do it again but this timeslowly ** they slid through the forms with exaggerated motions before returning to their furious battle
eragon learned quickly but no matter what he tried he could not hold brom off for more than a few blows
when they finished eragon flopped on his blankets and groaned
he hurt everywhere brom had not been gentle with his stick
saphira let out a long coughing growl and curled her lip until a formidable row of teeth showed
