before he could oromis said what now eragon
we have spoken at length on those subjects about which you were curious
what now do you and saphira wish to accomplish you cannot linger in ellesmera so i wonder what else you hope to achieve by your visit or is it your intention to depart again tomorrow morning
we had hoped eragon said that when we returned we would be able to continue our training as before
obviously we have not time for that now but there is something else i would like to do
master i have not told you everything that happened to me when brom and i were in ** and then eragon recounted how curiosity had lured him into angela is shop and how she had told him his fortune and the advice solembum had given him afterward
oromis drew a finger across his upper lip his demeanor contemplative
i have heard this fortuneteller mentioned with increasing frequency throughout this past year both by you and in arya is reports from the varden
this angela seems to be most adept at turning up whenever and wherever events of significance are about to take place
continuing oromis said her behavior reminds me very much of a human spellcaster who once visited the halls of ellesmera although she did not go by the name of angela
is angela a woman of short stature with thick curly brown hair flashing eyes and a wit that is as sharp as it is odd
you have described her perfectly said eragon
is she the same person
oromis made a small flicking motion with his left hand
if she is she is an extraordinary person
as for her prophecies i would not devote much thought to them
either they will come true or they will not and without knowing more none of us can influence the outcome
what the werecat said though is worthy of far more consideration
unfortunately i cannot elucidate either of his statements
i have never heard of any such place as the vault of souls and while the rock of kuthian strikes a familiar chord in my memory i cannot recall where i have encountered the name
i will search my scrolls for it but instinct tells me i will find no mention of it in elvish writings
what of the weapon underneath the menoa tree
i know of no such weapon eragon and i am well acquainted with the lore of this forest
in all of du weldenvarden there are perhaps only two elves whose learning exceeds my own where the forest is concerned
i will inquire of them but i suspect it will be a futile ** when eragon expressed his disappointment oromis said i understand that you require a suitable replacement for zar roc eragon and this i can help you with
besides my own blade naegling we elves have preserved two other swords of the dragon riders
they are arvindr and tamerlein
arvindr is currently held in the city of nadindel which you have not the time to visit
but tamerlein is here in ellesmera
it is a treasure of house valtharos and while the lord of their house lord fiolr would not part with it eagerly i think he would give it to you if you asked him respectfully
i will arrange for you to meet with him tomorrow morning
and what if the sword does not fit me asked eragon
let us hope it does
however i shall also send word to the smith rhunon that she may expect you later in the day
but she swore she would never forge another sword
oromis sighed
she did but her advice would still be worth seeking out
if anyone can recommend the proper weapon for you it would be she
besides even if you like the feel of tamerlein i am sure rhunon would want to examine the sword before you left with it
over a hundred years have elapsed since tamerlein was last used in battle and it might need some slight refurbishing
could another elf forge me a blade asked eragon
nay said oromis
not if it were to match the craftsmanship of zar roc or whichever stolen sword galbatorix has chosen to wield
rhunon is one of the very oldest of our race and it is she alone who has made the swords for our order
she is as old as the riders said eragon amazed
eragon paused
what shall we do between now and tomorrow master
oromis looked over eragon and saphira then said go and visit the menoa tree i know you will not rest easy until you have
