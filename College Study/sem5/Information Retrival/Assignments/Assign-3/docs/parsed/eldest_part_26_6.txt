he sighed
a thunderclap tore roran from sleep
light flared on his face as he struggled to regain awareness like a diver desperate to reach the surface
he opened his eyes and saw a jagged hole blasted through his door
six soldiers rushed through the yawning cleft followed by the two ra zac who seemed to fill the room with their ghastly presence
a sword was pressed against roran is neck
beside him katrina screamed and pulled the blankets around her
up ordered the ra zac
roran cautiously got to his feet
his heart felt like it was about to explode in his chest
tie his handsss and bring him
as a soldier approached roran with rope katrina screamed again and jumped on the men biting and clawing furiously
her sharp nails furrowed their faces drawing streams of blood that blinded the cursing soldiers
roran dropped to one knee and grabbed his hammer from the floor then planted his feet swinging the hammer over his head and roaring like a bear
the soldiers threw themselves at him in an attempt to subdue him through sheer numbers but to no avail katrina was in danger and he was invincible
shields crumpled beneath his blows brigandines and mail split under his merciless weapon and helmets caved in
two men were wounded and three fell to rise no more
the clang and clamor had roused the household roran dimly heard horst and his sons shouting in the hall
the ra zac hissed to one another then scuttled forward and grasped katrina with inhuman strength lifting her off the floor as they fled the room
summoning his energy roran bowled past the two remaining men
he stumbled into the hall and saw the ra zac climbing out a window
roran dashed toward them and struck at the last ra zac just as it was about to descend below the windowsill
jerking upward the ra zac caught roran is wrist in midair and chittered with delight blowing its fetid breath onto his face
** you are the one we **
roran tried to twist free but the ra zac did not budge
with his free hand roran buffeted the creature is head and shoulders which were as hard as iron
desperate and enraged he seized the edge of the ra zac is hood and wrenched it back exposing its features
a hideous tortured face screamed at him
the skin was shiny black like a beetle carapace
the head was bald
each lidless eye was the size of his fist and gleamed like an orb of polished hematite no iris or pupil existed
in place of a nose mouth and chin a thick beak hooked to a sharp point that clacked over a barbed purple tongue
roran yelled and jammed his heels against the sides of the window frame struggling to free himself from the monstrosity but the ra zac inexorably drew him out of the house
he could see katrina on the ground still screaming and fighting
just as roran is knees buckled horst appeared by his side and wrapped a knotted arm around his chest locking him in place
someone get a ** shouted the smith
he snarled veins bulging on his neck from the strain of holding roran
it will take more than this demon spawn to best **
the ra zac gave a final yank then when it failed to dislodge roran cocked its head and said you areoursss ** it lunged forward with blinding speed and roran howled as he felt the ra zac is beak close on his right shoulder snipping through the front of the muscle
his wrist cracked at the same time
with a malicious cackle the ra zac released him and fell backward into the night
horst and roran sprawled against each other in the hallway
they have katrina groaned roran
his vision flickered and went black around the edges as he pushed himself upright on his left arm his right hung useless
albriech and baldor emerged from his room splattered with gore
only corpses remained behind ** i have killed eight
roran retrieved his hammer and staggered down the hall finding his way blocked by elain in her white sleeping shift
she looked at him with wide eyes then took his arm and pushed him down onto a wood chest set against the wall
you have to see gertrude
you will pass out if this bleeding is not stopped
he looked down at his right side it was drenched in crimson
