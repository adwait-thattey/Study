on the way home roran said there was a stranger from therinsford at horst is today
what is his name asked eragon
he sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a brisk pace
his cheeks and eyes burned from the cold
dempton
he came here to have horst forge him some sockets said roran
his stocky legs plowed through a drift clearing the way for eragon
does not therinsford have its own smith
yes replied roran but he is not skilled ** he glanced at eragon
with a shrug he added dempton needs the sockets for his mill
he is expanding it and offered me a job
if i accept i will leave with him when he picks up the sockets
millers worked all year
during winter they ground whatever people brought them but in harvest season they bought grain and sold it as flour
it was hard dangerous work workers often lost fingers or hands to the giant millstones
are you going to tell garrow asked eragon
** a grimly amused smile played across roran is face
what for you know what he thinks about us going away
it will only cause trouble if you say anything
forget about it so we can eat tonight is dinner in peace
i can not
i am going to take the job
eragon halted
why they faced each other their breath visible in the air
i know money is hard to come by but we always manage to survive
you do not have to leave
no i do not
but the money is for ** roran tried to resume walking but eragon refused to budge
what do you need it for he demanded
roran is shoulders straightened slightly
i want to marry
bewilderment and astonishment overwhelmed eragon
he remembered seeing katrina and roran kissing during the traders visit but marriage katrina he asked weakly just to confirm
roran nodded
have you asked her
not yet but come spring when i can raise a house i will
there is too much work on the farm for you to leave now protested eragon
wait until we re ready for planting
no said roran laughing slightly
spring is the time i will be needed the most
the ground will have to be furrowed and sown
the crops must be weeded not to mention all the other chores
no this is the best time for me to go when all we really do is wait for the seasons to change
you and garrow can make do without me
if all goes well i will soon be back working on the farm with a wife
eragon reluctantly conceded that roran made sense
he shook his head but whether with amazement or anger he knew not
i guess i can only wish you the best of luck
but garrow may take this with ill humor
they resumed walking the silence a barrier between them
eragon is heart was disturbed
it would take time before he could look upon this development with favor
when they arrived home roran did not tell garrow of his plans but eragon was sure that he soon would
eragon went to see the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him
he approached apprehensively aware now that it was an equal
is that all you can say he snapped
his eyes widened at the unexpected reply and he sat down ** it has a sense of humor
what next impulsively he broke a dead branch with his foot
roran is announcement had put him in a foul mood
a questioning thought came from the dragon so he told it what had happened
as he talked his voice grew steadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air
he ranted until his emotions were spent then ineffectually punched the ground
i do not want him to go that is all he said helplessly
the dragon watched impassively listening and learning
eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes
he looked at the dragon thoughtfully
you need a name
i heard some interesting ones today perhaps you will like ** he mentally ran through the list brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic noble and pleasing to the ear
what do you think of vanilor or his successor eridor both were great dragons
no said the dragon
it sounded amused with his **
that ismy name you can not have it he said rubbing his chin
well if you do not like those there are ** he continued through the list but the dragon rejected every one he proposed
it seemed to be laughing at something eragon did not understand but he ignored it and kept suggesting names
