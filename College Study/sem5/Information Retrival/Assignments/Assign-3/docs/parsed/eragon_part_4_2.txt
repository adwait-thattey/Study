forsaking their hiding the urgals stood and released a stream of black arrows
the shade jumped out from behind the tree raised his right hand and shouted **
a red bolt flashed from his palm toward the elven lady illuminating the trees with a bloody light
it struck her steed and the horse toppled with a high pitched squeal plowing into the ground chest first
she leapt off the animal with inhuman speed landed lightly then glanced back for her guards
the urgals deadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves
they fell from the noble horses blood pooling in the dirt
as the urgals rushed to the slain elves the shade screamed after ** she is the one i ** the monsters grunted and rushed down the trail
a cry tore from the elf is lips as she saw her dead companions
she took a step toward them then cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest
while the urgals crashed through the trees the shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted above them
from his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest
he raised his hand and uttered boetq ** and a quarter mile section of the forest exploded into flames
grimly he burned one section after another until there was a ring of fire a half league across around the ambush site
the flames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest
satisfied he watched the ring carefully in case it should falter
the band of fire thickened contracting the area the urgals had to search
suddenly the shade heard shouts and a coarse scream
through the trees he saw three of his charges fall in a pile mortally wounded
he caught a glimpse of the elf running from the remaining urgals
she fled toward the craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed
the shade examined the ground twenty feet below then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her
she skidded around and sped back to the trail
black urgal blood dripped from her sword staining the pouch in her hand
the horned monsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in blocking the only escape routes
her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out
seeing none she drew herself up with regal disdain
the shade approached her with a raised hand allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness
as the urgals surged forward the elf pulled open the pouch reached into it and then let it drop to the ground
in her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the angry light of the fires
she raised it over her head lips forming frantic words
desperate the shade barked **
a ball of red flame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf fast as an arrow
but he was too late
a flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest and the stone vanished
then the red fire smote her and she collapsed
the shade howled in rage and stalked forward flinging his sword at a tree
it passed halfway through the trunk where it stuck quivering
he shot nine bolts of energy from his palm which killed the urgals instantly then ripped his sword free and strode to the elf
prophecies of revenge spoken in a wretched language only he knew rolled from his tongue
he clenched his thin hands and glared at the sky
the cold stars stared back unwinking otherworldly watchers
disgust curled his lip before he turned back to the unconscious elf
her beauty which would have entranced any mortal man held no charm for him
he confirmed that the stone was gone then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among the trees
after tying the elf onto the saddle he mounted the charger and made his way out of the woods
he quenched the fires in his path but left the rest to burn
