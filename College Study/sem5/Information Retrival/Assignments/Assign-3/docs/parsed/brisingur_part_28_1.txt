roran stepped out of the tent buckling on his belt
he coughed and squinted in the dust
what brings you here he asked as eragon dismounted
speaking quickly eragon told them of his impending departure and impressed upon them the importance of keeping his absence a secret from the rest of the villagers
no matter how slighted they feel because i supposedly refuse to see them you cannot reveal the truth to them not even to horst or elain
let them think i have become a rude and ungrateful lout before you so much as utter a word about nasuada is scheme
this i ask of you for the sake of everyone who has pitted themselves against the empire
will you do it
we would never betray you eragon said katrina
of that you need have no doubts
then roran said that he too was leaving
i just received my assignment a few minutes ago
we are going to raid the empire is supply trains somewhere well north of us behind enemy lines
eragon gazed at the three of them in turn
first roran serious and determined already tense with anticipation of battle then katrina worried and trying to conceal it and then saphira whose nostrils flickered with small tongues of flame which sputtered as she breathed
so we are all going our separate ** what he did not say but which hung over them like a shroud was that they might never again see each other alive
grasping eragon by the forearm roran pulled him close and hugged him for a moment
he released eragon and stared deep into his eyes
guard your back brother
galbatorix is not the only one who would like to slip a knife between your ribs when you are not looking
do the same yourself
and if you find yourself facing a spellcaster run in the opposite direction
the wards i placed around you wo not last forever
katrina hugged eragon and whispered do not take too long
together roran and katrina went to saphira and touched their foreheads to her long bony snout
her chest vibrated as she produced a pure bass note deep within her throat
remember roran she said do not make the mistake of leaving your enemies alive
and katrina do not dwell on that which you cannot change
it will only worsen your distress
with a rustle of skin and scales saphira unfolded her wings and enveloped roran katrina and eragon in a warm embrace isolating them from the world
as saphira lifted her wings roran and katrina stepped away while eragon climbed onto her back
he waved at the newlywed couple a lump in his throat and continued waving even as saphira took to the air
blinking to clear his eyes eragon leaned against the spike behind him and gazed up at the tilting sky
to the cook tents now asked saphira
saphira climbed a few hundred feet before she aimed herself at the southwestern quadrant of the camp where pillars of smoke drifted up from rows of ovens and large wide pit fires
a thin stream of wind slipped past her and eragon as she glided downward toward a clear patch of ground between two open walled tents each fifty feet long
breakfast was over so the tents were empty of men when saphira landed with a loud thump
eragon hurried toward the fires beyond the plank tables saphira beside him
the many hundreds of men who were busy tending the fires carving meat cracking eggs kneading dough stirring cast iron kettles full of mysterious liquids scrubbing clean enormous piles of dirty pots and pans and who were otherwise engaged in the enormous and never ending task of preparing food for the varden did not pause to gawk at eragon and saphira
for what importance was a dragon and rider compared with the merciless demands of the ravenous many mouthed creature whose hunger they were striving to sate
a stout man with a close cropped beard of white and black who was almost short enough to pass for a dwarf trotted over to eragon and saphira and gave a curt bow
i am quoth merrinsson
how can i help you if you want shadeslayer we have some bread that just finished ** he gestured toward a double row of sourdough loaves resting on a platter on a nearby table
i might have half a loaf if you can spare it said eragon
however my hunger is not the reason for our visit
