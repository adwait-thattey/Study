are all your boats made this way he asked
all except the very largest answered nari seating himself at the prow of eragon is vessel
for those we sing the finest cedar and oak into shape
before eragon could ask what he meant orik joined their canoe while arya and lifaen appropriated the second one
arya turned to edurna and celdin who stood on the bank and said guard this way so that none may follow us and tell no one of our presence
the queen must be the first to know
i will send reinforcements as soon as we reach silthrim
may the stars watch over ** she answered
bending forward nari and lifaen drew spiked poles ten feet long from inside the boats and began propelling the vessels upstream
saphira slid into the water behind them and clawed her way along the riverbed until they were level
when eragon looked at her she winked lazily then submerged forcing the river to swell into a mound over her jagged back
the elves laughed as she did so and made many compliments about her size and strength
after an hour they reached eldor lake which was rough with small jagged waves
birds and flies swarmed by a wall of trees edging the western shore while the eastern shore sloped up into the plains
on that side meandered hundreds of deer
once they escaped the river is current nari and lifaen stowed their poles then distributed leaf bladed paddles
orik and arya already knew how to steer a boat but nari had to explain the process to eragon
we turn toward whichever side you paddle on said the elf
so if i paddle on the right and orik paddles on the left then you must paddle first on one side then the other else we will drift off ** in the daylight nari is hair shimmered like the finest wire each strand a fiery line
eragon soon mastered the ability and as the motion became habitual his mind was freed to daydream
thus he floated up the cool lake lost in the fantastic worlds hidden behind his eyes
when he paused to rest his arms he once again pulled orik is puzzle ring from his belt and struggled to arrange the obstinate gold bands into the correct pattern
nari noticed what he was doing
may i see that ring
eragon passed it to the elf who turned his back
for a few moments eragon and orik maneuvered the canoe alone as nari picked at the entwined bands
then with a pleased exclamation nari raised his hand and the completed ring flashed on his middle finger
a delightful riddle said nari
he slipped off the ring and shook it so that it was in its original state when he returned it to eragon
how did you solve it demanded eragon dismayed and envious that nari had been able to master the puzzle so easily
wait
do not tell me
i want to figure it out on my own
