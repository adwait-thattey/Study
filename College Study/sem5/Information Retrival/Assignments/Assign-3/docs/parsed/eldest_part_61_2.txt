do not stand here gawking get back to your posts or i will have the lot of you chalked up for extra ** at his command the men began to disperse with many a grumbled word and backward glance
then fredric drew nearer and eragon could tell was startled by the change in eragon is countenance
the bearded man did his best to conceal the reaction by touching his brow and saying welcome shadeslayer
you ve arrived just in time
i can not tell you how ashamed i am you were attacked
the honor of every man here has been blackened by this mistake
were the three of you hurt
relief spread across fredric is face
well there is that to be grateful for
i ve had the men responsible pulled from duty
they will each be whipped and reduced in rank
will that punishment satisfy you rider
i want to see them said eragon
sudden concern emanated from fredric it was obvious he feared that eragon wanted to enact some terrible and unnatural retribution on the sentinels
fredric did not voice his concern however but said if you d follow me then sir
he led them through the camp to a striped command tent where twenty or so miserable looking men were divesting themselves of their arms and armor under the watchful eye of a dozen guards
at the sight of eragon and saphira the prisoners all went down on one knee and remained there gazing at the ground
hail ** they cried
eragon said nothing but walked along the line of men while he studied their minds his boots sinking through the crust of the baked earth with an ominous crunch
at last he said you should be proud that you reacted so quickly to our appearance
if galbatorix attacks that is exactly what you should do though i doubt arrows would prove any more effective against him than they were against saphira and ** the sentinels glanced at him with disbelief their upturned faces tinted the color of tarnished brass by the variegated light
i only ask that in the future you take a moment to identify your target before shooting
next time i might be too distracted to stop your missiles
am i understood
stopping before the second to last man in the line eragon held out the arrow he had snared from saphira is back
i believe this is yours harwin
with an expression of wonder harwin accepted the arrow from eragon
so it ** it has the white band i always paint on my shafts so i can find them later
thank you shadeslayer
eragon nodded and then said to fredric so all could hear these are good and true men and i want no misfortune to befall them because of this event
i will see to it personally said fredric and smiled
now can you take us to lady nasuada
as he left the sentinels eragon knew that his kindness had earned him their undying loyalty and that tidings of his deed would spread throughout the varden
the path fredric took through the tents brought eragon into close contact with more minds than he had ever touched before
hundreds of thoughts images and sensations pressed against his consciousness
despite his effort to keep them at a distance he could not help absorbing random details of people is lives
some revelations he found shocking some meaningless others touching or conversely disgusting and many embarrassing
a few people perceived the world so differently their minds leaped out at him on account of that very difference
how easy it is to view these men as nothing more than objects that i and a few others can manipulate at will
yet they each possess hopes and dreams potential for what they might achieve and memories of what they have already accomplished
and they all feel pain
a handful of the minds he touched were aware of the contact and recoiled from it hiding their inner life behind defenses of varying strength
at first eragon was concerned imagining that he had discovered a great many enemies who had infiltrated the varden but then he realized from his quick glimpse that they were the individual members of du vrangr gata
saphira said they must be scared out of their wits thinking that they re about to be assaulted by some strange magician
i can not convince them otherwise while they block me like this
