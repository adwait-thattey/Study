stenr ** he growled under his breath
what are you up to stronghammer asked carn dropping onto the log where roran sat
slipping the stone into his belt roran accepted the bread and cheese carn had brought him and said nothing
just woolgath ering
carn nodded
most do before a mission
as he ate roran allowed his gaze to drift over the men he found himself with
their group was thirty strong himself included
they were all hardened warriors
everyone carried a bow and most also wore a sword although a few chose to fight with a spear or with a mace or a hammer
of the thirty men he guessed that seven or eight were close to his own age while the rest were several years older
the eldest among them was their captain martland redbeard the deposed earl of thun who had seen enough winters that his famed beard had become frosted with silver hairs
when roran had first joined martland is command he had presented himself to martland in his tent
the earl was a short man with powerful limbs from a lifetime of riding horses and wielding swords
his titular beard was thick and well groomed and hung to the middle of his sternum
after looking roran over the earl had said lady nasuada has told me great things about you my boy and i have heard much else from the stories my men tell rumors gossip hearsay and the like
you know how it is
no doubt you have accomplished notable feats bearding the ra zac in their own den for example now there was a tricky piece of work
of course you had your cousin to help you did not you hmm
you may be accustomed to having your way with the people from your village but you are part of the varden now my boy
more specifically you are one of my warriors
we are not your family
we are not your neighbors
we are not even necessarily your friends
our duty is to carry out nasuada is orders and carry them out we will no matter how any one of us might feel about it
while you serve under me you will do what i tell you when i tell you and how i tell you or i swear upon the bones of my blessed mother may she rest in peace i will personally whip the skin off your back no matter to whom you may be related
do you understand
very good
if you behave yourself and show you have some common sense and if you can manage to stay alive it is possible for a man of determination to advance quickly among the varden
whether you do or not however depends entirely on if i deem you fit to command men of your own
but do not you believe not for one moment not one blasted moment that you can flatter me into a good opinion of you
i do not care whether you like or hate me
my only concern is whether you can do what needs to be done
yes well maybe you do at that stronghammer
we shall know soon enough
leave and report to ulhart my right hand man
roran swallowed the last of his bread and washed it down with a swig of wine from the skin he carried
he wished they could have had a hot dinner that night but they were deep in the empire is territory and soldiers might have spotted a fire
with a sigh he stretched out his legs
his knees were sore from riding snowfire from dusk until dawn for the past three days
in the back of his mind roran felt a faint but constant pressure a mental itch that night or day pointed him in the same direction the direction of katrina
the source of the sensation was the ring eragon had given him and it was a comfort to roran knowing that because of it he and katrina could find each other anywhere in alagaesia even if they were both blind and deaf
beside him he heard carn muttering phrases in the ancient language and he smiled
carn was their spellcaster sent to ensure that an enemy magician could not kill them all with a wave of his hand
from some of the other men roran had gathered that carn was not a particularly strong magician he struggled to cast every spell but that he compensated for his weakness by inventing extraordinarily clever spells and by excelling at worming his way into his opponents minds
carn was thin of face and thin of body with drooping eyes and a nervous excitable air
roran had taken an immediate liking to him
