eragon arrived at the base of the first hill an hour later where he found the remnants of an ancient road paved with squares of stone
he followed it toward the ruins wondering at its strange construction for it was unlike any human elf or dwarf work he was familiar with
the shadows under the oak trees chilled eragon as he climbed the central hill
near the summit the ground leveled off underneath his feet and the thicket opened up and he entered a large glade
a broken tower stood there
the lower part of the tower was wide and ribbed like the trunk of a tree
then the structure narrowed and rose toward the sky for over thirty feet ending in a sharp jagged line
the upper half of the tower lay on the ground shattered into innumerable fragments
excitement stirred within eragon
he suspected that he had found an elven outpost erected long before the destruction of the riders
no other race had the skill or inclination to build such a structure
then he spotted the vegetable garden at the opposite side of the glade
a single man sat hunched among the rows of plants weeding a patch of snap peas
shadows covered his downturned face
his gray beard was so long it lay piled in his lap like a mound of uncombed wool
without looking up the man said well are you going to help me finish these peas or not there is a meal in it for you if you do
eragon hesitated unsure what to do
then he thought why should i be afraid of an old hermit and walked over to the garden
i am bergan
bergan son of garrow
the man grunted
tenga son of ingvar
the armor in eragon is pack rattled as he dropped it to the ground
for the next hour he labored in silence along with tenga
he knew he should not stay for so long but he enjoyed the task it kept him from brooding
as he weeded he allowed his mind to expand and touch the multitude of living things within the glade
he welcomed the sense of unity he shared with them
when they had removed every last bit of grass purslane and dandelions from around the peas eragon followed tenga to a narrow door set into the front of the tower through which was a spacious kitchen and dining room
in the middle of the room a circular staircase coiled up to the second story
books scrolls and sheaves of loose bound vellum covered every available surface including a goodly portion of the floor
tenga pointed at the small pile of branches in the fireplace
with a pop and a crackle the wood burst into flame
eragon tensed ready to grapple physically and mentally with tenga
the other man did not seem to notice his reaction but continued to bustle about the kitchen procuring mugs dishes knives and various leftovers for their lunch
he muttered to himself in an undertone while he did
every sense alert eragon sank onto the bare corner of a nearby chair
he did not utter the ancient language he thought
even if he said the spell in his head he still risked death or worse to start a mere ** for as oromis had taught eragon words were the means by which one controlled the release of magic
to cast a spell without the structure of language binding that motive power was to risk having a stray thought or emotion distort the result
eragon gazed around the chamber searching for clues about his host
he spotted an open scroll that displayed columns of words from the ancient language and recognized it as a compendium of true names similar to those he had studied in ellesmera
magicians coveted such scrolls and books and would sacrifice almost anything to obtain them for with them one could learn new words for a spell and also record therein words one had discovered
few however were able to acquire a compendium for they were exceedingly rare and those who already owned them almost never parted with them willingly
it was unusual then for tenga to possess one such compendium but to eragon is amazement he saw six others throughout the room in addition to writings on subjects ranging from history to mathematics to astronomy to botany
a mug of ale and a plate with bread cheese and a slice of cold meat pie appeared in front of him as tenga shoved the dishes under his nose
