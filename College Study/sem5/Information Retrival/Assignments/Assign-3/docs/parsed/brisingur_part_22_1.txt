blodhgarm accompanied eragon as he strode into the pavilion toward fredric
as soon as they stepped underneath the cloth roof the men inside fell silent their eyes fixed on the two of them
then they resumed their activities albeit with quicker steps and quieter voices
raising an arm in welcome fredric hurried to meet them
as always he wore his suit of hairy oxhide armor which smelled nearly as offensive as the animal must have in its original form as well as a massive two handed sword hung crosswise over his back the hilt projecting above his right shoulder
** he rumbled
how can i help you this fine afternoon
fredric is smile broke through his beard
ah i wondered if you d be visiting me about that
when you set out for helgrind without a blade in hand i thought well maybe you re beyond such things now
maybe you can do all your fighting with magic
well i can not say as i am sorry
everyone needs a good sword no matter how skilled they may be with conjuring
in the end it always comes down to steel against steel
just you watch that is how this fight with the empire will be resolved with the point of a sword being driven through galbatorix is accursed heart
heh i d wager a year is wages that even galbatorix has a sword of his own and that he uses it too despite him being able to gut you like a fish with a flick of his finger
nothing can quite compare to the feel of fine steel in your fist
while he spoke fredric led them toward a rack of swords that stood apart from the others
what kind of sword are you looking for he asked
that zar roc you had was a one handed sword if i remember rightly
with a blade about two thumbs wide two of my thumbs in any case and of a shape equally suited for both the cut and thrust yes eragon indicated that was so and the weapon master grunted and began to pull swords off the rack and swing them through the air only to replace them with seeming dissatisfaction
elf blades tend to be thinner and lighter than ours or the dwarves on account of the enchantments they forge into the steel
if we made ours as delicate as theirs the swords would not last more than a minute in a battle before bending breaking or chipping so badly you could not cut soft cheese with ** his eyes darted toward blodhgarm
is not that so elf
even as you say human responded blodhgarm in a perfectly modulated voice
fredric nodded and examined the edge of another sword then snorted and dropped it back on the rack
which means whatever sword you choose will probably be heavier than you re used to
that should not pose much difficulty for you shadeslayer but the extra weight may still upset the timing of your blows
i appreciate the warning said eragon
not at all said fredric
that is what i am here for to keep as many of the varden from getting killed as i can and to help them kill as many of galbatorix is blasted soldiers as i can
it is a good ** leaving the rack he lumbered over to another one hidden behind a pile of rectangular shields
finding the right sword for someone is an art unto itself
a sword should feel like an extension of your arm as if it had grown out of your very flesh
you should not have to think about how you want it to move you should simply move it as instinctively as an egret his beak or a dragon her claws
the perfect sword is intent incarnate what you want so it does
with a modest expression fredric half shrugged
i ve been picking weapons for men who are about to march into combat for twenty six years
it seeps into your bones after a while turns your mind to thoughts of fate and destiny and whether that young fellow i sent off with a billed pike would still be alive if i had given him a mace ** fredric paused with a hand hovering over the middle sword on the rack and looked at eragon
do you prefer to fight with or without a shield
with eragon said
but i can not carry one around with me all the time
and there never seems to be one handy when i am attacked
fredric tapped the hilt of the sword and gnawed on the edge of his beard
humph
so you need a sword you can use by itself but that is not too long to use with every kind of shield from a buckler to a wall shield
