he is a fine war chief
i see
why did you want to come though
the urgal lifted his square chin baring his throat
you are firesword
you must not die or the urgralgra the urgals as you name us will not have our revenge against galbatorix and our race will die in this land
therefore i will run with you
i am the best of our fighters
i have defeated forty two rams in single combat
eragon nodded not displeased by the turn of events
of all the urgals he trusted garzhvog the most for he had probed the kull is consciousness before the battle of the burning plains and had discovered that by the standards of his race garzhvog was honest and reliable
as long as he does not decide that his honor requires him to challenge me to a duel we should have no cause for conflict
very well nar garzhvog he said tightening the strap of the pack around his waist let us run together you and i as has not happened in the whole of recorded history
garzhvog chuckled deep in his chest
let us run firesword
together they faced east and together they set forth for the beor mountains eragon running light and swift and garzhvog loping beside him taking one stride for every two of eragon is the earth shuddering beneath the burden of his weight
above them swollen thunderheads gathered along the horizon portending a torrential storm and circling hawks uttered lonesome cries as they hunted their prey
