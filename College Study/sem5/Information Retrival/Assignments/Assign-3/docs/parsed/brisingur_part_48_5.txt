if he had had the strength to refrain from returning to carvahall you never would have found saphira is egg the ra zac would not have killed your uncle and many things that were not would have been and many things that are would not be
he could not cut you out of his heart though
eragon clenched his jaw as a tremor coursed through him
and after he learned saphira had hatched for me
oromis hesitated and his calm expression became somewhat troubled
i am not sure eragon
it may have been that brom was still trying to protect you from his enemies and he did not tell you for the same reason he did not bring you to the varden straight away because it would have been more than you were ready for
perhaps he was planning to tell you just before you went to the varden
if i had to guess though i would guess that brom held his tongue not because he was ashamed of you but because he had become accustomed to living with his secrets and was loath to part with them
and because and this is no more than speculation because he was uncertain how you might react to his revelation
by your own account you were not that well acquainted with brom before you left carvahall with him
it is quite possible he was afraid that you might hate him if he told you he was your father
hate him exclaimed eragon
i would not have hated him
although
i might not have believed him
and would you have trusted him after such a revelation
eragon bit the inside of his cheek
no i would not have
continuing oromis said brom did the best he could in what were incredibly trying circumstances
before all else it was his responsibility to keep the two of you alive and to teach and advise you eragon so that you would not use your power for selfish means as galbatorix has done
in that brom acquitted himself with distinction
he may not have been the father you wished him to be but he gave you as great an inheritance as any son has ever had
it was no more than he would have done for whoever became the new rider
that does not diminish its value oromis pointed out
but you are mistaken brom did more for you than he would have for anyone else
you need only think of how he sacrificed himself to save your life to know the truth of that
with the nail of his right index finger eragon picked at the edge of the table following a faint ridge formed by one of the rings in the wood
and it really was an accident that arya sent saphira to me
it was oromis confirmed
but it was not entirely a coincidence
instead of transporting the egg to the father arya made it appear before the son
how could that be if she had no knowledge of me
oromis is thin shoulders rose and fell
despite thousands of years of study we still cannot predict or explain all of the effects of magic
eragon continued to finger the small ridge in the edge of the table
i have a father he thought
i watched him die and i had no idea who he was to me
my parents he said were they ever married
i know why you ask eragon and i do not know if my answer will satisfy you
marriage is not an elvish custom and the subtleties of it often escape me
no one joined brom is and selena is hands in marriage but i know that they considered themselves to be husband and wife
if you are wise you will not worry that others of your race may call you a bastard but rather be content to know that you are your parents child and that they both gave their lives that you might live
it surprised eragon how calm he felt
his entire life he had speculated about the identity of his father
when murtagh had claimed it was morzan the revelation had shocked eragon as deeply as had the death of garrow
glaedr is counterclaim that eragon is father was brom had also shocked him but the shock did not seem to have lasted perhaps because this time the news was not as upsetting
calm as he was eragon thought that it might be many years before he was certain of his feelings toward either of his parents
my father was a rider and my mother was morzan is consort and black hand
could i tell nasuada he asked
oromis spread his hands
tell whomever you wish the secret is now yours to do with as you please
