i will send for her immediately
and arya too we need the elves approval before making this decision public
it should not be difficult to procure arya cannot go against our counciland you eragon
she will have to agree with our judgment
wait commanded elessari a steely glint in her eyes
your word though rider
will you give it in fealty at the ceremony
yes you must do that agreed falberd
the varden would be disgraced if we could not provide you every protection
a nice way to put it
it was worth a try said ** fear you have no choice now
they would not dare harm us if i refused
no but they could cause us no end of grief
it is not for my own sake that i say accept but for yours
many dangers exist that i cannot protect you from eragon
with galbatorix set against us you need allies not enemies around you
we cannot afford to contend with both the empire and the varden
finally i will give ** all around the table were signs of relaxation even a poorly concealed sigh from ** re afraid of us
as well they should be sniped saphira
jormundur called for jarsha and with a few words sent the boy scampering off for nasuada and arya
while he was gone the conversation fell into an uncomfortable silence
eragon ignored the council focusing instead on working a way out of his dilemma
none sprang to mind
when the door opened again everyone turned expectantly
first came nasuada chin held high and eyes steady
her embroidered gown was the deepest shade of black deeper even than her skin broken only by a slash of royal purple that stretched from shoulder to hip
behind her was arya her stride as lithe and smooth as a cat is and an openly awestruck jarsha
the boy was dismissed then jormundur helped nasuada into a seat
eragon hastened to do the same for arya but she ignored the proffered chair and stood at a distance from the ** he said let her know all that is happened
i have a feeling the council wo not inform her that they ve compelled me to give the varden my loyalty
arya acknowledged jormundur with a nod then concentrated on nasuada
nasuada daughter of ajihad the council of elders wishes to formally extend its deepest condolences for the loss you more than anyone else have suffered
in a lower voice he added you have our personal sympathies as well
we all know what it is like to have a family member killed by the empire
thank you murmured nasuada lowering her almond eyes
she sat shy and demure and with an air of vulnerability that made eragon want to comfort her
her demeanor was tragically different from that of the energetic young woman who had visited him and saphira in the dragonhold before the battle
although this is your time of mourning a quandary exists that you must resolve
this council cannot lead the varden
and someone must replace your father after the funeral
we ask that you receive the position
as his heir it is rightfully yours the varden expect it of you
nasuada bowed her head with shining eyes
grief was plain in her voice when she said i never thought i would be called upon to take my father is place so young
yet
if you insist it is my duty
i will embrace the office
