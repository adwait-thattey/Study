as eragon continued to muse upon the subject another question occurred to him
why is it that i ve never heard mention of the hearts of dragons in the stories of old surely if they are so important the bards and scholars would speak of them
oromis laid a hand flat on the table then and said of all the secrets in alagaesia that of the eldunari is one of the most closely guarded even among my own people
throughout history dragons have striven to hide their hearts from the rest of the world
they revealed their existence to us only after the magical pact between our races was established and then only to a select few
ah said glaedr often we despised the need for secrecy but if ever the eldunari had become common knowledge every low minded scoundrel in the land would have attempted to steal one and eventually some would have achieved their goal
it was an outcome we went to great lengths to prevent
is there no way for a dragon to defend themselves through their eldunari eragon asked
glaedr is eye seemed to twinkle brighter than ever
an apt question
a dragon who has disgorged their eldunari but who still enjoys the use of their flesh can of course defend their heart with their claws and their fangs and their tail and with the battering of their wings
a dragon whose body is dead however possesses none of those advantages
their only weapon is the weapon of their mind and perhaps if the moment is right the weapon of magic which we cannot command at will
that is one reason why many dragons did not choose to prolong their existence beyond the demise of their flesh
to be unable to move of your own volition to be unable to sense the world around you except through the minds of others and to only be able to influence the course of events with your thoughts and with rare and unpredictable flashes of magic it would be a difficult existence to embrace for most any creature but especially dragons who are the freest of all beings
why would they then asked eragon
sometimes it happened by accident
as their body was failing a dragon might panic and flee into their eldunari
or if a dragon had disgorged their heart before their body died they would have no choice but to continue to endure
but mostly the dragons who chose to live on in their eldunari were those who were old beyond measure older than oromis and i are now old enough that the concerns of the flesh had ceased to matter to them and they had turned in on themselves and wished to spend the rest of eternity pondering questions younger beings could not comprehend
we revered and treasured the hearts of such dragons on account of their vast wisdom and intelligence
it was common for wild dragons and paired dragons alike as well as riders to seek advice from them on matters of importance
that galbatorix enslaved them is a crime of almost unimaginable cruelty and evil
now i have a question said saphira the rich thrum of her thoughts running through eragon is mind
once one of our kind becomes confined to their eldunari must they continue to exist or is it possible for them if they could no longer endure their condition to release their hold on the world and pass into the darkness beyond
not on their own said oromis
not unless the inspiration to use magic should sweep over the dragon and allow them to break their eldunari from within which to my knowledge has happened but rarely
the only other option would be for the dragon to convince someone else to smash the eldunari for them
that lack of control is another reason why dragons were extremely wary of transferring themselves into their heart of hearts lest they trap themselves in a prison from which there was no escape
eragon could feel saphira is loathing at the thought of that prospect
she did not speak of it however but asked how many eldunari does galbatorix hold in his thrall
we do not know the exact number said oromis but we estimate that his hoard contains many hundreds
a wriggle shimmered down saphira is glittering length
so then our race is not on the verge of extinction after all
