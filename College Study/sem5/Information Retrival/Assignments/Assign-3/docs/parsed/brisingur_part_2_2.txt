murtagh however has denounced his dead father is villainy and fled galbatorix is court to seek his own destiny
and he tells eragon that the sword zar roc once belonged to murtagh is father
just before they are overwhelmed by the urgals eragon and his friends are rescued by the varden who live in farthen dur a hollow mountain that is also home to the dwarves capital tronjheim
once inside eragon is taken to ajihad leader of the varden while murtagh is imprisoned because of his relation to morzan
eragon meets with the dwarf king hrothgar and ajihad is daughter nasuada and is tested by the twins two rather nasty magicians who serve ajihad
eragon and saphira also bless one of the varden is orphan babies while the varden heal arya of her poisoning
eragon is stay is disrupted by news of an urgal army approaching underground through the dwarves tunnels
in the battle that follows eragon is separated from saphira and forced to fight durza alone
far stronger than any human durza easily defeats eragon slashing open his back from shoulder to hip
at that moment saphira and arya break the roof of a chamber a sixty foot wide star sapphire distracting durza long enough for eragon to stab him through the heart
freed from durza is spells which were controlling them the urgals are driven back
while eragon lies unconscious after the battle he is telepathically contacted by a being who identifies himself as togira ikonoka the cripple who is whole
he urges eragon to seek him for instruction in ellesmera the elves capital
when eragon wakes he has a huge scar across his back
dismayed he also realizes he only slew durza through sheer luck and that he desperately needs more training
and at the end of book one he decides that yes he will find this togira ikonoka and learn from him
eragon and saphira decide they must leave for ellesmera to begin their training with the cripple who is whole
before they go the dwarf king hrothgar offers to adopt eragon into his clan the durgrimst ingeitum and eragon accepts which gives him full legal rights as a dwarf and entitles him to participate in dwarvish councils
both arya and orik hrothgar is foster son accompany eragon and saphira on their journey to the land of the elves
en route they stop in tarnag a dwarf city
some of the dwarves are friendly but eragon learns that one clan in particular does not welcome him and saphira the az sweldn rak anhuin who hate riders and dragons because the forsworn slaughtered so many of their clan
the party finally arrives in du weldenvarden the forest of the elves
at ellesmera eragon and saphira meet islanzadi queen of the elves who they learn is arya is mother
they also meet with the cripple who is whole an ancient elf named oromis
he too is a rider
oromis and his dragon glaedr have kept their existence hidden from galbatorix for the past hundred years while they searched for a way to overthrow the king
both oromis and glaedr are afflicted with old wounds that prevent them from fighting glaedr is missing a leg and oromis who was captured and broken by the forsworn is unable to control large amounts of magic and is prone to debilitating seizures
eragon and saphira begin their training both together and separately
eragon learns more about the history of alagaesia is races swordsmanship and the ancient language which all magicians use
in his studies of the ancient language he discovers he made a terrible mistake when he and saphira blessed the orphaned baby in farthen dur he intended to say may you be shielded from misfortune but what he actually said was may you be a shield from ** he has cursed the baby to shield others from any and all pain and misfortune
saphira makes quick progress learning from glaedr but the scar eragon bears as a result of his battle with durza slows his training
not only is the mark on his back disfiguring but at unexpected times it incapacitates him with painful spasms
he does not know how he will improve as a magician and swordsman if his convulsions continue
eragon begins to realize he has feelings for arya
