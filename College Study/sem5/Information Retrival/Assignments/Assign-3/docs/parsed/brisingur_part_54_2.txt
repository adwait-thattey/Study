you may thank me by killing galbatorix
if there is any sword destined to slay that mad king it is this one
i shall try my hardest rhunon elda
the elf woman nodded appearing satisfied
well you finally have a sword of your own which is as it ought to be
now you are truly a dragon **
yes said eragon and held the sword up toward the sky admiring it
now i am truly a rider
before you leave one last thing remains for you to do said rhunon
she flicked a finger toward the sword
you must name it so i can mark the blade and scabbard with the appropriate glyph
eragon walked over to saphira and said what do you think
i am not the one who must carry the blade
name it as you see fit
yes but you must have some **
she lowered her head toward him and sniffed at the sword then said blue gem tooth is what i would name it
or blue claw red
that would sound ridiculous to humans
then what of reaver or gutripper or maybe battleclaw or glitter thorn or limbhacker you could name it terror or pain or armbiter or eversharp or ripplescale that on account of the lines in the steel
there is also tongue of death and elfsteel and starmetal and many others besides
her sudden outpouring surprised eragon
you have a talent for this he said
inventing random names is easy
inventing the right name however can try the patience of even an elf
and what if we actually kill galbatorix what then will you do nothing else of worth with your sword
mmh
placing the sword alongside saphira is left foreleg eragon said it is exactly the same color as you
i could name it after you
a low growl sounded in saphira is chest
no
he fought back a smile
are you sure just imagine if we were in battle and
her claws sank into the earth
no
i am not a thing for you to wave about and make fun of
no you re right
i am sorry
well what if i named it hope in the ancient language zar roc means misery so would not it be fitting if i were to wield a sword that by its very name would counteract misery
a noble sentiment said saphira
but do you really want to give your enemies hope do you want to stab galbatorix with hope
it is an amusing pun he said chuckling
stymied eragon grimaced and rubbed his chin studying the play of light across the glittering blade
as he gazed into the depths of the steel his eye chanced upon the flamelike pattern that marked the transition between the softer steel of the spine and that of the edges and he recalled the word brom had used to light his pipe during the memory saphira had shared with him
then eragon thought of yazuac where he had first used magic and also of his duel with durza in farthen dur and in that instant he knew without doubt that he had found the right name for his sword
eragon consulted with saphira and when she agreed with his choice he lifted the weapon to shoulder level and said i am decided
sword i name thee **
and with a sound like rushing wind the blade burst into fire an envelope of sapphire blue flames writhing about the razor sharp steel
uttering a startled cry eragon dropped the sword and jumped back afraid of being burned
the blade continued to blaze on the ground the translucent flames charring a nearby clump of grass
it was then that eragon realized it was he who was providing the energy to sustain the unnatural fire
he quickly ended the magic and the fire vanished from the sword
puzzled by how he could have cast a spell without intending to he picked up the sword again and tapped the blade with the tip of a finger
it was no hotter than before
a heavy scowl on her brow rhunon stalked forward seized the sword from eragon and examined it from tip to pommel
you are fortunate i have already protected it with wards against heat and damage else you would have just scratched the guard and destroyed the temper of the blade
do not drop the sword again shadeslayer even if it should turn into a snake or else i shall take it back and give you a worn out hammer ** eragon apologized and appearing somewhat mollified rhunon handed the sword back to him
did you set fire to it on purpose she asked
no said eragon unable to explain what had happened
