murtagh and thorn had been seen flying toward uru baen no doubt to be chastised in person and nasuada and arya agreed with eragon that those two would probably then continue northward to confront queen islanzadi and the army under her command once the elves made their first strike and revealed their presence
and if possible it would be good to eliminate the ra zac before they started to terrorize and demoralize the varden is warriors
saphira had then pointed out in the most diplomatic of terms that if nasuada asserted her authority as eragon is liegelord and forbade him from participating in the sortie it would poison their relationship with the sort of rancor and dissent that could undermine the varden is cause
but said saphira the choice is yours
keep eragon here if you want
however his commitments are not mine and i for one have decided to accompany roran
it seems like a fine adventure
a faint smile touched eragon is lips as he recalled the scene
the combined weight of saphira is declaration and her impregnable logic had convinced nasuada and arya to grant their approval albeit grudgingly
afterward nasuada had said we are trusting your judgment in this eragon saphira
for your sake and ours i hope this expedition goes ** her tone left eragon uncertain whether her words represented a heartfelt wish or a subtle threat
eragon had spent the rest of that day gathering supplies studying maps of the empire with saphira and casting what spells he felt were necessary such as one to thwart attempts by galbatorix or his minions to scry roran
the following morning eragon and roran had climbed onto saphira is back and she had taken flight rising above the orange clouds that stifled the burning plains and angling northeast
she flew nonstop until the sun had traversed the dome of the sky and extinguished itself behind the horizon and then burst forth again with a glorious conflagration of reds and yellows
the first leg of their journey carried them toward the edge of the empire which few people inhabited
there they turned west toward dras leona and helgrind
from then on they traveled at night to avoid notice by anyone in the many small villages scattered across the grasslands that lay between them and their destination
eragon and roran had to swathe themselves in cloaks and furs and wool mittens and felted hats for saphira chose to fly higher than the icebound peaks of most mountains where the air was thin and dry and stabbed at their lungs so that if a farmer tending a sick calf in the field or a sharp eyed watchman making his rounds should happen to look up as she passed overhead saphira would appear no larger than an eagle
everywhere they went eragon saw evidence of the war that was now afoot camps of soldiers wagons full of supplies gathered into a bunch for the night and lines of men with iron collars being led from their homes to fight on galbatorix is behalf
the amount of resources deployed against them was daunting indeed
near the end of the second night helgrind had appeared in the distance a mass of splintered columns vague and ominous in the ashen light that precedes dawn
saphira had landed in the hollow where they were now and they had slept through most of the past day before beginning their reconnaissance
a fountain of amber motes billowed and swirled as roran tossed a branch onto the disintegrating coals
he caught eragon is look and shrugged
cold he said
before eragon could respond he heard a slithering scraping sound akin to someone drawing a sword
he did not think he flung himself in the opposite direction rolled once and came up into a crouch lifting the hawthorn staff to deflect an oncoming blow
roran was nearly as fast
he grabbed his shield from the ground scrambled back from the log he had been sitting on and drew his hammer from his belt all in the span of a few seconds
they froze waiting for the attack
eragon is heart pounded and his muscles trembled as he searched the darkness for the slightest hint of motion
when several minutes elapsed without incident eragon pushed his mind out over the surrounding landscape
