in the midst of the verbal fray orrin pulled a scroll from his belt and said to nasuada on the matter of finances would you be so kind as to explain a rather curious item that was brought to my attention
i hold in my hand a complaint from the weavers guild which asserts that weavers throughout surda have lost a good share of their profits because the textile market has been inundated with extraordinarily cheap lace lace they swear originates with the ** a pained look crossed his face
it seems foolish to even ask but does their claim have basis in fact and if so why would the varden do such a thing
nasuada made no attempt to hide her smile
if you remember sire when you refused to lend the varden more gold you advised me to find another way for us to support ourselves
so i did
what of it asked orrin narrowing his eyes
well it struck me that while lace takes a long time to make by hand which is why it is so expensive lace is quite easy to produce using magic due to the small amount of energy involved
you of all people as a natural philosopher should appreciate that
by selling our lace here and in the empire we have been able to fully fund our efforts
the varden no longer want for food or shelter
few things in her life pleased nasuada so much as orrin is incredulous expression at that instant
the scroll frozen halfway between his chin and the table his slightly parted mouth and the quizzical frown upon his brow conspired to give him the stunned appearance of a man who had just seen something he did not understand
she savored the sight
you can not fight galbatorix withlace **
he struggled for a moment then growled because
because it is not respectable that is why
what bard would compose an epic about our deeds and write aboutlace
we do not fight in order to have epics written in our praise
then blast ** how am i supposed to answer the weavers guild by selling your lace so cheaply you hurt people is livelihoods and undermine our economy
it wo not do
it wo not do at all
letting her smile become sweet and warm nasuada said in her friendliest tone oh dear
if it is too much of a burden for your treasury the varden would be more than willing to offer you a loan in return for the kindness you ve shown us
at a suitable rate of interest of course
the council of elders managed to maintain their decorum but behind nasuada elva uttered a quick laugh of amusement
