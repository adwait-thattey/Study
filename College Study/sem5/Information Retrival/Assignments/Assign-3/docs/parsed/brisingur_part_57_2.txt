i think we just reached the jiet river said saphira
the air here is cool and moist as it would be over water
then feinster should not be much farther ahead
are you sure you can find the city in the dark we could be a hundred miles north or south of **
no we could not
my sense of direction may not be infallible but it is certainly better than yours or that of any other earthbound creature
if the elf maps we have seen were accurate then we cannot be off by more than fifty miles north or south of feinster and at this height we can easily see the city over that distance
we may even be able to smell the smoke from their chimneys
and so it was
later that night when dawn was only a few hours away a dull red glow appeared upon the western horizon
seeing it eragon twisted around and removed his armor from the saddlebags then donned his mail hauberk his arming cap his helm his bracers and his greaves
he wished he had his shield but he had left it with the varden before running to mount thardur with nar garzhvog
then eragon rummaged with one hand through the contents of his bags until he found the silver flask of faelnirv oromis had given him
the metal container was cool to the touch
eragon drank a small sip of the enchanted liqueur which seared the inside of his mouth and which tasted of elderberries and mead and mulled cider
heat suffused his face
within seconds his weariness began to recede as the restorative properties of the faelnirv took effect
eragon shook the flask
to his concern it felt as if a third of the precious liqueur was already gone even though he had only consumed a single mouthful once before
i have to be more careful with it in the future he thought
as he and saphira drew closer the glow on the horizon resolved into thousands of individual points of light from small handheld lanterns to cookfires to bonfires to huge patches of burning pitch that poured a foul black smoke into the night sky
by the ruddy light of the fires eragon saw a sea of flashing spearpoints and gleaming helmets surging against the base of the large well fortified city the walls of which teemed with tiny figures busy firing arrows at the army below pouring cauldrons of boiling oil between the merlons of the parapet cutting ropes thrown over the walls and pushing away the rickety wooden ladders the besiegers kept leaning against the ramparts
faint calls and cries floated upward from the ground as well as the boom of a battering ram crashing against the city is iron gates
the last of eragon is weariness vanished as he studied the battlefield and noted the placement of the men and the buildings and the various pieces of war machinery
extending outward from the walls of feinster were hundreds of ramshackle hovels crammed one against another with hardly enough room for a horse to pass between the dwellings of those too poor to afford a house within the main part of the city
most of the hovels appeared deserted and a wide swath had been demolished so that the varden could approach the city walls in force
a score or more of the mean huts were burning and even as he watched the fires spread leaping from one thatched roof to another
east of the hovels curved black lines scored the earth where trenches had been excavated to protect the varden is camp
on the other side of the city were docks and wharves similar to those eragon remembered from teirm and then the dark and restless ocean that seemed to extend to infinity
a thrill of feral excitement ran through eragon and he felt saphira shiver underneath him at the same time
he gripped the hilt of brisingr
they do not seem to have noticed us yet
shall we announce our arrival
saphira answered him by loosing a roar that made his teeth rattle and by painting the sky in front of them with a thick sheet of blue fire
below the varden at the foot of the city and the defenders upon the ramparts paused and for a moment silence enveloped the battlefield
then the varden began to cheer and bang their spears and swords against their shields while great groans of despair wafted from the people of the city
