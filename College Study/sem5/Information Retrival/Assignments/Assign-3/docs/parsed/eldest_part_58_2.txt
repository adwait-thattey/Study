my training wo not matter if the varden are destroyed
no
but you may be the only person who can prevent them from being destroyed for a chance exists slim but terrible that galbatorix will be present at this battle
it is far too late for our warriors to assist the varden which means that if galbatorix is indeed there you shall confront him alone without the protection of our spellweavers
under those circumstances it seemed vital that your training continue for as long as possible
in an instant eragon is anger melted away and was replaced with a cold hard and brutally practical mind set as he understood the necessity for oromis is silence
personal feelings were irrelevant in a situation as dire as theirs
with a flat voice he said you were right
my oath of fealty compels me to ensure the safety of nasuada and the varden
however i am not ready to confront galbatorix
not yet at least
my suggestion said oromis is that if galbatorix reveals himself do everything you can to distract him from the varden until the battle is decided for good or for ill and avoid directly fighting him
before you go i ask but one thing that you and saphira vow that once events permit you will return here to complete your training for you still have much to learn
we shall return pledged saphira binding herself in the ancient language
we shall return repeated eragon and sealed their fate
appearing satisfied oromis reached behind himself and produced an embroidered red pouch that he tugged open
in anticipation of your departure i gathered together three gifts for you ** from the pouch he withdrew a silver bottle
first some faelnirv i augmented with my own enchantments
this potion can sustain you when all else fails and you may find its properties useful in other circumstances as well
drink it sparingly for i only had time to prepare a few mouthfuls
he handed the bottle to eragon then removed a long black and blue sword belt from the pouch
the belt felt unusually thick and heavy to eragon when he ran it through his hands
it was made of cloth threads woven together in an interlocking pattern that depicted a coiling liani vine
at oromis is instruction eragon pulled at a tassel at the end of the belt and gasped as a strip in its center slid back to expose twelve diamonds each an inch across
four diamonds were white four were black and the remainder were red blue yellow and brown
they glittered cold and brilliant like ice in the dawn casting a rainbow of multicolored specks onto eragon is hands
master
eragon shook his head at a loss for words for several breaths
is it safe to give this to me
guard it well so that none are tempted to steal it
this is the belt of beloth the wise who you read of in your history of the year of darkness and is one of the great treasures of the riders
these are the most perfect gems the riders could find
some we traded for with the dwarves
others we won in battle or mined ourselves
the stones have no magic of their own but you may use them as repositories for your power and draw upon that reserve when in need
this in addition to the ruby set in zar roc is pommel will allow you to amass a store of energy so that you do not become unduly exhausted casting spells in battle or even when confronting enemy magicians
last oromis brought out a thin scroll protected inside a wooden tube that was decorated with a bas relief sculpture of the menoa tree
unfurling the scroll eragon saw the poem he had recited at the agaeti blodhren
it was lettered in oromis is finest calligraphy and illustrated with the elf is detailed ink paintings
plants and animals twined together inside the outline of the first glyph of each quatrain while delicate scrollwork traced the columns of words and framed the images
i thought said oromis that you would appreciate a copy for yourself
eragon stood with twelve priceless diamonds in one hand and oromis is scroll in the other and he knew that it was the scroll he deemed the most precious
eragon bowed and reduced to the simplest language by the depth of his gratitude said thank you master
