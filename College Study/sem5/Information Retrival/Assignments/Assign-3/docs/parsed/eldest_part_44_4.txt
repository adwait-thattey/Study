a dockworker laughed at horst is questions
you re too late and too early at the same time
most of the spring ships came and left two three weeks ago
an another month the nor westers will start gusting an then the seal and walrus hunters will return and we will get ships from teirm and the rest of the empire to take the hides meat and oil
then you might have a chance of hiring a captain with an empty hold
meanwhile we do not see much more traffic than this
desperate roran asked is there no other way to get goods from here to teirm it does not have to be fast or comfortable
well said the man hefting the box on his shoulder if it does not have to be fast an you re only going to teirm then you might try clovis over ** he pointed to a line of sheds that floated between two piers where boats could be stored
he owns some barges that he ships grain on in the fall
the rest of the year clovis fishes for a living like most everybody in ** then he frowned
what kind of goods do you have the sheep have already been shorn an no crops are in as of yet
this and that said horst
he tossed the man a copper
the dockworker pocketed it with a wink and a nudge
right you are sir
this an that
i know a dodge when i see one
but no need to fear old ulric mum is th word it is
be seeing you then ** he strolled off whistling
as it turned out clovis was absent from the docks
after getting directions it took them a half hour to walk to his house on the other side of narda where they found clovis planting iris bulbs along the path to his front door
he was a stout man with sunburned cheeks and a salt and pepper beard
an additional hour passed before they could convince the mariner that they really were interested in his barges despite the season and then troop back to the sheds which he unlocked to reveal three identical barges themerrybell edeline andred boar
each barge was seventy five feet long twenty feet wide and painted rust red
they had open holds that could be covered with tarpaulins a mast that could be erected in the center for a single square sail and a block of above decks cabins at the rear or aft as clovis called it of the craft
their draft be deeper than that of an inland scow explained clovis so you need not fear them capsizing in rough weather though you d do well to avoid being caught in a real tempest
these barges are not meant for the open sea
they re meant to stay within sight of land
and now be the worst time to launch them
by my honor we ve had nothing but thunderstorms every afternoon for a month
do you have crews for all three asked roran
well now
see there is a problem
most of the men i employ left weeks ago to hunt seals as they re wont to do
since i need them only after the harvest they re free to come and go as they please for the rest of the year
i am sure you fine gentlemen understand my ** clovis tried to smile then glanced between roran horst and baldor as if uncertain whom to address
roran walked the length of theedeline examining it for damage
the barge looked old but the wood was sound and the paint was fresh
if we replace the missing men in your crews how much would it cost to go to teirm with all three barges
that depends said clovis
the sailors earn fifteen coppers per day plus as much good food as they can eat and a dram of whisky besides
what your men earn be your own business
i wo not put them on my payroll
normally we also hire guards for each barge but they re
they re off hunting yes said roran
we will provide guards as well
the knob in clovis is tanned throat jumped as he swallowed
that d be more than reasonable
so it would
in addition to the crew is wages i charge a fee of two hundred crowns plus recompense for any damage to the barges on account of your men plus as both owner and captain twelve percent of the total profit from sale of the cargo
our trip will have no profit
that more than anything seemed to unnerve clovis
he rubbed the dimple in his chin with his left thumb began to talk twice stopped then finally said if that be the case another four hundred crowns upon completion of the voyage
