they were in baldor is room
roran was propped upright in bed listening as the smith said what did you expect me to do we could not attack once you fainted
besides the men were in no state to fight
ca not blame them either
i nearly bit off my tongue when i saw those ** horst shook his wild mane of hair
we ve been dragged into one of the old tales roran and i do not like it one ** roran retained his stony expression
look you can kill the soldiers if you want but you have to get your strength back first
you will have plenty of volunteers people trust you in battle especially after you defeated the soldiers here last ** when roran remained silent horst sighed patted him on his good shoulder and left the room closing the door behind him
roran did not even blink
so far in his life he had only truly cared about three things his family his home in palancar valley and katrina
his family had been annihilated last year
his farm had been smashed and burned though the land remained which was all that really mattered
a choked sob escaped past the iron lump in his throat
he was faced with a quandary that tore at his very essence the only way to rescue katrina would be to somehow pursue the ra zac and leave palancar valley yet he could not abandon carvahall to the soldiers
nor could he forget katrina
my heart or my home he thought bitterly
they were worthless without each other
if he killed the soldiers it would only prevent the ra zac and perhaps katrina from returning
anyway the slaughter would be pointless if reinforcements were nearby for their arrival would surely signal carvahall is demise
roran clenched his teeth as a fresh burst of pain emanated from his bound shoulder
he closed his ** hope sloan gets eaten like quimby
no fate could be too terrible for that traitor
roran cursed him with the blackest oaths he knew
even if i were free to leave carvahall how could i find the ra zac who would know where they live who would dare inform on galbatorix is servants despair rolled over him as he wrestled with the problem
he imagined himself in one of the great cities of the empire searching aimlessly among dirty buildings and hordes of strangers for a hint a glimpse a taste of his love
a river of tears followed as he doubled over groaning from the strength of his agony and fear
he rocked back and forth blind to anything but the desolation of the world
an endless amount of time reduced roran is sobs to weak gasps of protest
he wiped his eyes and forced himself to take a long shuddering breath
he winced
his lungs felt like they were filled with shards of glass
i have to think he told himself
he leaned against the wall and through the sheer strength of his will began to gradually subdue each of his unruly emotions wrestling them into submission to the one thing that could save him from insanity reason
his neck and shoulders trembled from the violence of his efforts
once he regained control roran carefully arranged his thoughts like a master craftsman organizing his tools into precise ** must be a solution hidden amid my knowledge if only i am creative enough
he could not track the ra zac through the air
that much was clear
someone would have to tell him where to find them and of all the people he could ask the varden probably knew the most
however they would be just as hard to find as the desecrators and he could not waste time searching for **
a small voice in his head reminded him of the rumors he had heard from trappers and traders that surda secretly supported the varden
** country lay at the bottom of the empire or so roran had been told as he had never seen a map of alagaesia
under ideal conditions it would take several weeks to reach on horse longer if he had to evade soldiers
of course the swiftest mode of transportation would be to sail south along the coast but that would mean having to travel all the way to the toark river and then to teirm to find a ship
it would take far too long
and he still might be apprehended by soldiers
if could would might he muttered repeatedly clenching his left hand
