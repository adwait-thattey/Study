i do not ** floated in place inspecting the newcomers as they spiraled around them
the creatures seemed puzzled by saphira
they darted toward her only to hiss and swoop overhead at the last moment
eragon grinned and reached out with his mind trying to touch their thoughts
as he did the three recoiled and shrieked opening their maws like hungry snakes
their piercing keen was mental as well as physical
it tore through eragon with a savage strength seeking to incapacitate him
saphira felt it too
continuing the racking cry the creatures attacked with razor claws
hold on warned saphira
she folded her left wing and spun halfway around avoiding two of the animals then flapped quickly rising above the other
at the same time eragon worked furiously to block the shriek
the instant his mind was clear he reached for the ** not kill them said ** want the experience
though the creatures were more agile than saphira she had the advantage of bulk and strength
one of the creatures dove at her
she flipped upside down falling backward and kicked the animal in the chest
the shriek dropped in intensity as her injured foe retreated
saphira flared her wings looping right side up so she faced the other two as they converged on her
she arched her neck eragon heard a deep rumble between her ribs and then a jet of flame roared from her jaws
a molten blue halo engulfed saphira is head flashing through her gemlike scales until she sparkled gloriously and seemed to be lit from within
the two dragon beasts squawked in dismay and veered to either side
the mental assault ceased as they sped away sinking back toward the mountainside
you almost threw me off said eragon loosening his cramped arms from around her neck
she looked at him ** but not quite
flushed with the thrill of victory they returned to the rafts
as saphira landed amid two great fins of water orik shouted are you hurt
no called eragon
the icy water whirled around his legs as saphira swam to the side of the raft
were they another race unique to the beors
orik pulled him onto the raft
we call them fanghur
they re not as intelligent as dragons and they can not breathe fire but they are still formidable foes
so we ** eragon massaged his temples in an attempt to alleviate the headache the fanghur is attack had brought on
saphira was more than a match for them however
it is how they hunt explained orik
they use their minds to immobilize their prey while they kill it
saphira flicked water at eragon with her ** is a good idea
maybe i will try it next time i go hunting
he ** could come in handy in a fight too
arya came to the edge of the raft
i am glad you did not kill them
fanghur are rare enough that those three would have been sorely missed
they still manage to eat enough of our herds growled thorv from inside the cabin
the dwarf marched out to eragon champing irritably under the twisted knots of his beard
do not fly anymore while in these beor mountains shadeslayer
it is difficult enough to keep you unharmed without you and thine dragon fighting wind vipers
we will stay on the ground until we reach the plains promised eragon
when they stopped for the night the dwarves moored the rafts to aspen trees along the mouth of a small stream
ama started a fire while eragon helped ekksvar pull snowfire onto land
they picketed the stallion on a strip of grass
thorv oversaw the erection of six large tents
hedin gathered firewood to last until morning and duthmer carried supplies off the second raft and began making dinner
arya took up watch on the edge of camp where she was soon joined by ekksvar ama and trihga when they finished their tasks
when eragon realized he had nothing to do he squatted by the fire with orik and shrrgnien
as shrrgnien pulled off his gloves and held his scarred hands over the flames eragon noticed that a polished steel stud perhaps a quarter of an inch long protruded from each of the dwarf is knuckles except for on his thumbs
shrrgnien looked at orik and laughed
these are mine ascudgamln
mine fists of ** without standing he twisted and punched the bole of an aspen leaving four symmetrical holes in the bark
