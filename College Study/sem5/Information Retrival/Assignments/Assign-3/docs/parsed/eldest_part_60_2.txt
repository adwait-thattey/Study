weary from the exercise he wrapped himself in blankets lay beside saphira and drifted into his waking sleep where his night phantasms played out against the sea of stars above
soon after they resumed their journey the following morning the rippling grass gave way to tan scrub which grew ever more scarce until in turn it was replaced by sunbaked ground bare of all but the most hardy plants
reddish gold dunes appeared
from his vantage on saphira they looked to eragon like lines of waves forever sailing toward a distant shore
as the sun began its descent he noticed a cluster of mountains in the distant east and knew he beheld du fells nangoroth where the wild dragons had gone to mate to raise their young and eventually to ** must visit there someday said saphira following his gaze
that night eragon felt their solitude even more keenly than before for they were camped in the emptiest region of the hadarac desert where so little moisture existed in the air that his lips soon cracked though he smeared them with nalgask every few minutes
he sensed little life in the ground only a handful of miserable plants interspersed with a few insects and lizards
as he had when they fled gil ead through the desert eragon drew water from the soil to replenish their waterskins and before he allowed the water to drain away he scryed nasuada in the pool is reflection to see if the varden had been attacked yet
to his relief they had not
on the third day since leaving ellesmera the wind rose up behind them and wafted saphira farther than she could have flown on her own carrying them entirely out of the hadarac desert
near the edge of the waste they passed over a number of horse mounted nomads who were garbed in flowing robes to ward against the heat
the men shouted in their rough tongue and shook their swords and spears at saphira though none of them dared loose an arrow at her
eragon saphira and orik bivouacked for the night at the southernmost end of silverwood forest which lay along lake tudosten and was named so because it was composed almost entirely of beeches willows and trembling poplars
in contrast to the endless twilight that lay beneath the brooding pines of du weldenvarden silverwood was filled with bright sunshine larks and the gentle rustling of green leaves
the trees seemed young and happy to eragon and he was glad to be there
and though all signs of the desert had vanished the weather remained far warmer than he was accustomed to at that time of year
it felt more like summer than spring
from there they flew straight to aberon the capital of surda guided by directions eragon gleaned from the memories of birds they encountered
saphira made no attempt to conceal herself along the way and they often heard cries of amazement and alarm from the villages she swept over
it was late afternoon when they arrived at aberon a low walled city centered around a bluff in an otherwise flat landscape
borromeo castle occupied the top of the bluff
the rambling citadel was protected by three concentric layers of walls numerous towers and eragon noted hundreds of ballistae made for shooting down a dragon
the rich amber light from the low sun cast aberon is buildings in sharp relief and illuminated a plume of dust rising from the city is western gate where a line of soldiers sought entrance
as saphira descended toward the inner ward of the castle she brought eragon into contact with the combined thoughts of the people in the capital
the noise overwhelmed him at first how was he supposed to listen for foes and still function at the same time until he realized that as usual he was concentrating too much on specifics
all he had to do was sense people is general intentions
he broadened his focus and the individual voices clamoring for his attention subsided into a continuum of the emotions surrounding him
it was like a sheet of water that lay draped over the nearby landscape undulating with the rise and fall of people is feelings and spiking whenever someone was racked by extremes of passion
