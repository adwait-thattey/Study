in times of misfortune it can house our entire nation
there have been only three instances in our history when we have been forced to that extreme but each time it has saved us from certain and utter destruction
that is why we always keep it garrisoned ready for use
i ve never seen anything as magnificent admitted eragon
orik smiled around his pipe
i am glad you find it so
it took generations to build tronjheim and our lives are much longer than those of men
unfortunately because of the cursed empire few outsiders are allowed to see its glory
humans i want to know how many have fled the empire
orik exhaled a long puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head
there are about four thousand of your kin here
but that is a poor indicator of what you want to know
only people who wish to fight come here
the rest of them are under king orrin is protection in surda
so few thought eragon with a sinking feeling
the royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand when it was fully marshaled not counting the urgals
why does not orrin fight the empire himself he asked
if he were to show open hostility said orik galbatorix would crush him
as it is galbatorix withholds that destruction because he considers surda a minor threat which is a mistake
it is through orrin is assistance that the varden have most of their weapons and supplies
without him there would be no resisting the empire
do not despair over the number of humans in tronjheim
there are many dwarves here many more than you have seen and all will fight when the time comes
orrin has also promised us troops for when we battle galbatorix
the elves pledged their help as well
eragon absently touched saphira is mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto
he noticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on orik is helm
what does that mean i saw it on the floor in tronjheim
orik lifted the iron bound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving
it is the symbol of my clan
we are the ingietum metalworkers and master smiths
the hammer and stars are inlaid into tronjheim is floor because it was the personal crest of korgan our founder
one clan to rule with twelve surrounding
king hrothgar is durgrimst ingietum as well and has brought my house much glory much honor
when they returned the platters to the cook they passed a dwarf in the hall
he stopped before eragon bowed and said respectfully argetlam
the dwarf left eragon fumbling for an answer flushed with unease yet also strangely pleased with the gesture
no one had bowed to him before
what did he say he asked leaning closer to orik
orik shrugged embarrassed
it is an elven word that was used to refer to the riders
it means isilver ** eragon glanced at his gloved hand thinking of the gedwey ignasia that whitened his palm
do you wish to return to saphira
is there somewhere i could bathe first i have not been able to wash off the grime of the road for a long time
also my shirt is bloodstained and torn and it stinks
i d like to replace it but i do not have any money to buy a new one
is there a way i could work for one
do you seek to insult hrothgar is hospitality eragon demanded orik
as long as you are in tronjheim you wo not have to buy a thing
you will pay for it in other ways ajihad and hrothgar will see to that
come
i will show you where to wash then fetch you a shirt
he took eragon down a long staircase until they were well below tronjheim
the corridors were tunnels now which cramped eragon because they were only five feet high and all the lanterns were red
so the light does not blind you when you leave or enter a dark cavern explained orik
they entered a bare room with a small door on the far side
orik pointed
the pools are through there along with brushes and soap
leave your clothes here
i will have new ones waiting when you get out
eragon thanked him and started to undress
it felt oppressive being alone underground especially with the low rock ceiling
he stripped quickly and cold hurried through the door into total darkness
he inched forward until his foot touched warm water then eased himself into it
