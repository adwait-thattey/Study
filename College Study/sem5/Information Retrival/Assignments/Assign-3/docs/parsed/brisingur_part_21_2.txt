on either side of the anvil horst is burly sons albriech and baldor alternated striking the steel with sledgehammers which they swung over their heads in huge circular blows
a makeshift forge glowed several feet behind the anvil
the hammering was so loud eragon kept his distance until albriech and baldor had finished spreading the steel and horst had returned the bar to the forge
waving his free arm horst said ho ** then he held up a finger forestalling eragon is reply and pulled a plug of felted wool out of his left ear
ah now i can hear again
what brings you about eragon while he spoke his sons scooped more charcoal into the forge from a bucket and set about tidying up the tongs hammers dies and other tools that lay on the ground
all three men gleamed with sweat
i wanted to know what was causing such a commotion said eragon
i should have guessed it was you
no one else can create as big an uproar as someone from carvahall
horst laughed his thick spade shaped beard pointed up toward the sky until his mirth was exhausted
ah that tickles my pride it does
and are not you the living truth of it eh
we all are eragon replied
you me roran everyone from carvahall
alagaesia will never be the same once the lot of us are ** he gestured at the forge and the other equipment
why are you here i thought that all the smiths were
so they are eragon
so they are
however i convinced the captain who is in charge of this part of the camp to let me work closer to our ** horst tugged at the end of his beard
it is on account of elain you know
this child it goes hard with her and no wonder considering what we went through to get here
she is always been delicate and now i worry that
well
he shook himself like a bear ridding itself of flies
maybe you could look in on her when you get a chance and see if you can ease her discomfort
with a satisfied grunt horst lifted the bar partway out of the coals to better judge the color of the steel
plunging the bar back into the center of the fire he jerked his beard toward albriech
here now give it some air
it is almost ** as albriech began to pump the leather bellows horst grinned at eragon
when i told the varden i was a smith they were so happy you would have thought i was another dragon rider
they do not have enough metal workers you see
and they gave me what tools i was missing including that anvil
when we left carvahall i wept at the prospect that i would not have the opportunity to practice my craft again
i am no swordsmith but here ah here there is enough work to keep albriech baldor and me busy for the next fifty years
it does not pay very well but at least we re not stretched out on a rack in gal batorix is dungeons
or the ra zac could be nibbling on our bones observed baldor
aye that ** horst motioned for his sons to take up the sledgehammers again and then holding the felt plug beside his left ear said is there anything else you wish of us eragon the steel is ready and i cannot leave it in the fire any longer without weakening it
do you know where gedric is
gedric the furrow between horst is eyebrows deepened
he should be practicing the sword and spear along with the rest of the men thataway about a quarter of a ** horst pointed with a thumb
eragon thanked him and departed in the direction horst had indicated
the repetitive ring of metal striking metal resumed clear as the peals of a bell and as sharp and piercing as a glass needle stabbing the air
eragon covered his ears and smiled
it comforted him that horst had retained his strength of purpose and that despite the loss of his wealth and home he was still the same person he had been in carvahall
somehow the smith is consistency and resiliency renewed eragon is faith that if only they could overthrow galbatorix everything would be all right in the end and his life and those of the villagers from carvahall would regain a semblance of normalcy
eragon soon arrived at the field where the men of carvahall were drilling with their new weapons
gedric was there as horst had suggested he would be sparring with fisk darmmen and morn
