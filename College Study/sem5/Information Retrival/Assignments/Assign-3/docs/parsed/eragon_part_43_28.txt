after a spear downed one of his warriors hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and with astounding strength hurled it completely through its owner twenty yards away
such heroism emboldened eragon to ever greater risks seeking to hold his own with the mighty king
eragon lunged at a giant kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from saphira is saddle
before he could recover the kull darted past saphira is defenses and swung his sword
the brunt of the blow caught eragon on the side of his helm throwing him backward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring thunderously
stunned he tried to pull himself upright but the kull had already prepared for another blow
as the kull is arm descended a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from his chest
howling the monster toppled to the side
in his place stood angela
the witch wore a long red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green
she bore a strange two handed weapon a long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to each end
angela winked at eragon mischievously then dashed away spinning her staff sword like a dervish
close behind her was solembum in the form of a young shaggy haired boy
he held a small black dagger sharp teeth bared in a feral snarl
still dazed from his battering eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle
saphira jumped into the air and wheeled high above letting him recuperate
he scanned farthen dur is plains and saw to his dismay that all three battles were going badly
neither ajihad jormundur nor hrothgar could stop the urgals
there were simply too many
eragon wondered how many urgals he could kill at once with magic
he knew his limits fairly well
if he were to kill enough to make a difference
it would probably be suicide
that might be what it took to win
the fighting continued for one endless hour after another
the varden and dwarves were exhausted but the urgals remained fresh with reinforcements
it was a nightmare for eragon
though he and saphira fought their hardest there was always another urgal to take the place of the one just killed
his whole body hurt especially his head
every time he used magic he lost a little more energy
saphira was in better condition though her wings were punctured with small wounds
as he parried a blow the twins contacted him ** are loud noises under tronjheim
it sounds like urgals are trying to dig into the ** we need you and arya to collapse any tunnels they re excavating
eragon dispatched his opponent with a sword ** will be right there
he looked for arya and saw her engaged with a knot of struggling urgals
saphira quickly forged a path to the elf leaving a pile of crumpled bodies in her wake
eragon extended his hand and said get **
arya jumped onto saphira is back without hesitation
she wrapped her right arm around eragon is waist wielding her bloodstained sword with the other
as saphira crouched to take off an urgal ran at her howling then lifted an ax and smashed her in the chest
saphira roared with pain and lurched forward feet leaving the ground
her wings snapped open straining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side right wingtip scraping the ground
below them the urgal pulled back his arm to throw the ax
but arya raised her palm shouting and an emerald ball of energy shot from her hand killing the urgal
with a colossal heave of her shoulders saphira righted herself barely making it over the heads of the warriors
she pulled away from the battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath
are you all right asked eragon concerned
he could not see where she had been struck
i will live she said grimly but the front of my armor has been crushed ** hurts my chest and i am having trouble moving
can you get us to the dragonhold
eragon explained saphira is condition to arya
i will stay and help saphira when we land she offered
once she is free of the armor i will join you
thank you he said
the flight was laborious for saphira she glided whenever she could
when they reached the dragonhold she dropped heavily to isidar mithrim where the twins were supposed to be watching the battle but it was empty
