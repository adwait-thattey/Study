brisingr was a fun intense and sometimes difficult book to write
when i started i felt as if the story were a vast three dimensional puzzle that i had to solve without hints or instructions
i found the experience to be immensely satisfying despite the challenges it occasionally posed
because of its complexity brisingr ended up much larger than i anticipated so much larger in fact that i had to expand the series from three books to four
thus the inheritance trilogy became the inheritance cycle
i am pleased with the change too
having another volume in the series has allowed me to explore and develop the characters personalities and relationships at a more natural pace
as with eragon and eldest i never would have been able to complete this book without the support of a whole host of talented people to whom i am ever grateful
they are
once again eragon and saphira is adventures are over and once again we have arrived at the end of this wandering path
but only for the time being
many more miles still lie before us
book four will be published just as soon as i can finish it and i can promise you it is going to be the most exciting installment in the series
i can not wait for you to read it
