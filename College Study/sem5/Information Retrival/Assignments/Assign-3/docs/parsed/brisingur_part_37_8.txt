eragon stood and loosened his borrowed sword in its sheath drawing it out a half inch so he could respond with all possible speed if vermund or one of his dwarves chose that moment to attack
vermund did not move however nor did orik they stared at each other like rival wolves and paid no attention to the commotion around them
when at last gannel succeeded in restoring order he said grimstborith vermund can you refute these charges
in a flat emotionless voice vermund replied i deny them with every bone in my body and i challenge anyone to prove them to the satisfaction of a reader of law
gannel turned toward orik
present your evidence then grimstborith orik that we may judge whether it is valid or not
there are five readers of law here today if i am not ** he motioned toward the wall where five white bearded dwarves stood and bowed
they will ensure that we do not stray beyond the boundaries of the law in our investigation
are we agreed
i am agreed said hadfala and all the rest of the clan chiefs after her save vermund
first orik placed the amethyst bracelet upon the table
every clan chief had one of their magicians examine it and all agreed that as evidence it was inconclusive
then orik had an aide bring in a mirror mounted on a bronze tripod
one of the magicians within his retinue cast a spell and upon the glossy surface of the mirror there appeared the image of a small book filled room
a moment passed and then a dwarf rushed into the room and bowed toward the clanmeet from within the mirror
in a breathless voice he introduced himself as rimmar and after swearing oaths in the ancient language to ensure his honesty he told the clanmeet how he and his assistants had made their discoveries concerning the daggers eragon is attackers had wielded
when the clan chiefs finished questioning rimmar orik had his warriors bring in the three dwarves the ingeitum had captured
gannel ordered them to swear the oaths of truthfulness in the ancient language but they cursed at him and spat on the floor and refused
then magicians from all of the different clans joined their thoughts invaded the prisoners minds and wrested from them the information the clanmeet desired
without exception the magicians confirmed what orik had already said
lastly orik called upon eragon to testify
eragon felt nervous as he walked over to the table and the thirteen grim clan chiefs stared at him
he gazed across the room at a small whorl of color on a marble pillar and tried to ignore his discomfort
he repeated the oaths of truthfulness as one of the dwarf magicians gave them to him and then speaking no more than was necessary eragon told the clan chiefs how he and his guards had been attacked
afterward he answered the dwarves inevitable questions and then allowed two of the magicians whom gannel chose at random from among those assembled to examine his memories of the event
as eragon lowered the barriers around his mind he noted that the two magicians appeared apprehensive and he drew some comfort from the observation
good he thought
they will be less likely to wander where they should not if they fear me
to eragon is relief the inspection went without incident and the magicians corroborated his account to the clan chiefs
gannel rose from his chair and addressed the readers of law asking them are you satisfied with the quality of the evidence grimstborith orik and eragon shadeslayer have shown us
the five white bearded dwarves bowed and the middle dwarf said we are grimstborith gannel
gannel grunted seeming unsurprised
grimstborith vermund you are responsible for the death of kvistor son of bauden and you attempted to kill a guest
by doing so you have brought shame upon our entire race
what say you to this
the clan chief of az sweldn rak anhuin pressed his hands flat against the table veins bulging underneath his tanned skin
if this dragon rider is a knurla in all but blood then he is no guest and we may treat him as we would any of our enemies from a different clan
why that is ** exclaimed orik almost sputtering with outrage
