the sun had set by the time dinner was served
a blustery wind howled outside shaking the house
eragon eyed roran closely and waited for the inevitable
finally i was offered a job at therinsford is mill
which i plan to take
garrow finished his mouthful of food with deliberate slowness and laid down his fork
he leaned back in his chair then interlaced his fingers behind his head and uttered one dry word why
roran explained while eragon absently picked at his food
i see was garrow is only comment
he fell silent and stared at the ceiling
no one moved as they awaited his response
well when do you leave
garrow leaned forward with a twinkle in his eye
did you think i would stop you i d hoped you would marry soon
it will be good to see this family growing again
katrina will be lucky to have ** astonishment raced over roran is face then he settled into a relieved grin
so when do you leave garrow asked
roran regained his voice
when dempton returns to get the sockets for the mill
garrow nodded
and that will be in
good
that will give us time to prepare
it will be different to have the house to ourselves
but if nothing goes amiss it should not be for too ** he looked over the table and asked eragon did you know of this
he shrugged ruefully
not until today
it is madness
garrow ran a hand over his face
it is life is natural ** he pushed himself up from the chair
all will be fine time will settle everything
for now though let is clean the ** eragon and roran helped him in silence
the next few days were trying
eragon is temper was frayed
except for curtly answering direct questions he spoke with no one
there were small reminders everywhere that roran was leaving garrow making him a pack things missing from the walls and a strange emptiness that filled the house
it was almost a week before he realized that distance had grown between roran and him
when they spoke the words did not come easily and their conversations were uncomfortable
saphira was a balm for eragon is frustration
he could talk freely with her his emotions were completely open to her mind and she understood him better than anyone else
during the weeks before roran is departure she went through another growth spurt
she gained twelve inches at the shoulder which was now higher than eragon is
he found that the small hollow where her neck joined her shoulders was a perfect place to sit
he often rested there in the evenings and scratched her neck while he explained the meanings of different words
soon she understood everything he said and frequently commented on it
for eragon this part of his life was delightful
saphira was as real and complex as any person
her personality was eclectic and at times completely alien yet they understood each other on a profound level
her actions and thoughts constantly revealed new aspects of her character
once she caught an eagle and instead of eating it released it saying no hunter of the sky should end his days as prey
better to die on the wing than pinned to the ground
eragon is plan to let his family see saphira was dispelled by roran is announcement and saphira is own cautionary words
she was reluctant to be seen and he partly out of selfishness agreed
the moment her existence was divulged he knew that shouts accusations and fear would be directed at him
so he procrastinated
he told himself to wait for a sign that it was the right time
the night before roran was to leave eragon went to talk with him
he stalked down the hallway to roran is open door
an oil lamp rested on a nightstand painting the walls with warm flickering light
the bedposts cast elongated shadows on empty shelves that rose to the ceiling
roran his eyes shaded and the back of his neck tense was rolling blankets around his clothes and belongings
he paused then picked up something from the pillow and bounced it in his hand
it was a polished rock eragon had given him years ago
roran started to tuck it into the bundle then stopped and set it on a shelf
a hard lump formed in eragon is throat and he left
