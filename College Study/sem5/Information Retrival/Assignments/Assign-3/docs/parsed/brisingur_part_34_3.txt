do you think our ruse was discovered nasuada asked from her high backed chair
blodhgarm bowed with an elegant gesture
again lady nasuada i cannot say for sure
we will have to wait and see if the empire moves to take advantage of eragon is absence before we will know the answer to that question
thank you blodhgarm
that will be all
with another bow the elf withdrew from the tent and took up a position several yards behind saphira guarding her flank
saphira settled down onto her underside and began to lick clean the scales around the third claw on her left forefoot between which there had accumulated unsightly lines of the dry white clay she remembered standing in when she ate her last kill
not a minute later martland redbeard roran and a man with round ears whom she did not recognize entered the red tent and bowed to nasuada
saphira paused in her cleaning to taste the air with her tongue and discerned the tang of dried blood the bitter sour musk of sweat the scent of horse and leather intermingled and faint but unmistakable the sharp spike of man fear
she examined the trio again and saw that the red long beard man had lost his right hand then returned to excavating the clay from around her scales
she continued licking her foot restoring every scale to pristine brilliance while first martland then the man with round ears who was ulhart then roran told a tale of blood and fire and of laughing men who refused to die at their allotted times but insisted upon continuing to fight long past when angvard had called their names
as was her wont saphira held her peace while others specifically nasuada and her adviser long man gaunt face jormundur questioned the warriors about the details of their ill fated mission
saphira knew it sometimes puzzled eragon why she did not participate more in conversations
her reasons for silence were simple save for arya or glaedr she felt most comfortable communicating only with eragon and in her opinion most conversations were nothing more than pointless dithering
whether round ear pointed ear horned or short two legs seemed addicted to dithering
brom had not dithered which was something saphira had liked about him
for her choices were simple either there was an action she could take to improve the situation in which case she took it or there was not and everything else said on the subject was so much meaningless noise
in any event she did not worry herself about the future except where eragon was concerned
him she always worried about
when the questions were finished nasuada expressed her condolences to martland for his lost hand then dismissed martland and ulhart but not roran to whom she said you have demonstrated your prowess once again stronghammer
i am well pleased with your abilities
our best healers will attend to him but martland will still need time to recover from his injury
even once he does he cannot lead raids such as these with only one hand
from now on he will have to serve the varden from the back of the army not the front
i think perhaps that i shall promote him and make him one of my battle advisers
jormundur what think you of that idea
i think it an excellent idea my lady
nasuada nodded appearing satisfied
this means however that i must find another captain for you to serve under roran
then roran said my lady what of my own command have i not proven myself to your satisfaction with these two raids as well as with my past accomplishments
if you continue to distinguish yourself as you have strong hammer you will win your command soon enough
however you must be patient and abide awhile longer
two missions alone however impressive may not reveal the full scope of a man is character
i am a cautious person when it comes to entrusting my people to others stronghammer
in this you must humor me
roran gripped the head of the hammer stuck through his belt veins and tendons standing out on his hand but his tone remained polite
of course lady nasuada
very good
a page will bring you your new assignment later today
oh and see to it that you have a large meal once you and katrina finish celebrating your reunion
