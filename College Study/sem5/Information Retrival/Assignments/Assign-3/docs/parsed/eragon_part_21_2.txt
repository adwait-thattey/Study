with a puff of feathers the crow fell over backward the arrow protruding from its chest
eragon fit another arrow to the string but nausea rose from his stomach and he threw up over cadoc is side
brom patted him on the back
when eragon was done brom asked gently do you want to wait for me outside yazuac
no
i will stay said eragon shakily wiping his mouth
he avoided looking at the gruesome sight before them
who could have done
he could not force out the words
brom bowed his head
those who love the pain and suffering of others
they wear many faces and go by many disguises but there is only one name for them evil
there is no understanding it
all we can do is pity and honor the victims
he dismounted snowfire and walked around inspecting the trampled ground carefully
the ra zac passed this way he said slowly but this was not their doing
this is urgal work the spear is of their make
a company of them came through here perhaps as many as a hundred
it is odd i know of only a few instances when they have gathered in such
he knelt and examined a footprint intently
with a curse he ran back to snowfire and leapt onto him
** he hissed tightly spurring snowfire forward
there are still urgals ** eragon jammed his heels into cadoc
the horse jumped forward and raced after snowfire
they dashed past the houses and were almost to the edge of yazuac when eragon is palm tingled again
he saw a flicker of movement to his right then a giant fist smashed him out of the saddle
he flew back over cadoc and crashed into a wall holding on to his bow only by instinct
gasping and stunned he staggered upright hugging his side
an urgal stood over him face set in a gross leer
the monster was tall thick and broader than a doorway with gray skin and yellow piggish eyes
muscles bulged on his arms and chest which was covered by a too small breastplate
an iron cap rested over the pair of ram is horns curling from his temples and a roundshield was bound to one arm
his powerful hand held a short wicked sword
behind him eragon saw brom rein in snowfire and start back only to be stopped by the appearance of a second urgal this one with an ax
run you ** brom cried to eragon cleaving at his enemy
the urgal in front of eragon roared and swung his sword mightily
eragon jerked back with a startled yelp as the weapon whistled past his cheek
he spun around and fled toward the center of yazuac heart pounding wildly
the urgal pursued him heavy boots thudding
eragon sent a desperate cry for help to saphira then forced himself to go even faster
the urgal rapidly gained ground despite eragon is efforts large fangs separated in a soundless bellow
with the urgal almost upon him eragon strung an arrow spun to a stop took aim and released
the urgal snapped up his arm and caught the quivering bolt on his shield
the monster collided with eragon before he could shoot again and they fell to the ground in a confused tangle
eragon sprang to his feet and rushed back to brom who was trading fierce blows with his opponent from snowfire is ** are the rest of the urgals wondered eragon ** these two the only ones in yazuac there was a loud smack and snowfire reared whinnying
brom doubled over in his saddle blood streaming down his arm
the urgal beside him howled in triumph and raised his ax for the death blow
a deafening scream tore out of eragon as he charged the urgal headfirst
the urgal paused in astonishment then faced him contemptuously swinging his ax
eragon ducked under the two handed blow and clawed the urgal is side leaving bloody furrows
the urgal is face twisted with rage
he slashed again but missed as eragon dived to the side and scrambled down an alley
eragon concentrated on leading the urgals away from brom
he slipped into a narrow passageway between two houses saw it was a dead end and slid to a stop
he tried to back out but the urgals had already blocked the entrance
they advanced cursing him in their gravelly voices
eragon swung his head from side to side searching for a way out but there was none
as he faced the urgals images flashed in his mind dead villagers piled around the spear and an innocent baby who would never grow to adulthood
