she did not use the ancient language observed eragon
he noticed that while everyone was occupied by the flowers islanzadi touched arya gently on the shoulder and murmured almost too softly to hear you never would have suffered so if you had taken my counsel
i was right to oppose your decision to accept the yawe
it was my decision to make
the queen paused then nodded and extended her arm
** with a flutter of wings the raven flew from his perch and landed on her left shoulder
the entire assembly bowed as islanzadi proceeded to the end of the hall and threw open the door to the hundreds of elves outside whereupon she made a brief declaration in the ancient language that eragon did not understand
the elves burst into cheers and began to rush about
what did she say whispered eragon to nari
nari smiled
to break open our finest casks and light the cook fires for tonight shall be a night of feast and song
** he grabbed eragon is hand and pulled him after the queen as she threaded her way between the shaggy pines and through banks of cool ferns
during their time indoors the sun had dropped low in the sky drenching the forest with an amber light that clung to the trees and plants like a layer of glistering oil
you do realize do not you said saphira that the king lifaen mentioned evandar must be arya is father
eragon almost ** re right
and that means he was killed by either galbatorix or the forsworn
they stopped on the crest of a small hill where a team of elves had set out a long trestle table and chairs
all around them the forest hummed with activity
as evening approached the cheery glow of fires appeared scattered throughout ellesmera including a bonfire near the table
someone handed eragon a goblet made of the same odd wood that he had noticed in ceris
he drank the cup is clear liqueur and gasped as it blazed down his throat
it tasted like mulled cider mixed with mead
the potion made the tips of his fingers and ears tingle and gave him a marvelous sense of clarity
what is this he asked nari
nari laughed
faelnirv we distill it from crushed elderberries and spun moonbeams
if he needs must a strong man can travel for three days on naught else
saphira you have to taste ** sniffed the goblet then opened her mouth and allowed him to pour the rest of the faelnirv down her throat
her eyes widened and her tail twitched
now that is a ** is there more
before eragon could reply orik stomped over to them
daughter to the queen he grumbled shaking his head
i wish that i could tell hrothgar and nasuada
they d want to know
islanzadi seated herself in a high backed chair and clapped her hands once again
from within the city came a quartet of elves bearing musical instruments
two had harps of cherrywood the third a set of reed pipes and the fourth nothing but her voice which she immediately put to use with a playful song that danced about their ears
eragon caught only every third word or so but what he did understand made him grin
it was the story of a stag who could not drink at a pond because a magpie kept harassing him
as eragon listened his gaze wandered and alighted upon a small girl prowling behind the queen
when he looked again he saw that her shaggy hair was not silver like many of the elves but bleached white with age and that her face was creased and lined like a dry withered apple
she was no elf nor dwarf nor eragon felt even human
she smiled at him and he glimpsed rows of sharp teeth
when the singer finished and the pipes and lutes filled the silence eragon found himself approached by scores of elves who wished to meet him and more importantly he sensed saphira
the elves presented themselves by bowing softly and touching their lips with their first and middle fingers to which eragon responded in kind along with endless repetitions of their greeting in the ancient language
they plied eragon with polite questions about his exploits but they reserved the bulk of their conversation for saphira
at first eragon was content to let saphira talk since this was the first place where anyone was interested in having a discussion just with her
