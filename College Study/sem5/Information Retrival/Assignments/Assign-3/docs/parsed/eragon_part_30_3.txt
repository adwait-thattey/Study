i will be gone until late tonight
coins for food are under the mattress
explore the city enjoy yourself butstay **
**
avoid the palace
do not go anywhere without your ** keep it strung
eragon wiped the wall clean then retrieved the money from under the bed
he slipped the bow across his back thinking i wish i did not have to go armed all the time
he left the golden globe and ambled through the streets stopping to observe whatever interested him
there were many intriguing stores but none quite as exciting as angela is herb shop in teirm
at times he glared at the dark claustrophobic houses and wished that he were free of the city
when he grew hungry he bought a wedge of cheese and a loaf of bread and ate them sitting on a curb
later in a far corner of dras leona he heard an auctioneer rattling off a list of prices
curious he headed toward the voice and arrived at a wide opening between two buildings
ten men stood on a waist high platform
arrayed before them was a richly dressed crowd that was both colorful and ** are the goods for sale wondered eragon
the auctioneer finished his list and motioned for a young man behind the platform to join him
the man awkwardly climbed up chains dragging at his hands and feet
and here we have our first item proclaimed the auctioneer
a healthy male from the hadarac desert captured just last month and in excellent condition
look at those arms and legs he is strong as a ** he d be perfect as a shield bearer or if you do not trust him for that hard labor
but let me tell you lords and ladies that would be a waste
he is bright as a nail if you can get him to talk a civilized **
the crowd laughed and eragon ground his teeth with fury
his lips started to form a word that would free the slave and his arm newly liberated from the splint rose
the mark on his palm shimmered
he was about to release the magic when it struck him he d never get ** the slave would be caught before he reached the city walls
eragon would only make the situation worse if he tried to help
he lowered his arm and quietly ** this is how you got into trouble with the urgals
he watched helplessly as the slave was sold to a tall hawk nosed man
the next slave was a tiny girl no more than six years old wrenched from the arms of her crying mother
as the auctioneer started the bidding eragon forced himself to walk away rigid with fury and outrage
it was several blocks before the weeping was ** d like to see a thief try to cut my purse right now he thought grimly almost wishing it would happen
frustrated he punched a nearby wall bruising his knuckles
that is the sort of thing i could stop by fighting the empire he realized
with saphira by my side i could free those slaves
i ve been graced with special powers it would be selfish of me not to use them for the benefit of others
if i do not i might as well not be a rider at all
it was a while before he took stock of his bearings and was surprised to find himself before the cathedral
its twisted spires were covered with statues and scrollwork
snarling gargoyles crouched along the eaves
fantastic beasts writhed on the walls and heroes and kings marched along their bottom edges frozen in cold marble
ribbed arches and tall stained glass windows lined the cathedral is sides along with columns of differing sizes
a lonely turret helmed the building like a mast
recessed in shadow at the cathedral is front was an iron bound door inlaid with a row of silver script that eragon recognized as the ancient language
as best he could tell it read may thee who enter here understand thine impermanence and forget thine attachments to that which is beloved
the entire building sent a shiver down eragon is spine
there was something menacing about it as if it were a predator crouched in the city waiting for its next victim
a broad row of steps led to the cathedral is entrance
eragon solemnly ascended them and stopped before the ** wonder if i can go in almost guiltily he pushed on the door
it swung open smoothly gliding on oiled hinges
he stepped inside
the silence of a forgotten tomb filled the empty cathedral
