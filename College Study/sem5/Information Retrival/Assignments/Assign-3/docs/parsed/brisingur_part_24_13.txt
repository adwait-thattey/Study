your cousin eragon begged me to allow him to take part in today is fighting
i refused on account of his impending marriage which pleased him not although i suspect his betrothed feels otherwise
would you do me the favor of notifying me if they still intend to proceed with the ceremony today after so much bloodshed it would hearten the varden to attend a marriage
i will let you know as soon as i find out
thank you
you may go now eragon
only then did he and saphira seek out roran
blodhgarm and his elves accompanied them arya left to attend to business of her own
roran and katrina were arguing quietly and intensely when eragon spotted them standing by the corner of horst is tent
they fell silent as eragon and saphira drew near
katrina crossed her arms and stared away from roran while roran gripped the top of his hammer thrust through his belt and scuffed the heel of his boot against a rock
stopping in front of them eragon waited a few moments hoping they would explain the reason for their quarrel but instead katrina said are either of you injured her eyes flicked from him to saphira and back
that is so
strange
we heard tales of magic in carvahall but i never really believed them
they seemed so impossible
but here there are magicians everywhere
did you wound murtagh and thorn badly is that why they fled
we bested them but we caused them no permanent ** eragon paused and when neither roran nor katrina spoke he asked if they still wanted to get married that day
nasuada suggested you proceed but it might be better to wait
the dead have yet to be buried and there is much that needs doing
tomorrow would be more convenient
and more seemly
no said roran and ground the tip of his boot against the rock
the empire could attack again at any moment
tomorrow might be too late
if
if somehow i died before we were wed what would become of katrina or our
he faltered and his cheeks reddened
her expression softening katrina turned to roran and took his hand
she said besides the food has been cooked the decorations have been hung and our friends have gathered for our marriage
it would be a pity if all those preparations were for ** reaching up she stroked roran is beard and he smiled at her and placed an arm around her
i do not understand half of what goes on between them eragon complained to saphira
when shall the ceremony take place then
