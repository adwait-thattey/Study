then saphira snarled and every bird within hearing fled in fright
enough of this ** she declared
i am a dragon and i will not be ignored not even by a tree
no ** eragon cried sensing her intentions but she ignored him
stepping back from the trunk of the menoa tree saphira crouched sank her claws deep into the root underneath her and with a mighty wrench tore three huge strips of wood out of the root
come out and speak with us elf ** she roared
she drew back her head like a snake about to strike and a pillar of flame erupted from between her jaws bathing the trunk in a storm of blue and white fire
covering his face eragon leaped away to escape the heat
i will stop when she answers us
a thick cloud of water droplets fell to the ground
looking up eragon saw the branches of the pine trembling and swaying with increasing agitation
the groan of wood rubbing against wood filled the air
at the same time an ice cold breeze struck eragon is cheek and he thought he felt a low rumble beneath his feet
glancing around he saw that the trees that ringed the clearing seemed taller and more angular than before and they seemed to be leaning inward their crooked branches reaching toward him like talons
saphira
he said and sank into a half crouch ready to either run or fight
closing her jaws and thus ending the stream of fire saphira looked away from the menoa tree
as she beheld the ring of menacing trees her scales rippled and the tips rose from her hide like the ruff on a riled cat
she growled at the forest swinging her head from side to side then unfolded her wings and began to retreat from the menoa tree
quick get on my back
before eragon could take a single step a root as thick as his arm sprouted out of the ground and coiled itself around his left ankle immobilizing him
even thicker roots appeared on either side of saphira and grasped her by the legs and tail holding her in place
saphira roared in fury and arched her neck to loose another deluge of fire
the flames in her mouth flickered and went out as a voice sounded in her mind and eragon is a slow whispering voice that reminded eragon of rustling leaves and the voice said who dares to disturb my peace who dares to bite me and burn me name yourselves so i will know who it is i have killed
eragon grimaced in pain as the root tightened around his ankle
a little more pressure and it would break the bone
i am eragon shadeslayer and this is the dragon with whom i am bonded saphira brightscales
die well eragon shadeslayer and saphira brightscales
** eragon said
i have not finished naming us
a long silence followed then the voice said continue
i am the last free dragon rider in alagaesia and saphira is the last female dragon in all of existence
we are perhaps the only ones who can defeat galbatorix the traitor who has destroyed the riders and conquered half of alagaesia
why did you hurt me dragon the voice sighed
saphira bared her teeth as she answered because you would not talk with us elf tree and because eragon has lost his sword and a werecat told him to look under the menoa tree when he needed a weapon
we have looked and looked but we cannot find it on our own
then you die in vain dragon for there is no weapon under my roots
desperate to keep the tree talking eragon said we believe the werecat might have meant brightsteel the star metal rhunon uses to forge the blades of the riders
without it she cannot replace my sword
the surface of the earth rippled as the network of roots that covered the clearing shifted slightly
the disturbance flushed hundreds of panicked rabbits mice voles shrews and other small creatures from their burrows and dens and sent them scampering across the open ground toward the main body of the forest
out of the corner of his eye eragon saw dozens of elves running toward the clearing their hair streaming behind them like silk pennants
silent as apparitions the elves stopped underneath the boughs of the encircling trees and stared at him and saphira but made no move to approach or to assist them
eragon was about to call with his mind for oromis and glaedr when the voice returned
