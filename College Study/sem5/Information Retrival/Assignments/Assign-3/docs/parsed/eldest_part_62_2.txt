i do not boast when i say these are no mean accomplishments
and i am certain i can continue to produce such results
why then does nasuada want to depose me how have i displeased her
everything became clear to eragon ** has grown accustomed to power and does not want to surrender it
but more than that she thinks that my replacing her is a criticism of her leadership
you need to resolve this debate and quickly too said ** time grows short
eragon racked his brain for a way to establish his authority in du vrangr gata without further alienating trianna
at last he said i did not come here to stir up trouble
i came to ask for your ** he spoke to the entire congregation but looked only at the sorceress
i am strong yes
saphira and i could probably defeat any number of galbatorix is pet magicians
but we cannot protect everyone in the varden
we cannotbe everywhere
and if the empire is battle mages join forces against us then even we will be hard pressed to survive
we cannot fight this battle alone
you are quite right trianna you have done well with du vrangr gata and i am not here to usurp your authority
it is only that as a magician i need to work with du vrangr gata and as a rider i may also need to give you orders orders that i have to know will be obeyed without question
the chain of command must be established
that said you will retain the greater part of your autonomy
most times i will be too busy to devote my attention to du vrangr gata
nor do i intend to ignore your counsel for i am aware that you have far more experience than i
so i ask again will you help us for the good of the varden
trianna paused then bowed
of course shadeslayer for the good of the varden
it will be an honor to have you lead du vrangr gata
over the next few hours eragon talked with every one of the assembled magicians although a fair number were absent being occupied with one task or another to help the varden
he did his best to acquaint himself with their knowledge of magic
he learned that the majority of men and women in du vrangr gata had been introduced to their craft by a relative and usually in profound secrecy to avoid attracting attention from those who feared magic and of course galbatorix himself
only a handful had received proper apprenticeships
as a result most of the spellcasters knew little about the ancient language none could truly speak it fluently their beliefs about magic were often distorted by religious superstitions and they were ignorant of numerous applications of gramarye
no wonder the twins were so desperate to extract your vocabulary of the ancient language when they tested you in farthen dur observed ** it they could have easily conquered these lesser magicians
they re all we have to work with though
true
i hope you can see now i was right about trianna
she places her own desires before the good of the many
you were right he ** i do not condemn her for it
trianna deals with the world in the best way she can as do we all
i understand that even if i do not approve and understanding as oromis said breeds empathy
a bit more than a third of the spellcasters specialized as healers
those eragon sent on their way after giving them a quintet of new spells to memorize enchantments that would allow them to treat a greater range of injuries
the remaining spellcasters eragon worked with to establish a clear chain of command he appointed trianna his lieutenant and let her ensure that his orders were carried out and to weld their disparate personalities into a cohesive fighting unit
trying to convince magicians to cooperate he discovered was like trying to get a pack of dogs to share a meat bone
nor did it help that they were in evident awe of him for he could find no way of using his influence to smooth relations among the contentious magicians
in order to gain a better idea of their exact proficiency eragon had them cast a series of spells
as he watched them struggle with enchantments that he now considered simple eragon became aware of just how far his own powers had advanced
to saphira he marveled and to think i once had trouble lifting a pebble in the air
