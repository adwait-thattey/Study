one of the men eragon met had lost his left leg below the knee as well as two fingers on his right hand
his beard was short and gray and his eyes were covered with a strip of black cloth
when eragon greeted him and asked how he fared the man reached out and grasped eragon by the elbow with the three fingers of his right hand
in a hoarse voice the man said ah shadeslayer
i knew you would come
i have been waiting for you ever since the light
the light that illuminated the flesh of the world
in a single instant i saw every living thing around me from the largest to the smallest
i saw my bones shining through my arms
i saw the worms in the earth and the gore crows in the sky and the mites on the wings of the crows
the gods have touched me shadeslayer
they gave me this vision for a reason
i saw you on the field of battle you and your dragon and you were like a blazing sun among a forest of dim candles
and i saw your brother your brother and his dragon and they too were like a sun
the nape of eragon is neck prickled as he listened
i have no brother he said
the maimed swordsman cackled
you cannot fool me shade slayer
i know better
the world burns around me and from the fire i hear the whisper of minds and i learn things from the whispers
you hide yourself from me now but i can still see you a man of yellow flame with twelve stars floating around your waist and another star brighter than the others upon your right hand
eragon pressed his palm against the belt of beloth the wise checking that the twelve diamonds sewn within were still concealed
they were
listen to me shadeslayer whispered the man pulling eragon toward his lined face
i saw your brother and he burned
but he did not burn like you
oh no
the light from his soul shone through him as if it came from somewhere else
he he was a void a shape of a man
and through that shape came the brilliance that burned
do you understand others illuminated him
where were these others did you see them as well
the warrior hesitated
i could feel them close at hand raging at the world as if they hated everything in it but their bodies were hidden from my sight
they were there and not there
i cannot explain better than that
i would not want to get any closer to those creatures shadeslayer
they are not human of that i am sure and their hate it was like the largest thunderstorm you ve ever seen crammed into a tiny glass bottle
and when the bottle breaks
eragon murmured
exactly shadeslayer
sometimes i wonder if galbatorix has managed to capture the gods themselves and make them his slaves but then i laugh and call myself a fool
whose gods though the dwarves those of the wandering tribes
does it matter shadeslayer a god is a god regardless of where he comes from
as he left the man is pallet one of the healers pulled eragon aside
she said forgive him my lord
the shock of his wounds has driven him quite mad
he is always ranting about suns and stars and glowing lights he claims to see
sometimes it seems as if he knows things he should not but do not you be deceived he gets them from the other patients
they gossip all the time you know
it is all they have to do poor things
i am not a lord eragon said and he is not mad
i am not sure what he is but he has an uncommon ability
if he gets better or worse please inform one of du vrangr gata
the healer curtsied
as you wish shadeslayer
i am sorry for my mistake shadeslayer
a soldier cut off his fingers when he tried to block a sword with his hand
later one of the missiles from the empire is catapults landed upon his leg crushing it beyond repair
we had to amputate
the men who were beside him said that when the missile struck he immediately began screaming about the light and when they picked him up they noticed that his eyes had turned pure white
even his pupils have disappeared
ah
you have been most helpful
thank you
that we live in a strange world and i will be lucky if i ever understand more than a small portion of ** then he recounted his conversation with the man which she found as interesting as he had
you should tell arya about this said nasuada
