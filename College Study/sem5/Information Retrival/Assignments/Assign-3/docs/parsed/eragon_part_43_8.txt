besides if i had stayed in teirm solembum would have left without me and i enjoy his company
but tell me what adventures have befallen you since last we talked
for the next hour eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months
angela listened quietly but when he mentioned murtagh is name she sputtered **
eragon nodded
he told me who he is
but let me finish my story before you make any ** he continued with his tale
when it was complete angela leaned back in her chair thoughtfully her reeds forgotten
without warning solembum jumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap
he curled up eyeing eragon haughtily
angela petted the werecat
fascinating
galbatorix allied with the urgals and murtagh finally out in the open
i d warn you to be careful with murtagh but you re obviously aware of the danger
murtagh has been a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally said eragon firmly
all the same be ** angela paused then said distastefully and then there is the matter of this shade durza
i think he is the greatest threat to the varden right now aside from galbatorix
iloathe shades they practice the most unholy magic after necromancy
i d like to dig his heart out with a dull hairpin and feed it to a **
eragon was startled by her sudden vehemence
i do not understand
brom told me that shades were sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will but why does that make them so evil
angela shook her head
it does not
ordinary sorcerers are just that ordinary neither better nor worse than the rest of us
they use their magical strength to control spirits and the spirits powers
shades however relinquish that control in their search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlledby spirits
unfortunately only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans and once ensconced they never leave
such possession can happen by accident if a sorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself
the problem is once a shade is created it is terribly difficult to kill
as i am sure you know only two people laetri the elf and irnstad the rider ever survived that feat
i ve heard the ** eragon gestured at the room
why are you living so high up in tronjheim is not it inconvenient being this isolated and how did you get all this stuff up here
angela threw back her head and laughed wryly
truthfully i am in hiding
when i first came to tronjheim i had a few days of peace until one of guards who let me into farthen dur blabbed about who i was
then all the magic users here though theybarely rate the term pestered me to join their secret group
especially those drajl twins who control it
finally i threatened to turn the lot of them into toads excuse me frogs but when that did not deter them i sneaked up here in the middle of the night
it was less work than you might imagine especially for one with my skills
did you have to let the twins into your mind before you were allowed into farthen dur asked eragon
i was forced to let them sift through my memories
a cold gleam leapt into angela is eye
the twins would not dare probe me for fear of what i might do to them
oh they d love to but they know the effort would leave them broken and gibbering nonsense
i ve been coming here long before the varden began examining people is minds
and they re not about to start on me now
she peered into the other room and said ** this has been an enlightening talk but i am afraid you have to go now
my brew of mandrake root and newt is tongue is about to boil and it needs attending
do come back again when you have the time
andplease do not tell anyone that i am here
i d hate to have to move again
it would make me very
irritated
and you do not want to see me **
i will keep your secret assured eragon getting up
solembum jumped off angela is lap as she stood
** she exclaimed
eragon said farewell and left the room
solembum guided him back to the dragonhold then dismissed him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away
adwarf was waiting for eragon in the dragonhold
after bowing and muttering argetlam the dwarf said with a thick accent good
