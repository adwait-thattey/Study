then as darkness gathered around the radius of his torch roran drew himself upright and resumed speaking
he hid nothing only labored to make them understand his thoughts and feelings so they too could share the sense of purpose that drove him
our age is at an end
we must step forward and cast our lot with the varden if we and our children are to live ** he spoke with rage and honeyed tones in equal amount but always with a fervid conviction that kept his audience entranced
when his store of images was exhausted roran looked into the faces of his friends and neighbors and said i march in two days
accompany me if you wish but i go ** he bowed his head and stepped out of the light
overhead the waning moon glowed behind a lens of clouds
a slight breeze wafted through carvahall
an iron weather vane creaked on a roof as it swung in the direction of the current
from within the crowd birgit picked her way into the light clutching the folds of her dress to avoid tripping
with a subdued expression she adjusted her shawl
today we saw an
she stopped shook her head and laughed in an embarrassed way
i find it hard to speak after roran
i do not like his plan but i believe that it is necessary although for a different reason i would hunt down the ra zac and avenge my husband is death
i will go with him
and i will take my ** she too stepped away from the torch
a silent minute passed then delwin and his wife lenna advanced with their arms around each other
lenna looked at birgit and said i understand your need sister
we want our vengeance as well but more than that we want the rest of our children to be safe
for that reason we too will ** several women whose husbands had been slain came forward and agreed with her
the villagers murmured among themselves then fell silent and motionless
no one else seemed willing to address the subject it was too momentous
roran understood
he was still trying to digest the implications himself
finally horst strode to the torch and stared with a drawn face into the flame
it is no good talking any more
we need time to think
every man must decide for himself
tomorrow
tomorrow will be another day
perhaps things will be clearer ** he shook his head and lifted the torch then inverted it and extinguished it against the ground leaving everyone to find their way home in the moonlight
roran joined albriech and baldor who walked behind their parents at a discreet distance giving them privacy to talk
neither of the brothers would look at roran
unsettled by their lack of expression roran asked do you think anyone else will go was i good enough
albriech emitted a bark of laughter
good **
roran said baldor in an odd voice you could have convinced an urgal to become a farmer tonight
when you finished i was ready to grab my spear and dash into the spine after you
i would not have been alone either
the question is not whowill leave it is whowo not
what you said
i ve never heard anything like it before
roran frowned
his goal had been to persuade people to accept his plan not to get them to follow him ** that is what it takes he thought with a shrug
still the prospect had caught him unawares
at an earlier time it would have disturbed him but now he was just thankful for anything that could help him to rescue katrina and save the villagers
baldor leaned toward his brother
father would lose most of his ** albriech nodded solemnly
roran knew that smiths made whatever implement was required by the task at hand and that these custom tools formed a legacy that was bequeathed from father to son or from master to journeyman
one measure of a smith is wealth and skill was the number of tools he owned
for horst to surrender his would be
would be no harder than what anyone else has to do thought roran
he only regretted that it would entail depriving albriech and baldor of their rightful inheritance
when they reached the house roran retreated to baldor is room and lay in bed
through the walls he could still hear the faint sound of horst and elain talking
he fell asleep imagining similar discussions taking place throughout carvahall deciding his and their fate
