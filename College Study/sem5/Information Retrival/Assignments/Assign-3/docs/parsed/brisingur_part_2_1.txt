later the stone cracks open and a baby dragon emerges
when eragon touches her a silvery mark appears on his palm and an irrevocable bond is forged between their minds making eragon one of the legendary dragon riders
he names the dragon saphira after a dragon mentioned by the village storyteller brom
the dragon riders were created thousands of years earlier in the aftermath of the devastating war between the elves and the dragons in order to prevent their two races from ever again fighting each other
the riders became peacekeepers educators healers natural philosophers and the greatest of all magicians since being joined with a dragon makes one a spellcaster
under their guidance and protection the land enjoyed a golden age
when humans arrived in alagaesia they too were added to this elite order
after many years of peace the warlike urgals killed the dragon of a young human rider named galbatorix
the loss drove him mad and when his elders refused to provide him with another dragon galbatorix set out to topple the riders
he stole another dragon whom he named shruikan and forced to serve him through certain black spells and gathered around himself a group of thirteen traitors the forsworn
with the help of those cruel disciples galbatorix threw down the riders killed their leader vrael and declared himself king over alagaesia
his actions forced the elves to retreat deep within their pinewood forest and the dwarves to hide in their tunnels and caves and neither race now ventures forth from its secret places
the stalemate between galbatorix and the other races has endured for over a hundred years during which all of the forsworn have died from various causes
it is into this tense political situation that eragon finds himself thrust
several months after saphira hatches two menacing beetle like strangers called the ra zac arrive in carvahall searching for the stone that was saphira is egg
eragon and saphira manage to evade them but they destroy eragon is home and murder garrow
eragon vows to track down and kill the ra zac
as he leaves carvahall the storyteller brom who knows of saphira is existence accosts eragon and asks to accompany him
brom gives eragon a red dragon rider is sword zar roc though he refuses to say how he acquired it
eragon learns much from brom during their travels including how to fight with swords and use magic
when they lose the ra zac is trail they go to the port town of teirm and visit brom is old friend jeod who brom thinks may be able to help them locate the ra zac is lair
in teirm they learn that the ra zac live somewhere close to the city of dras leona
eragon also has his fortune told by the herbalist angela and receives two strange pieces of advice from her companion the werecat solembum
on the way to dras leona brom reveals that he is an agent of the varden a rebel group dedicated to overthrowing galbatorix and that he had been hiding in carvahall waiting for a new dragon rider to appear
twenty years ago brom was involved in stealing saphira is egg from galbatorix and in the process killed morzan first and last of the forsworn
only two other dragon eggs still exist both of which remain in galbatorix is possession
in and near dras leona they encounter the ra zac who mortally wound brom while he is protecting eragon
a mysterious young man named murtagh drives the ra zac away
with his dying breath brom confesses that he too was once a rider and that his slain dragon was also named saphira
eragon and saphira then decide to join the varden but eragon is captured at the city of gil ead and brought before durza an evil and powerful shade who serves galbatorix
with murtagh is help eragon escapes from prison bringing along with him the elf arya another captive of durza is and an ambassador to the varden
arya has been poisoned and requires the varden is medical help
pursued by a contingent of urgals the four of them flee across the land to the varden is headquarters in the giant beor mountains which stand over ten miles high
circumstances force murtagh who does not want to go to the varden to reveal that he is the son of morzan
