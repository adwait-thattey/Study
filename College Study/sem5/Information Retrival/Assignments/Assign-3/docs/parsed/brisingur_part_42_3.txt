the god if god he was wore nothing but a knotted loincloth
his face was dark and heavy and seemed to contain equal amounts of cruelty and kindness as if he might veer between the extremes of both without warning
as he noticed those details eragon also became aware of the presence of a strange far reaching consciousness within the chamber a consciousness of unreadable thoughts and unfathomable depths a consciousness that flashed and growled and billowed in unexpected directions like a summer thunderstorm
eragon quickly sequestered his mind from the touch of the other
his skin prickled and a cold shiver ran down him
he did not know what he had felt but fear gripped him and he looked at saphira for comfort
she was staring at the figure her blue cat eyes sparkling with unusual intensity
with a single motion the dwarves sank to their knees
the god spoke then and his voice sounded like the grinding of boulders and the sweep of the wind over barren mountain peaks and the slap of waves against a stony shore
he spoke in dwarvish and though eragon knew not what was said he shrank from the power of the god is speech
three times the god questioned orik and three times orik replied his own voice faint in comparison
apparently pleased with orik is answers the apparition extended his glowing arms and placed his forefingers on either side of orik is bare head
the air between the god is fingers rippled and upon orik is brow materialized the gem encrusted helm of gold that hrothgar had worn
the god slapped his belly and uttered a booming chuckle and then faded into oblivion
the rose petals resumed their fall uninterrupted
un qroth ** gannel proclaimed
loud and brassy the trumpets blared
rising from his knee orik ascended the dais turned to face the assembly and then he sank into the hard black throne
nal grimstnzborith ** the dwarves shouted and struck their shields with their axes and their spears and stamped the floor with their feet
nal grimstnzborith ** nal grimstnzborith **
all hail king ** cried eragon
arching her neck saphira roared her tribute and released a jet of flame over the heads of the dwarves incinerating a swath of rose petals
eragon is eyes watered as a blast of heat washed over him
then gannel knelt before orik and spoke some more in dwarvish
when he finished orik touched him upon the crown of his head and then gannel returned to his place at the edge of the chamber
nado approached the throne and said many of the same things and after him so did manndrath and hadfala and all the other clan chiefs with the sole exception of grimstborith vermund who had been banned from the coronation
they must be pledging themselves to orik is service eragon said to saphira
did not they already give him their word
aye but not in public
eragon watched thordris walk toward the throne before saying saphira what do you think we just saw could that really have been guntera or was it an illusion his mind seemed real enough and i do not know how one might fake that but
it may have been an illusion she said
the dwarves gods have never helped them upon the field of battle nor in any other endeavor i am aware of
nor do i believe that a true god would come running at gannel is summons like a trained hound
i would not and should not a god be greater than a dragon
but then there are many inexplicable things in alagaesia
it is possible we have seen a shade from a long forgotten age a pale remnant of what once was that continues to haunt the land longing for the return of its power
who can know for sure
once the final clan chief had presented himself to orik the guild leaders did the same and then orik gestured toward eragon
with a slow measured pace eragon walked forward between the rows of dwarf warriors until he reached the base of the throne where he knelt and as a member of durgrimst ingeitum acknowledged orik as his king and swore to serve and protect him
then acting as nasuada is emissary eragon congratulated orik on behalf of nasuada and the varden and promised him the varden is friendship
