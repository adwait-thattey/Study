roran pointed toward the house he was leaning against and said take your bows and climb onto the roof as many of you as will fit but if you value your lives stay out of sight until i say otherwise
when i tell you to start shooting and keep shooting until you run out of arrows or until every last soldier is dead
understood
get going then
the rest of you find buildings of your own where you can pick off the soldiers
harald spread the word to everyone else and find ten of our best spearmen and ten of our best swordsmen and bring them here as fast as you can
with a flurry of motion the warriors hurried to obey
those who were closest to roran retrieved their bows and quivers from behind their saddles and then standing upon the backs of their horses pulled themselves onto the thatched roof of the house
four minutes later the majority of roran is men were in place on the roofs of seven different houses with about eight men per roof and harald had returned with the requested swordsmen and spearmen in tow
to the warriors gathered around him roran said right now listen
when i give the order the men up there will start shooting
as soon as the first flight of arrows strikes the soldiers we re going to ride out and attempt to rescue captain edric
if we can not we will have to settle for giving the red tunics a taste of good cold steel
the archers should provide enough confusion for us to close with the soldiers before they can use their crossbows
am i understood
with full throated yells the men stationed on the houses rose up above the ridges of the roofs and as one fired their bows at the soldiers below
the swarm of arrows whistled through the air like bloodthirsty shrikes diving toward their prey
an instant later when soldiers began to howl with agony at their wounds roran said now ** and jabbed his heels into snowfire
together he and his men galloped around the side of the house pulling their steeds into such a tight turn that they nearly fell over
relying on his speed and the skill of the archers for protection roran skirted the soldiers who were flailing in disarray until he came upon the site of edric is disastrous charge
there the ground was slick with blood and the corpses of many good men and fine horses littered the space between the houses
edric is remaining forces were engaged in hand to hand combat with the soldiers
to roran is surprise edric was still alive fighting back to back with five of his men
stay with ** roran shouted to his companions as they raced into the battle
lashing out with his hooves snowfire knocked two soldiers to the ground breaking their sword arms and staving in their rib cages
pleased with the stallion roran laid about himself with his hammer snarling with the fierce joy of battle as he felled soldier after soldier none of whom could withstand the ferocity of his assault
to ** he shouted as he drew abreast of edric and the other survivors
to ** in front of him arrows continued to rain down upon the mass of soldiers forcing them to cover themselves with their shields while at the same time trying to fend off the varden is swords and spears
once he and his warriors had surrounded the varden who were on foot roran shouted ** ** to the ** step by step the lot of them withdrew until they were out of reach of the soldiers blades and then they turned and ran toward the nearest house
the soldiers shot and killed three of the varden along the way but the rest arrived at the building unharmed
edric slumped against the side of the house gasping for breath
when again he was able to speak he gestured at roran is men and said your intervention is most timely and welcome stronghammer but why do i see you here and not riding out from among the soldiers as i expected
then roran explained what he had done and pointed out the archers on the roofs
a dark scowl appeared on edric is brow as he listened to roran is account
however he did not chastise roran for his disobedience but merely said have those men come down at once
they have succeeded in breaking the soldiers discipline
