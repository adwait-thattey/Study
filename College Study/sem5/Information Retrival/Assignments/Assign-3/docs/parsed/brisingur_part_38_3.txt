desperate to save the woman and the boy roran urged snowfire to the limit of his speed
looking back he was heartened to see that his contingent of men had separated from the rest of the varden without too much trouble aside from a few stragglers the majority were in a single bunch not thirty feet behind him
roran glimpsed carn riding at the vanguard of edric is men his gray cloak flapping in the wind
once again roran wished edric had allowed them to remain in the same group
as were his orders roran did not enter the village head on but rather veered to the left and rode around the buildings so as to flank the soldiers and attack them from another direction
sand did the same on the right while edric and his warriors drove straight into the village
a line of houses concealed the initial clash from roran but he heard a chorus of frantic shouts then a series of strange metallic twangs and then the screams of men and horses
worry knotted roran is gut
what was that noise could it be metal bows do they exist regardless of the cause he knew there should not have been so many horses crying out in agony
roran is limbs went cold as he realized with utter certainty that the attack had somehow gone wrong and that the battle might already be lost
he pulled hard on snowfire is reins as they passed the last house steering him toward the center of the village
behind him his men did the same
two hundred yards ahead roran saw a triple line of soldiers positioned between two houses so as to block their way
the soldiers seemed unafraid of the horses racing toward them
roran hesitated
his orders were clear he and his men were to charge the western flank and cut their way through galbatorix is troops until they rejoined sand and edric
however edric had not told roran what he should do if riding straight up to the soldiers no longer seemed a good idea once he and his men were in position
and roran knew that if he deviated from his orders even if it was to prevent his men from being massacred he would be guilty of insubordination and edric could punish him accordingly
then the soldiers swept aside their voluminous cloaks and raised drawn crossbows to their shoulders
in that instant roran decided that he would do whatever was necessary in order to ensure the varden won the battle
he was not about to let the soldiers destroy his force with a single volley of arrows just because he wished to avoid the unpleasant consequences of defying his captain
take ** shouted roran and wrenched snowfire is head to the right forcing the animal to swerve behind a house
a dozen quarrels buried themselves in the side of the building a second later
turning around roran saw that all but one of his warriors had managed to duck behind nearby houses before the soldiers fired
the man who had been too slow lay bleeding in the dirt a pair of quarrels projecting from his chest
the bolts had torn through his mail hauberk as if it were no thicker than a sheet of tissue
frightened by the smell of blood his horse kicked up its heels and fled the village leaving a plume of dust rising in its wake
roran reached over and grasped the edge of a beam in the side of the house holding snowfire in place while he desperately tried to figure out how to proceed
the soldiers had him and his men pinned down they could not step back out into the open without being shot so full of quarrels they would resemble hedgehogs
a group of roran is warriors rode up to him from a house that his own building partially shielded from the soldiers line of sight
what should we do stronghammer they asked him
they did not seem bothered by the fact that he had disobeyed his orders to the contrary they looked at him with expressions of newfound trust
thinking as fast as he could roran cast his gaze around
by chance his eyes alighted upon the bow and quiver strapped behind one of the men is saddles
roran smiled
only a few of the warriors fought as archers but they all carried a bow and arrows so they could hunt for food and help feed the company when they were alone in the wilderness without support from the rest of the varden
