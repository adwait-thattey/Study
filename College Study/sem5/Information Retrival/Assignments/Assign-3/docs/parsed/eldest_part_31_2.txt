north of teirm the only port he knew of was narda but to reach it he would have to cross the entire width of the spine a feat unheard of even for the trappers
roran swore quietly
the conjecture was ** should be trying to save carvahall not desert it
the problem was he had already determined that the village and all who remained in it were doomed
tears gathered at the corners of his eyes ** who remain
what
what if everyone in carvahall accompanied me to narda and then to surda he would achieve both his desires simultaneously
the audacity of the idea stunned him
it was heresy blasphemy to think that he could convince the farmers to abandon their fields and the merchants their shops
and yet
and yet what was the alternative but slavery or death the varden were the only group that would harbor fugitives of the empire and roran was sure that the rebels would be delighted to have a village is worth of recruits especially ones who had proved themselves in battle
also by bringing the villagers to them he would earn the varden is confidence so that they would trust him with the location of the ra ** they can explain why galbatorix is so desperate to capture me
if the plan were to succeed though it would have to be implemented before the new troops reached carvahall which left only a few days if that to arrange the departure of some three hundred people
the logistics were frightening to consider
roran knew that mere reason could not persuade anyone to leave it would require messianic zeal to stir people is emotions to make themfeel in the depths of their hearts the need to relinquish the trappings of their identities and lives
nor would it be enough to simply instill fear for he knew that fear often made those in peril fight harder
rather he had to instill a sense of purpose and destiny to make the villagers believe as he did that joining the varden and resisting galbatorix is tyranny was the noblest action in the world
it required passion that could not be intimidated by hardship deterred by suffering or quenched by death
in his mind roran saw katrina standing before him pale and ghostly with solemn amber eyes
he remembered the heat of her skin the mulled scent of her hair and what it felt like to be with her under the cover of darkness
then in a long line behind her appeared his family friends and everyone he had known in carvahall both dead and ** not for eragon
and me
the ra zac would have never come here
i must rescue the village from the empire as surely as i must rescue katrina from those desecrators
drawing upon the strength of his vision roran rose from bed causing his maimed shoulder to burn and sting
he staggered and leaned against a ** i ever regain the use of my right arm he waited for the pain to subside
when it did not he bared his teeth shoved himself upright and marched from the room
elain was folding towels in the hallway
she cried out with amazement
** what are you
with a worried expression baldor stepped out of a doorway
roran you should not be walking around
you lost too much blood
i will help
roran heard them follow as he descended the curved stairs toward the entrance of the house where horst and albriech stood talking
they looked up with astonishment
he ignored the babble of questions opened the front door and stepped into the evening is faded light
above an imposing plume of clouds was laced with gold and purple
leading the small group roran stomped to the edge of carvahall repeating his monosyllabic message whenever he passed a man or woman pulled a torch mounted on a pole from the grasping mud wheeled about and retraced his path to the center of town
there he stabbed the pole between his feet then raised his left arm and roared **
the village rang with his voice
he continued the summons as people drifted from the houses and shadowed alleyways and began to gather around him
many were curious others sympathetic some awed and some angry
again and again roran is chant echoed in the valley
loring arrived with his sons in tow
from the opposite direction came birgit delwin and fisk with his wife isold
