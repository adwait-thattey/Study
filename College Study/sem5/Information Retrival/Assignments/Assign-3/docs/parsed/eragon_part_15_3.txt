they were chalky white and oozed clear liquid
a cloying sickening smell hung over him the odor of rotting fruit
his breath came in short jerks each one sounding like a death rattle
do not say that
he can still be ** we have to get him to gertrude
i can not carry him to carvahall though
saphira presented an image of garrow hanging under her while she flew
can you lift both of us
eragon dug through the rubble until he found a board and leather thongs
he had saphira pierce a hole with a claw at each of the board is corners then he looped a piece of leather through each hole and tied them to her forelegs
after checking to make sure the knots were secure he rolled garrow onto the board and lashed him down
as he did a scrap of black cloth fell from his uncle is hand
it matched the strangers clothing
he angrily stuffed it in a pocket mounted saphira and closed his eyes as his body settled into a steady throb of **
she leapt up hind legs digging into the ground
her wings clawed at the air as she slowly climbed
tendons strained and popped as she battled gravity
for a long painful second nothing happened but then she lunged forward powerfully and they rose higher
once they were over the forest eragon told her follow the road
it will give you enough room if you have to land
it does not matter ** argued no further as she veered to the road and headed for carvahall
garrow swung wildly underneath them only the slender leather cords kept him from falling
the extra weight slowed saphira
before long her head sagged and there was froth at her mouth
she struggled to continue yet they were almost a league from carvahall when she locked her wings and sank toward the road
her hind feet touched with a shower of snow
eragon tumbled off her landing heavily on his side to avoid hurting his legs
he struggled to his feet and worked to untie the leather from saphira is legs
her thick panting filled the ** a safe place to rest he ** do not know how long i will be gone so you re going to have to take care of yourself for a while
he gritted his teeth and began to drag garrow down the road
the first few steps sent an explosion of agony through him
i can not do ** he howled at the sky then took a few more steps
his mouth locked into a snarl
he stared at the ground between his feet as he forced himself to hold a steady pace
it was a fight against his unruly body a fight he refused to lose
the minutes crawled by at an excruciating rate
each yard he covered seemed many times that
with desperation he wondered if carvahall still existed or if the strangers had burnt it down too
after a time through a haze of pain he heard shouting and looked up
brom was running toward him eyes large hair awry and one side of his head caked with dried blood
he waved his arms wildly before dropping his staff and grabbing eragon is shoulders saying something in a loud voice
eragon blinked uncomprehendingly
without warning the ground rushed up to meet him
he tasted blood then blacked out
