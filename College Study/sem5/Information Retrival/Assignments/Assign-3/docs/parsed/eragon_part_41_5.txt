he continued in a clipped tone my father was if nothing else a cunning man
he knew that the pregnancy put both him and my mother in danger not to mention the baby that is me
so in the dead of night he spirited her away from the palace and took her to his castle
once there he laid down powerful spells that prevented anyone from entering his estate except for a few chosen servants
in this way the pregnancy was kept secret from everyone but galbatorix
galbatorix knew the intimate details of the thirteen is lives their plots their fights and most importantly their thoughts
he enjoyed watching them battle each other and often helped one or the other for his own amusement
but for some reason he never revealed my existence
i was born in due time and given to a wet nurse so my mother could return to morzan is side
she had no choice in the matter
morzan allowed her to visit me every few months but otherwise we were kept apart
another three years passed like this during which time he gave me the
scar on my ** murtagh brooded a minute before continuing
i would have grown to manhood in this fashion if morzan had not been summoned away to hunt for saphira is egg
as soon as he departed my mother who had been left behind vanished
no one knows where she went or why
the king tried to hunt her down but his men could not find her trail no doubt because of morzan is training
at the time of my birth only five of the thirteen were still alive
by the time morzan left that number had been reduced to three when he finally faced brom in gil ead he was the only one remaining
the forsworn died through various means suicide ambush overuse of magic
but it was mostly the work of the varden
i am told that the king was in a terrible rage because of those losses
however before word of morzan is and the others deaths reached us my mother returned
many months had passed since she had disappeared
her health was poor as if she had suffered a great illness and she grew steadily worse
within a fortnight she died
murtagh shrugged
i grew up
the king brought me to the palace and arranged for my upbringing
aside from that he left me alone
a hard laugh broke from murtagh
escaped is more like it
at my last birthday when i turned eighteen the king summoned me to his quarters for a private dinner
the message surprised me because i had always distanced myself from the court and had rarely met him
we d talked before but always within earshot of eavesdropping nobles
i accepted the offer of course aware that it would be unwise to refuse
the meal was sumptuous but throughout it his black eyes never left me
his gaze was disconcerting it seemed that he was searching for something hidden in my face
i did not know what to make of it and did my best to provide polite conversation but he refused to talk and i soon ceased my efforts
when the meal was finished he finally began to speak
you ve never heard his voice so it is hard for me to make you understand what it was like
his words were entrancing like a snake whispering gilded lies into my ears
a more convincing and frightening man i ve never heard
he wove a vision a fantasy of the empire as he imagined it
there would be beautiful cities built across the country filled with the greatest warriors artisans musicians and philosophers
the urgals would finally be eradicated
and the empire would expand in every direction until it reached the four corners of alagaesia
peace and prosperity would flourish but more wondrous yet the riders would be brought back to gently govern over galbatorix is fiefdoms
entranced i listened to him for what must have been hours
when he stopped i eagerly asked how the riders would be reinstated for everyone knew there were no dragon eggs left
galbatorix grew still then and stared at me thoughtfully
for a long time he was silent but then he extended his hand and asked will you o son of my friend serve me as i labor to bring about this paradise
though i knew the history behind his and my father is rise to power the dream he had painted for me was too compelling too seductive to ignore
