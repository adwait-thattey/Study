eragon entered an elegant two story study paneled with rows of cedar bookshelves
a wrought iron staircase wound up to a small balcony with two chairs and a reading table
white lanterns hung along the walls and ceiling so a book could be read anywhere in the room
the stone floor was covered by an intricate oval rug
at the far end of the room a man stood behind a large walnut desk
his skin gleamed the color of oiled ebony
the dome of his head was shaved bare but a closely trimmed black beard covered his chin and upper lip
strong features shadowed his face and grave intelligent eyes lurked under his brow
his shoulders were broad and powerful emphasized by a tapered red vest embroidered with gold thread and clasped over a rich purple shirt
he bore himself with great dignity exuding an intense commanding air
when he spoke his voice was strong confident welcome to tronjheim eragon and saphira
i am ajihad
please seat yourselves
eragon slipped into an armchair next to murtagh while saphira settled protectively behind them
ajihad raised his hand and snapped his fingers
a man stepped out from behind the staircase
he was identical to the bald man beside him
eragon stared at the two of them with surprise and murtagh stiffened
your confusion is understandable they are twin brothers said ajihad with a small smile
i would tell you their names but they have none
saphira hissed with distaste
ajihad watched her for a moment then sat in a high backed chair behind the desk
the twins retreated under the stairs and stood impassively beside each other
ajihad pressed his fingers together as he stared at eragon and murtagh
he studied them for a long time with an unwavering gaze
eragon squirmed uncomfortable
after what seemed like several minutes ajihad lowered his hands and beckoned to the twins
one of them hurried to his side
ajihad whispered in his ear
the bald man suddenly paled and shook his head vigorously
ajihad frowned then nodded as if something had been confirmed
he looked at murtagh
you have placed me in a difficult position by refusing to be examined
you have been allowed into farthen dur because the twins have assured me that they can control you and because of your actions on behalf of eragon and arya
i understand that there may be things you wish to keep hidden in your mind but as long as you do we cannot trust you
you would not trust me anyway said murtagh defiantly
ajihad is face darkened as murtagh spoke and his eyes flashed dangerously
though it is been twenty and three years since it last broke upon my ear
i know that ** he stood ominously chest swelling
the twins looked alarmed and put their heads together whispering frantically
it came from another man one more beast than human
get up
murtagh warily complied his eyes darting between the twins and ajihad
remove your shirt ordered ajihad
with a shrug murtagh pulled off his tunic
now turn ** as he pivoted to the side light fell upon the scar on his back
murtagh breathed ajihad
a grunt of surprise came from orik
without warning ajihad turned on the twins and thundered did you know of this
the twins bowed their heads
we discovered his name in eragon is mind but we did not suspect that thisboy was the son of one as powerful as morzan
it never occurred
and you did not tell me demanded ajihad
he raised a hand forestalling their explanation
we will discuss it ** he faced murtagh again
first i must untangle this muddle
do you still refuse to be probed
yes said murtagh sharply slipping back into his tunic
i wo not let anyone inside my head
ajihad leaned on his desk
there will be unpleasant consequences if you do not
unless the twins can certify that you are not a threat we cannot give you credence despite and perhaps because of the assistance you have given eragon
without that verification the people here dwarf and human alike will tear you apart if they learn of your presence
i will be forced to keep you confined at all times as much for your protection as for ours
it will only get worse once the dwarf king hrothgar demands custody of you
do not force yourself into that situation when it can easily be avoided
