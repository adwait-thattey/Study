the days leading up to the agaeti blodhren were the best and worst of times for eragon
his back troubled him more than ever battering down his health and endurance and destroying his calm of mind he lived in constant fear of triggering an episode
yet in contrast he and saphira had never been so close
they lived as much in each other is minds as in their own
and every now and then arya would visit the tree house and walk through ellesmera with eragon and saphira
she never came alone though always bringing either orik or maud the werecat
over the course of their wanderings arya introduced eragon and saphira to elves of distinction great warriors poets and artists
she took them to concerts held under the thatched pines
and she showed them many hidden wonders of ellesmera
eragon seized every opportunity to talk with her
he told her about his upbringing in palancar valley about roran garrow and his aunt marian stories of sloan ethlbert and the other villagers and his love of the mountains surrounding carvahall and the flaming sheets of light that adorned the winter sky at night
he told her about the time a vixen fell into gedric is tanning vats and had to be fished out with a net
he told her about the joy he found in planting a crop weeding and nurturing it and watching the tender green shoots grow under his care a joy that he knew she of all people could appreciate
in turn eragon gleaned occasional insights into her own life
he heard mentions of her childhood her friends and family and her experiences among the varden which she spoke about most freely describing raids and battles she participated in treaties she helped to negotiate her disputes with the dwarves and the momentous events she witnessed during her tenure as ambassador
between her and saphira a measure of peace entered eragon is heart but it was a precarious balance that the slightest influence might disrupt
time itself was an enemy for arya was destined to leave du weldenvarden after the agaeti blodhren
thus eragon treasured his moments with her and dreaded the arrival of the forthcoming celebration
the entire city bustled with activity as the elves prepared for the agaeti blodhren
eragon had never seen them so excited before
they decorated the forest with colored bunting and lanterns especially around the menoa tree while the tree itself was adorned with a lantern upon the tip of each branch where they hung like glowing teardrops
even the plants eragon noticed took on a festive appearance with a collection of bright new flowers
he often heard the elves singing to them late at night
each day hundreds of elves arrived in ellesmera from their cities scattered throughout the woods for no elf would willingly miss the centennial observance of their treaty with the dragons
eragon guessed that many of them also came to meet ** seems as if i do nothing but repeat their greeting he thought
the elves who were absent because of their responsibilities would hold their own festivities simultaneously and would participate in the ceremonies at ellesmera by scrying through enchanted mirrors that displayed the likeness of those watching so that no one felt as if they were being spied upon
a week before the agaeti blodhren when eragon and saphira were about to return to their quarters from the crags of tel naeir oromis said you should both think about what you can bring to the blood oath celebration
unless your creations require magic to make or to function i suggest that you avoid using gramarye
no one will respect your work if it is the product of a spell and not of your own hands
i also suggest you each make a separate piece
that too is custom
in the air eragon asked saphira do you have any ideas
i might have one
but if you do not mind i d like to see if it works before i tell ** caught part of an image from her of a bare knuckle of stone protruding from the forest floor before she concealed it from him
he ** not you give me a hint
back in their tree house eragon cataloged his skills and thought i know more about farming than anything else but i do not see how i can turn that to my advantage
