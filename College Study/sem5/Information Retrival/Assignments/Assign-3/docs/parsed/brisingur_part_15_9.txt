he shivered
if there is one thing i ve learned since becoming a rider it is that you never ever want to have a dragon for an enemy
what about their true names he asked
did they erase those as well
arya nodded
true names birth names nicknames family names titles
everything
and as a result the thirteen were reduced to little more than animals
no longer could they say i like this or i dislike that or i have green scales for to say that would be to name themselves
they could not even call themselves dragons
word by word the spell obliterated everything that defined them as thinking creatures and the forsworn had no choice but to watch in silent misery as their dragons descended into complete ignorance
the experience was so disturbing at least five of the thirteen and several of the forsworn went mad as a ** arya paused considering the outline of a glyph then rubbed it out and redrew it
the banishing of the names is the main reason so many people now believe that dragons were nothing more than animals to ride from one place to another
they would not believe that if they had met saphira said eragon
arya smiled
** with a flourish she completed the latest sentence she had been working on
he tilted his head and sidled closer in order to decipher the glyphs she had inscribed
they read the trickster the riddler the keeper of the balance he of the many faces who finds life in death and who fears no evil he who walks through doors
what prompted you to write this
the thought that many things are not what they ** dust billowed around her hand as she patted the ground effacing the glyphs from the surface of the earth
has anyone tried to guess galbatorix is true name eragon asked
it seems as if that would be the fastest way to end this war
to be honest i think it might be the only hope we have of vanquishing him in battle
were you not being honest with me before asked arya a gleam in her eyes
her question forced him to chuckle
of course not
it is just a figure of speech
and a poor one at that she said
unless you happen to be in the habit of lying
eragon floundered for a moment before he caught hold of his thread of speech again and could say i know it would be hard to find galbatorix is true name but if all the elves and all the members of the varden who know the ancient language searched for it we could not help but succeed
like a pale sun bleached pennant the dry blade of grass hung from between arya is left thumb and forefinger
it trembled in sympathy with each surge of blood through her veins
pinching it at the top with her other hand she tore the leaf in half lengthwise then did the same with each of the resulting strips quartering the leaf
then she began to plait the strips forming a stiff braided rod
she said galbatorix is true name is no great secret
three different elves one a rider and two ordinary spellcasters discovered it on their own and many years apart
unperturbed arya picked another blade of grass tore it into strips inserted the pieces into the gaps in her braided rod and continued plaiting in a different direction
we can only speculate whether galbatorix himself knows his true name
i am of the opinion that he does not for whatever it is his true name must be so terrible he could not go on living if he heard it
unless he is so evil or so demented the truth about his actions has no power to disturb him
** her nimble fingers flew so fast twisting braiding weaving that they were nearly invisible
she picked two more blades of grass
either way galbatorix is certainly aware that he has a true name like all creatures and things and that it is a potential weakness
at some point before he embarked upon his campaign against the riders he cast a spell that kills whoever uses his true name
and since we do not know exactly how this spell kills we cannot shield ourselves from it
you see then why we have all but abandoned that line of inquiry
oromis is one of the few who are brave enough to continue seeking out galbatorix is name albeit in a roundabout ** with a pleased expression she held out her hands palms upward
