why did not brom tell me about this if it is so important why did not he train me in it himself
brom told you said oromis what was appropriate to tell you under the circumstances
dipping into the pool of minds can prove addictive to those with a malicious personality or a taste for power
it was not taught to prospective riders though we had them meditate as you do throughout their training until we were convinced that they were mature enough to resist temptation
itis an invasion of privacy and you will learn many things from it that you never wanted to
however this is for your own good and the good of the varden
i can say from experience and from watching other riders experience the same that this above all else will help you to understand what drives people
and understanding begets empathy and compassion even for the meanest beggar in the meanest city of alagaesia
they were quiet for a while eating then oromis asked can you tell me what is the most important mental tool a person can possess
it was a serious question and eragon considered it for a reasonable span before he ventured to say determination
oromis tore the loaf in half with his long white fingers
i can understand why you arrived at that conclusion determination has served you well in your adventures but no
i meant the tool most necessary to choose the best course of action in any given situation
determination is as common among men who are dull and foolish as it is among those who are brilliant intellects
so no determination cannot be what we re looking for
this time eragon treated the question as he would a riddle counting the number of words whispering them out loud to establish whether they rhymed and otherwise examining them for hidden meaning
the problem was he was no more than a mediocre riddler and had never placed very high in carvahall is annual riddle contest
he thought too literally to work out the answers to riddles that he had not heard before a legacy of garrow is practical upbringing
wisdom he finally said
wisdom is the most important tool for a person to possess
a fair guess but again no
the answer is logic
or to put it another way the ability to reason analytically
applied properly it can overcome any lack of wisdom which one only gains through age and experience
eragon frowned
yes but is not having a good heart more important than logic pure logic can lead you to conclusions that are ethically wrong whereas if you are moral and righteous that will ensure that you do not act shamefully
a razor thin smile curled oromis is lips
you confuse the issue
all i wanted to know was the most usefultool a person can have regardless of whether that person is good or evil
i agree that it is important to be of a virtuous nature but i would also contend that if you had to choose between giving a man a noble disposition or teaching him to think clearly you d do better to teach him to think clearly
too many problems in this world are caused by men with noble dispositions and clouded minds
history provides us with numerous examples of people who were convinced that they were doing the right thing and committed terrible crimes because of it
keep in mind eragon that no one thinks of himself as a villain and few make decisions they think are wrong
a person may dislike his choice but he will stand by it because even in the worst circumstances he believes that it was the best option available to him at the time
on its own being a decent person is no guarantee that you will act well which brings us back to the one protection we have against demagogues tricksters and the madness of crowds and our surest guide through the uncertain shoals of life clear and reasoned thinking
logic will never fail you unless you re unaware of or deliberately ignore the consequences of your deeds
if elves are so logical said eragon then you must all agree on what to do
hardly averred oromis
like every race we adhere to a wide range of tenets and as a result we often arrive at differing conclusions even in identical situations
conclusions i might add that make logical sense from each person is point of view
