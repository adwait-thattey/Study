we have been observing the city of ceunon for we intend to attack there first
two days ago our rangers spotted teams of men and mules traveling from ceunon into du weldenvarden
we thought they wished to collect timber from the edge of the forest as is often done
tis a practice we tolerate for the humans must have wood and the trees within the fringe are young and nearly beyond our influence and we have not wanted to expose ourselves before
the teams did not stop at the fringe however
they burrowed far into du weldenvarden following game trails they were obviously familiar with
they were searching for the tallest thickest trees trees as old as alagaesia itself trees that were already ancient and fully grown when the dwarves discovered farthen dur
when they found them they began to saw them ** her voice rippled with rage
from their remarks we learned why they were here
galbatorix wanted the largest trees he could acquire to replace the siege engines and battering rams he lost during the battle on the burning plains
if their motive had been pure and honest we might have forgiven the loss of one monarch of our forest
maybe even two
but not eight and twenty
a chill crept through eragon
what did you do he asked although he already suspected the answer
islanzadi lifted her chin and her face grew hard
i was present with two of our rangers
together we corrected the humans mistake
in the past the people of ceunon knew better than to intrude upon our lands
today we reminded them why that was ** without seeming to notice she rubbed her right hand as if it pained her and she gazed past the seeing glass looking at some vision of her own
you have learned what it is like eragon finiarel to touch the life force of the plants and animals around you
imagine how you would cherish them if you had possessed that ability for centuries
we give of ourselves to sustain du weldenvarden and the forest is an extension of our bodies and minds
any hurt it suffers is our hurt as well
we are a slow people to rouse but once roused we are like the dragons we go mad with anger
it has been over a hundred years since i or most any elf shed blood in battle
the world has forgotten what we are capable of
our strength may have declined since the riders fall but we shall still give a full reckoning of ourselves to our enemies it will seem as if even the elements have turned against them
we are an elder race and our skill and knowledge far exceed that of mortal men
let galbatorix and his allies beware for we elves are about to forsake our forest and we shall return in triumph or never again
eragon shivered
even during his confrontations with durza he had never encountered such implacable determination and ruthlessness
it is not human he thought then laughed mockingly to himself
of course not
and i would do well to remember that
however much we may look alike and in my case nigh on identical we are not the same
if you take ceunon he said how will you control the people there they may hate the empire more than death itself but i doubt they will trust you if only because they are humans and you are elves
islanzadi waved a hand
that is unimportant
once we are within the city walls we have ways to ensure that no one will oppose us
this is not the first time we have fought your ** she removed her helm then and her hair fell forward and framed her face between raven locks
i was not pleased to hear of your raid on helgrind but i take it the assault is already over and was successful
then my objections are for naught
i warn you however eragon shur tugal do not imperil yourself on such needlessly dangerous ventures
it is a cruel thing i must say but true nevertheless and it is this your life is more important than your cousin is happiness
i swore an oath to roran that i would help him
then you swore recklessly without considering the consequences
would you have me abandon those i care about if i did that i would become a man to despise and distrust an ill formed vehicle for the hopes of the people who believe i will somehow bring low galbatorix
