his ragged clothes barely covered his pale emaciated body the corners of his bones stood out in sharp relief underneath his translucent skin
his blue veins were also prominent
sores had formed on his wrists where the manacles chafed
the ulcers oozed a mixture of clear fluid and blood
what remained of his hair had turned gray or white and hung in lank greasy ropes over his pockmarked face
roused by the clang of roran is hammer sloan lifted his chin toward the light and in a quavering voice asked who is it who is there his hair parted and slid back exposing his eye sockets which had sunk deep into his skull
where his eyelids should have been there were now only a few scraps of tattered skin draped over the raw cavities underneath
the area around them was bruised and scabbed
with a shock eragon realized that the ra zac had pecked out sloan is eyes
what he then should do eragon could not decide
the butcher had told the ra zac that eragon had found saphira is egg
further more sloan had murdered the watchman byrd and had betrayed carvahall to the empire
if he were brought before his fellow villagers they would undoubtedly find sloan guilty and condemn him to death by hanging
it seemed only right to eragon that the butcher should die for his crimes
that was not the source of his uncertainty
rather it arose from the fact that roran loved katrina and katrina whatever sloan had done must still harbor a certain degree of affection for her father
watching an arbitrator publicly denounce sloan is offenses and then hang him would be no easy thing for her or by extension roran
such hardship might even create enough ill will between them to end their engagement
either way eragon was convinced that taking sloan back with them would sow discord between him roran katrina and the other villagers and might engender enough anger to distract them from their struggle against the empire
the easiest solution thought eragon would be to kill him and say that i found him dead in the cell
his lips trembled one of the death words heavy upon his tongue
what do you want asked sloan
he turned his head from side to side in an attempt to hear better
i already told you everything i **
eragon cursed himself for hesitating
sloan is guilt was not in dispute he was a murderer and a traitor
any lawgiver would sentence him to execution
notwithstanding the merit of those arguments it was sloan who was curled in front of him a man eragon had known his entire life
the butcher might be a despicable person but the wealth of memories and experiences eragon shared with him bred a sense of intimacy that troubled eragon is conscience
to strike down sloan would be like raising his hand against horst or loring or any of the elders of carvahall
again eragon prepared to utter the fatal word
an image appeared in his mind is eye torkenbrand the slaver he and murtagh had encountered during their flight to the varden kneeling on the dusty ground and murtagh striding up to him and beheading him
eragon remembered how he had objected to murtagh is deed and how it had troubled him for days afterward
have i changed so much he asked himself that i can do the same thing now as roran said i have killed but only in the heat of battle
never like this
he glanced over his shoulder as roran broke the last hinge to katrina is cell door
dropping his hammer roran prepared to charge the door and knock it inward but then appeared to think better of it and tried to lift it free of its frame
the door rose a fraction of an inch then halted and wobbled in his grip
give me a hand ** he shouted
i do not want it to fall on her
eragon looked back at the wretched butcher
he had no more time for mindless wanderings
he had to choose
one way or another he had to choose
i do not know what is right realized eragon
his own uncertainty told him that it would be wrong to kill sloan or return him to the varden
he had no idea what he should do instead except to find a third path one that was less obvious and less violent
lifting his hand as if in benediction eragon whispered ** sloan is manacles rattled as he went limp falling into a profound sleep
