i do not know if we should attack or flee
but i do know one thing our children our mothers and our infirm must be protected from danger
the ra zac have barred us from cawley and the other farms down the valley
so what we know this land better than any in alagaesia and there is a place
there is a place where our loved ones will be safe the spine
roran winced as a barrage of outraged voices assaulted him
sloan was the loudest shouting i will be hanged before i set foot in those cursed **
roran said horst overriding the commotion
you of all people should know that the spine is too dangerous it is where eragon found the stone that brought the ra ** the mountains are cold and filled with wolves bears and other monsters
why even mention them
to keep katrina ** wanted to scream
instead he said because no matter how many soldiers the ra zac summon they will never dare enter the spine
not after galbatorix lost half his army in it
that was a long time ago said morn doubtfully
roran jumped on his statement
and the stories have grown all the more frightening in the ** a trail already exists to the top of igualda falls
all we have to do is send the children and others up there
they will only be on the fringe of the mountains but they will still be safe
if carvahall is taken they can wait until the soldiers leave then find refuge in therinsford
it is too dangerous growled sloan
the butcher gripped the edge of the table so hard that the tips of his fingers turned white
the cold the beasts
no sane man would send his family among those
but
roran faltered put off balance by sloan is response
though he knew the butcher hated the spine more than most because his wife had plummeted to her death from the cliffs beside igualda falls he had hoped that sloan is rabid desire to protect katrina would be strong enough to overcome his aversion
roran now understood he would have to win over sloan just like everyone else
adopting a placating tone roran said it is not that bad
the snow is already melting off the peaks
it is no colder in the spine than it was down here a few months ago
and i doubt that wolves or bears would bother such a large group
sloan grimaced twisting his lips up over his teeth and shook his head
you will find nothing but death in the spine
the others seemed to agree which only strengthened roran is determination for he was convinced that katrina would die unless he could sway them
he scanned the long oval of faces searching for a sympathetic expression
delwin i know it is cruel of me to say it but if elmund had not been in carvahall he would still be alive
surely you must agree that this is the right thing to ** you have an opportunity to save other parents from your suffering
no one responded
and ** roran dragged himself toward her clutching the backs of chairs to keep himself from falling
do you want nolfavrell to share his father is fate he has to leave
ca not you see that is the only way he will be safe
though roran did his best to fight it he could feel tears flood his eyes
it is for the ** he shouted angrily
the room was silent as roran stared at the wood beneath his hands struggling to control himself
delwin was the first to stir
i will never leave carvahall so long as my son is killers remain here
however he paused then continued with painful slowness i cannot deny the truth of your words the children must be protected
as i said from the beginning declared tara
then baldor spoke roran is right
we can not allow ourselves to be blinded by fear
most of us have climbed to the top of the falls at one time or another
it is safe enough
i too birgit finally added must agree
horst nodded
i would rather not do it but considering the circumstances
i do not think we have any other ** after a minute the various men and women began to reluctantly acquiesce to the proposal
** exploded sloan
he stood and stabbed an accusing finger at roran
how will they get enough food to wait for weeks on end they can not carry it
how will they stay warm if they light fires they will be ** how how how if they do not starve they will freeze
