when eragon could bear no more saphira swelled her chest and released a low humming growl so deep that it shook the mirror in its frame
the pavilion became as silent as a tomb
her growl was not overtly threatening but it captured everyone is attention and proclaimed her impatience with the proceedings
none of the guests were foolish enough to test her forbearance
with hurried excuses they gathered their things and filed out of the pavilion quickening their pace when saphira tapped the tips of her claws against the ground
nasuada sighed as the entrance flap swung closed behind the last visitor
thank you saphira
i am sorry that i had to subject you to the misery of public presentation eragon but as i am sure you are aware you occupy an exalted position among the varden and i cannot keep you to myself anymore
you belong to the people now
they demand that you recognize them and that you give them what they consider their rightful share of your time
neither you nor orrin nor i can refuse the wishes of the crowd
even galbatorix in his dark seat of power at uru baen fears the fickle crowd although he may deny it to everyone including himself
with the guests departed king orrin abandoned the guise of royal decorum
his stern expression relaxed into one of more human relief irritation and ferocious curiosity
rolling his shoulders beneath his stiff robes he looked at nasuada and said i do not think we require your nighthawks to wait on us any longer
** nasuada clapped her hands dismissing the six guards from the inside of the tent
dragging the spare chair over to nasuada is king orrin seated himself in a tangle of sprawling limbs and billowing fabric
now he said switching his gaze between eragon and arya let us have a full account of your doings eragon shadeslayer
i have heard only vague explanations for why you chose to delay at helgrind and i have had my fill of evasions and deceptive answers
i am determined to know the truth of the matter so i warn you do not attempt to conceal what actually transpired while you were in the empire
until i am satisfied you have told me everything there is to tell none of us shall so much as step outside of this tent
her voice cold nasuada said you assume too much
your majesty
you do not have the authority to bind me in place nor eragon who is my vassal nor saphira nor arya who answers to no mortal lord but rather to one more powerful than the two of us combined
nor do we have the authority to bind you
the five of us are as close to equals as any of us is likely to find in alagaesia
you would do well to remember that
king orrin is response was equally flinty
do i exceed the bounds of my sovereignty well perhaps i do
you are right i have no hold over you
however if we are equals i have yet to see evidence of it in your treatment of me
eragon answers to you and only you
by the trial of the long knives you have gained dominion over the wandering tribes many of which i have long counted among my subjects
and you command as you will both the varden and the men of surda who have long served my family with bravery and determination beyond that of ordinary men
it was you yourself who asked me to orchestrate this campaign said nasuada
i have not deposed you
aye it was at my request you assumed command of our disparate forces
i am not ashamed to admit you have had more experience and success than i in waging war
our prospects are too precarious for you me or any of us to indulge in false pride
however since your investiture you seem to have forgotten that i am still the king of surda and we of the langfeld family can trace our line back to thanebrand the ring giver himself he who succeeded old mad palancar and who was the first of our race to sit on the throne in what is now uru baen
considering our heritage and the assistance the house of langfeld has rendered you in this cause it is insulting of you to ignore the rights of my office
you act as if yours was the only verdict of moment and the opinions of others are of no account to be trampled over in pursuit of whatever goal you have already determined is best for the portion of free humanity that is fortunate enough to have you as their leader
