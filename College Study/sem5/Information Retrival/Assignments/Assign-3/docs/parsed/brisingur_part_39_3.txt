it is strife and anger we must guard against not closer relations with those who were once our foes
remember your distrust of the urgals for they have well earned it but also remember that once dwarves and dragons loved one another no more than humans and urgals
and once dragons fought against the elves and would have driven their race extinct if we could have
once those things were true but no more because people like you had the courage to set aside past hatreds and forge bonds of friendship where previously none existed
nasuada pressed her forehead against the side of saphira is jaw then said you are very wise saphira
amused saphira lifted her head off her paws and touched nasuada on the brow with the tip of her snout
i speak the truth as i see it no more
if that is wisdom then you are welcome to it however i believe you already possess all the wisdom you need
executing othmund may not please the varden but it will take more than this to break their devotion to you
besides i am sure you can find a way to mollify them
aye said nasuada wiping the corners of her eyes with her fingers
i will have to i think
then she smiled and her face was transformed
but othmund was not why i came to see you
eragon just contacted me and asked for you to join him in farthen dur
the dwarves
arching her neck saphira roared toward the sky sending the fire from her belly rippling out through her mouth in a flickering sheet of flame
nasuada staggered back from her while everyone else within earshot froze and stared at saphira
rising to her feet saphira shook herself from head to tail her weariness forgotten and spread her wings in preparation for flight
nasuada is guards started toward her but she waved them back
a patch of smoke swept over her and she pressed the underside of a sleeve over her nose coughing
your enthusiasm is commendable saphira but
is eragon injured or hurt saphira asked
alarm shot through her when nasuada hesitated
he is as healthy as ever nasuada replied
however there was an
incident
yesterday
he and his guards were attacked
saphira held herself motionless while nasuada recalled for her everything eragon had said during their conversation
afterward saphira bared her teeth
durgrimst az sweldn rak anhuin should be grateful i was not with eragon i would not have let them escape so easily for attempting to kill him
with a small smile nasuada said for that reason it is probably better you were here
perhaps saphira admitted and then released a puff of hot smoke and lashed her tail from side to side
it does not surprise me though
always this happens whenever eragon and i part someone attacks him
it is gotten so it makes my scales itch to let him out of my sight for more than a few hours
he is more than capable of defending himself
true but our enemies are not without skill either
impatient saphira shifted her stance raising her wings even higher
nasuada i am eager to be gone
is there anything else i should know
no said nasuada
fly swift and fly true saphira but do not tarry when you arrive in farthen dur
as soon as you leave our camp we shall have only a few days grace before the empire realizes i have not sent you and eragon on a brief scouting trip
galbatorix may or may not decide to strike while you are away but every hour you are absent will increase the possibility
also i would much prefer to have the two of you with us when we attack feinster
we could take the city without you but it will cost us many more lives
in short the fate of the entire varden depends upon your speed
we shall be as swift as the storm driven wind saphira assured her
then nasuada bade her farewell and retreated from the stone slab whereupon blodhgarm and the other elves rushed to saphira is side and strapped her uncomfortable leather patch eragon seat saddle onto her and filled the saddlebags with the food and equipment she would normally carry if embarking upon a trip with eragon
she would not need the supplies she could not even access them herself but for the sake of appearances she had to carry them
once she was ready blodhgarm twisted his hand in front of his chest in the elves gesture of respect and said in the ancient language fare thee well saphira brightscales
