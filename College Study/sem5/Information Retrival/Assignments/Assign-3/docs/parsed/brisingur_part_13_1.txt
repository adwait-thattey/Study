she checked her bandages and satisfied that they were still fresh rang for farica and ordered her to bring a meal
after her handmaid delivered the food and then retired from the tent nasuada signaled elva who emerged from her hiding place behind the false panel at the rear of the pavilion
together the two of them shared a midmorning repast
nasuada spent the next few hours reviewing the varden is latest inventory reports calculating the number of wagon trains she would need to move the varden farther north and adding and subtracting rows of figures that represented the finances of her army
she sent messages to the dwarves and urgals ordered the bladesmiths to increase their production of spearheads threatened the council of elders with dissolution as she did most every week and otherwise attended to the varden is business
then with elva at her side nasuada rode out on her stallion battle storm and met with trianna who had captured and was busy interrogating a member of galbatorix is spy network the black hand
as she and elva left trianna is tent nasuada became aware of a commotion to the north
she heard shouts and cheers then a man appeared from among the tents sprinting toward her
without a word her guards formed a tight circle around her save for one of the urgals who planted himself in the path of the runner and hefted his club
the man slowed to a stop before the urgal and gasping shouted lady ** the elves are ** the elves have **
for a wild improbable moment nasuada thought he meant queen islanzadi and her army but then she remembered islanzadi was near ceunon not even the elves could move a host across the width of alagaesia in less than a week
it must be the twelve spellweavers islanzadi sent to protect eragon
quick my horse she said and snapped her fingers
her forearms burned as she swung herself onto battle storm
she waited only long enough for the nearest urgal to hand her elva then drove her heels into the stallion
his muscles surged beneath her as he sprang into a gallop
bending low over his neck she steered him down a crude lane between two rows of tents dodging men and animals and jumping a rain barrel that barred her way
the men did not seem to take offense they laughed and scrambled after her so they could see the elves with their own eyes
when she arrived at the northern entrance to the camp she and elva dismounted and scanned the horizon for motion
nearly two miles away twelve long lean figures emerged from behind a stand of juniper trees their outlines wavering in the morning heat
the elves ran in unison so light and fast their feet raised no dust and they appeared to fly over the countryside
nasuada is scalp prickled
their speed was both beautiful and unnatural
they reminded her of a pack of predators chasing their prey
she felt the same sense of danger as when she had seen a shrrg a giant wolf in the beor mountains
nasuada started to find angela next to her
she was annoyed and mystified by how the herbalist had been able to sneak up on her
she wished elva had warned her of angela is approach
how is it you always manage to be present when something interesting is about to occur
oh well i like to know what is going on and being there is so much faster than waiting for someone to tell me about it afterward
besides people always leave out important pieces of information like whether someone is ring finger is longer than their index finger or whether they have magical shields protecting them or whether the donkey they are riding happens to have a bald patch in the shape of a rooster is head
do not you agree
nasuada frowned
you never reveal your secrets do you
now what good would that do everyone would get all excited over some piffle of a spell and then i d have to spend hours trying to explain and in the end king orrin would want to chop off my head and i would have to fight off half your spellcasters during my escape
it is just not worth the effort if you ask me
your answer hardly inspires confidence
but
that is because you are too serious lady nightstalker
