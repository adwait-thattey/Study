you and the varden hold nothing but the promise of death for those who have been forced to serve the empire
why could not you have left well enough alone eh dragon rider why could not you have kept your head down so the rest of us could live in peace but no the lure of fame and glory and riches was too great
you had to bring wrack and ruin to our homes so that you could satisfy your ambitions
well i curse you dragon ** i curse you with all my ** may you leave alagaesia and never **
a chill crept over eragon for the man is curse echoed that which the last ra zac had cast upon him in helgrind and he remembered how angela had foretold that very future for him
with an effort he put aside such thoughts and said i do not wish to kill you but i will if i must
lay down your **
arya silently opened the door at the bottom of the leftmost guard tower and slipped inside
stealthy as a hunting wildcat blodhgarm crept behind the soldiers toward the other tower
if any of the men had turned around they would have seen him
the captain of the soldiers spat on the ground by eragon is feet
you do not even look human ** you re a traitor to your race you ** and with that the man raised his shield and hefted his sword and slowly walked toward eragon
shadeslayer growled the soldier
** i d as soon believe my brother is twelve year old son had killed a shade as a youth like you
eragon waited until the captain was only a few feet away
then he took a single step forward and stabbed brisingr through the center of the man is embossed shield through his arm underneath and then through the man is chest and out his back
the man convulsed once and was still
as eragon pulled his blade free of the corpse there was a discordant clamor from within the guard towers as gears and chains began to turn and the massive beams that held closed the city gates began to withdraw
lay down your weapons or ** eragon shouted
bellowing in unison twenty soldiers ran at him brandishing their swords
the others either dispersed and fled toward the heart of the city or else took eragon is advice and placed their swords and spears and their shields on the gray paving stones and knelt by the side of the street with their hands on their knees
a fine mist of blood formed around eragon as he cut his way through the soldiers dancing from one to the next faster than they could react
saphira knocked two of the soldiers over then set another two on fire with a short burst of flame from her nostrils cooking them in their armor
eragon slid to a stop several feet beyond the rearmost soldier and held his position his sword arm outstretched from the blow he had just dealt and waited until he heard the man topple to the ground first one half and then the other
arya and blodhgarm emerged from the guard towers just as the gates groaned and swung outward revealing the blunt and splintered end of the varden is massive battering ram
above the archers on the parapet cried out in dismay and retreated toward more defensible positions
dozens of hands appeared around the edges of the gates and pulled them farther apart and eragon saw a mass of grim faced varden men and dwarves alike crowded in the archway beyond
** they shouted and also ** and welcome ** the hunting is good **
these are my ** eragon said and pointed with brisingr at the soldiers kneeling by the side of the street
bind them and see that they are treated well
i gave my word that no harm would come to them
six warriors hurried to follow his order
the varden rushed forward streaming into the city their jangling armor and pounding boots creating a continuous rolling thunder
eragon was pleased to see roran and horst and several other men from carvahall in the fourth rank of the warriors
he hailed them and roran raised his hammer in greeting and ran toward him
eragon grasped roran is right forearm and pulled him into a rough hug
drawing back he noticed that roran seemed older and hollow eyed compared with before
about time you got here roran grunted
we ve been dying by the hundreds trying to take the walls
