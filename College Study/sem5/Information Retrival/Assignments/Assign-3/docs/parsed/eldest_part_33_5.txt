if you were not my guest here said islanzadi i would strike you down myself for that insult
oromis spread his hands
nay i am not offended
it is an apt reaction
understand orik that glaedr and i cannot fight
glaedr has his disability and i he touched the side of his head i am also maimed
the forsworn broke something within me when i was their captive and while i can still teach and learn i can no longer control magic except for the smallest of spells
the power escapes me no matter how much i struggle
i would be worse than useless in battle i would be a weakness and a liability one who could easily be captured and used against you
so i removed myself from galbatorix is influence for the good of the many even though i yearned to openly oppose him
the cripple who is whole murmured eragon
forgive me said orik
he appeared stricken
it is of no ** oromis placed a hand on eragon is shoulder
islanzadi drottning by your leave
go she said wearily
go and be done with you
glaedr crouched low to the ground and oromis nimbly climbed up his leg and into the saddle on his back
come eragon and saphira
we have much to talk ** the gold dragon leaped off the cliff and circled overhead rising on an updraft
eragon and orik solemnly clasped arms
bring honor to your clan said the dwarf
as eragon mounted saphira he felt as if he were about to embark on a long journey and that he should say farewell to those who remained behind
instead he just looked at arya and smiled letting his wonder and joy show
she half frowned appearing troubled but then he was gone swept into the sky by the eagerness of saphira is flight
together the two dragons followed the white cliff northward for several miles accompanied only by the sound of their wings
saphira flew abreast of glaedr
her enthusiasm boiled over into eragon is mind heightening his own emotions
they landed in another clearing situated on the edge of the cliff just before the wall of exposed stone crumbled back into the earth
a bare path led from the precipice to the doorstep of a low hut grown between the trunks of four trees one of which straddled a stream that emerged from the moody depths of the forest
glaedr would not fit inside the hut could have easily sat between his ribs
welcome to my home said oromis as he alighted on the ground with uncommon ease
i live here on the brink of the crags of tel naeir because it provides me the opportunity to think and study in peace
my mind works better away from ellesmera and the distractions of other people
he disappeared inside the hut then returned with two stools and flagons of clear cold water for both himself and eragon
eragon sipped his drink and admired the spacious view of du weldenvarden in an attempt to conceal his awe and nervousness while he waited for the elf to ** am in the presence of another ** beside him saphira crouched with her eyes fixed on glaedr slowly kneading the dirt between her claws
the gap in their conversation stretched longer and longer
ten minutes passed
half an hour
then an hour
it reached the point where eragon began to measure the elapsed time by the sun is progress
at first his mind buzzed with questions and thoughts but those eventually subsided into calm acceptance
he enjoyed just observing the day
only then did oromis say you have learned the value of patience well
that is good
it took eragon a moment to find his voice
you can not stalk a deer if you are in a hurry
oromis lowered his flagon
true enough
let me see your hands
i find that they tell me much about a ** eragon removed his gloves and allowed the elf to grip his wrists with thin dry fingers
he examined eragon is calluses then said correct me if i am wrong
you have wielded a scythe and plow more often than a sword though you are accustomed to a bow
and you have done little writing or drawing maybe none at all
brom taught me my letters in teirm
mmm
beyond your choice of tools it seems obvious that you tend to be reckless and disregard your own safety
what makes you say that oromis elda asked eragon using the most respectful and formal honorific that he could think of
