the day is almost over and i am afraid her life is measured in hours if not minutes
arya is life is in fate is hands now
you made your choice to stay with murtagh it is too late to change that so stop agonizing over it
you re making my scales itch
the best thing we can do right now is to keep bombarding the ** knew she was right yet her words did nothing to calm his anxiety
he resumed his search for the waterfall but whatever lay before them was hidden by a thick mountain ridge
true darkness began to fill the valley settling over the trees and mountains like an inky cloud
even with her keen hearing and delicate sense of smell saphira could no longer locate the urgals through the dense forest
there was no moon to help them it would be hours before it rose above the mountains
saphira made a long gentle left turn and glided around the mountain ridge
eragon vaguely sensed it pass by them then squinted as he saw a faint white line ** that be the waterfall he wondered
he looked at the sky which still held the afterglow of sunset
the mountains dark silhouettes curved together and formed a rough bowl that closed off the ** head of the valley is not much ** he exclaimed pointing at the ** you think that the varden know we re coming maybe they will send men out to help us
i doubt they will assist us until they know if we are friend or foe saphira said as she abruptly dropped toward the ** am returning to murtagh we should stay with him now
since i can not find the urgals they could sneak up on him without us knowing
eragon loosened zar roc in its sheath wondering if he was strong enough to fight
saphira landed to the left of the beartooth river then crouched expectantly
the waterfall rumbled in the ** comes she said
eragon strained his ears and caught the sound of pounding hooves
murtagh ran out of the forest driving the horses before him
he saw them but did not slow
eragon jumped off saphira stumbling a bit as he matched murtagh is pace
behind him saphira went to the river so she could follow them without being hindered by the trees
before eragon could relay his news murtagh said i saw you dropping rocks with saphira ambitious
have the kull stopped or turned back
they re still behind us but we re almost to the head of the valley
how is arya
she has not died murtagh said harshly
his breath came in short bursts
his next words were deceptively calm like those of a man concealing a terrible passion
is there a valley or gorge ahead that i can leave through
apprehensive eragon tried to remember if he had seen any breaks in the mountains around them he had not thought about murtagh is dilemma for a while
it is dark he began evasively dodging a low branch so i might have missed something but
no
murtagh swore explosively and came to an abrupt stop dragging on the horses reins until they halted as well
are you saying that the only place i can go is to the varden
yes but keep running
the urgals are almost upon **
** said murtagh angrily
he stabbed a finger at eragon
i warned you that i would not go to the varden but you went ahead and trapped me between a hammer and an ** you re the one with the elf is memories
why did not you tell me this was a dead end
eragon bristled at the barrage and retorted all i knew was where we had to go not what lay in between
do not blame me for choosing to come
murtagh is breath hissed between his teeth as he furiously spun away
all eragon could see of him was a motionless bowed figure
his own shoulders were tense and a vein throbbed on the side of his neck
he put his hands on his hips impatience rising
why have you stopped asked saphira alarmed
do not distract ** what is your quarrel with the varden it can not be so terrible that you must keep it hidden even now
would you rather fight the kull than reveal it how many times will we go through this before you trust me
i know said eragon pushing back his ** we have to resolve this
murtagh said eragon earnestly unless you wish to die we must go to the varden
do not let me walk into their arms without knowing how they will react to you
