and now you come bearing hrothgar is mark
it is the ultimate insult to them no matter your service in farthen dur
thus the ring the ultimate challenge
it means durgrimst az sweldn rak anhuin will oppose you with all their resources in every matter big or small
they have set themselves against you utterly declared themselves blood enemies
do they mean me bodily harm asked eragon stiffly
undin is gaze faltered for a moment as he cast a look at gannel then he shook his head and uttered a gruff laugh that was perhaps louder than the occasion warranted
no ** not even they would dare hurt a guest
it is forbidden
they only want you gone gone ** yet eragon still wondered
then undin said please let us talk no more of these unpleasant matters
gannel and i have offered our food and mead in friendship is that not what matters the priest murmured in concordance
it is appreciated eragon finally relented
saphira looked at him with solemn eyes and said they are afraid eragon
afraid and resentful because they have been forced to accept a rider is assistance
aye
they may fight with us but they do not fight for us
