nasuada hoped he would soon recover
if he did not she would ask eragon or angela or perhaps the two of them together to attend to garven
until such time as his condition improved she decided that he should no longer serve as an active member of the nighthawks jormundur would give him something simple to do so she would not suffer guilt at causing him any further injury and he might at least have the pleasure of enjoying whatever visions his contact with the elves had left him with
bitter at her loss and furious with herself with the elves and with galbatorix and the empire for making such a sacrifice necessary she had difficulty maintaining a soft tongue and good manners
when you spoke of peril blodhgarm you would have done well to mention that even those who return to their bodies do not escape entirely unscathed
my lady i am fine said garven
his protestation was so weak and ineffectual hardly anyone noticed and it only served to strengthen nasuada is sense of outrage
the fur on blodhgarm is nape rippled and stiffened
if i failed to explain myself clearly enough before then i apologize
however do not blame us for what has happened we cannot help our nature
and do not blame yourself either for we live in an age of suspicion
to allow us to pass unchallenged would have been negligent on your part
it is regrettable that such an unpleasant incident should mar this historic meeting between us but at least now you may rest easy confident that you have established our origins and that we are what we seem to be elves of du weldenvarden
a fresh cloud of his musk drifted over nasuada and even though she was hard with anger her joints weakened and she was assailed by thoughts of bowers draped in silk goblets of cherry wine and the mournful dwarf songs she had often heard echoing through the empty halls of tronjheim
distracted she said i would eragon or arya were here for they could have looked at your minds without fear of losing their sanity
again she succumbed to the wanton attraction of blodhgarm is odor imagining what it would feel like to run her hands through his mane
she only returned to herself when elva pulled on her left arm forcing her to bend over and place her ear close to the witch child is mouth
in a low harsh voice elva said horehound
concentrate upon the taste of horehound
following her advice nasuada summoned a memory from the previous year when she had eaten horehound candy during one of king hrothgar is feasts
just thinking about the acrid flavor of the candy dried out her mouth and counteracted the seductive qualities of blodhgarm is musk
she attempted to conceal her lapse in concentration by saying my young companion here is wondering why you look so different from other elves
i must confess to some curiosity on the subject as well
your appearance is not what we have come to expect from your race
would you be so kind as to share with us the reason for your more animalistic features
a shiny ripple flowed through blodhgarm is fur as he shrugged
this shape pleased me he said
some write poems about the sun and the moon others grow flowers or build great structures or compose music
as much as i appreciate those various art forms i believe that true beauty only exists in the fang of a wolf in the pelt of the forest cat in the eye of an eagle
so i adopted those attributes for myself
in another hundred years i may lose interest in the beasts of the land and instead decide that the beasts of the sea embody all that is good and then i will cover myself with scales transform my hands into fins and my feet into a tail and i will vanish beneath the surface of the waves and never again be seen in alagaesia
if he was jesting as nasuada believed he showed no indication of it
quite to the contrary he was so serious she wondered if he was mocking her
most interesting she said
i hope the urge to become a fish does not strike you in the near future for we have need of you on dry ground
of course if galbatorix should decide to also enslave the sharks and the rockfish why then a spellcaster who can breathe underwater may be of some use
