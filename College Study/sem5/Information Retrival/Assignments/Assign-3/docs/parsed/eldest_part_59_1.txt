the obsidian seas heaved underneath thedragon wing propelling the ship high in the air
there it teetered on the precipitous crest of a foam capped swell before pitching forward and racing down the face of the wave into the black trough below
billows of stinging mist drove through the frigid air as the wind groaned and howled like a monstrous spirit
roran clung to the starboard rigging at the waist of the ship and retched over the gunwale nothing came up but sour bile
he had prided himself that his stomach never bothered him while on clovis is barges but the storm they raced before was so violent that even uthar is men seasoned tars each and every one had difficulty keeping their whisky down
it felt like a boulder of ice clouted roran between the shoulder blades as a wave struck the ship crossways drenching the deck before draining through the scuppers and pouring back into the frothing furrowed furious ocean from whence it came
roran wiped the salty water from his eyes with fingers as clumsy as frozen lumps of wood and squinted toward the inky horizon to the aft
maybe this will shake them off our ** black sailed sloops had pursued them ever since they passed the iron cliffs and rounded what jeod dubbed edur carthungave and uthar identified as rathbar is spur
the tailbone of the spine that is what it be uthar said grinning
the sloops were faster than thedragon wing weighed down with villagers as it was and had quickly gained upon the merchant ship until they were close enough to exchange volleys of arrows
worst of all it seemed that the lead sloop carried a magician for its arrows were uncannily accurate splitting ropes destroying ballistae and clogging the blocks
from their attacks roran deduced that the empire no longer cared about capturing him and only wanted to stop him from finding sanctuary with the varden
he had just been preparing the villagers to repel boarding parties when the clouds above ripened to a bruised purple heavy with rain and a ravening tempest blew in from the northwest
at the present uthar had thedragon wing tacked crossways to the wind heading toward the southern isles where he hoped to elude the sloops among the shoals and coves of beirland
a sheet of horizontal lightning flickered between two bulbous thunderheads and the world became a tableau of pale marble before darkness reigned once more
every blinding flash imprinted a motionless scene upon roran is eyes that lingered pulsing long after the brazen bolts vanished
then came another round of forked lightning and roran saw as if in a series of monochrome paintings the mizzen topmast twist crack and topple into the thrashing sea port amidships
grabbing a lifeline roran pulled himself to the quarterdeck and in unison with bonden hacked through the cables that still connected the topmast to thedragon wing and dragged the stern low in the water
the ropes writhed like snakes as they were cut
afterward roran sank to the deck his right arm hooked through the gunwale to hold himself in place as the ship dropped twenty
thirty
feet between waves
a swell washed over him leaching the warmth from his bones
shivers racked his body
do not let me die here he pleaded though whom he addressed he knew ** in these cruel waves
my task is yet unfinished
during that long night he clung to his memories of katrina drawing solace from them when he grew weary and hope threatened to desert him
the storm lasted two full days and broke during the wee hours of the night
the following morning brought with it a pale green dawn clear skies and three black sails riding the northern horizon
to the southwest the hazy outline of beirland lay underneath a shelf of clouds gathered about the ridged mountain that dominated the island
roran jeod and uthar met in a small fore cabin since the captain is stateroom was given over to the infirm where uthar unrolled sea charts on the table and tapped a point above beirland
this d be where we are now he said
he reached for a larger map of alagaesia is coastline and tapped the mouth of the jiet river
