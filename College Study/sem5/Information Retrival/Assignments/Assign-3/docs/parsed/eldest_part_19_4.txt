he kicked a loose ** am not sure
brom said you could only scry people places and things that you had already seen
yet i ve never seen this place
nor had i seen arya when i first dreamt about her in teirm
perhaps togira ikonoka will be able to explain it
as they prepared to leave the dwarves seemed much more relaxed now that they were a good distance from tarnag
when they started poling down the az ragni ekksvar who was steering snowfire is raft began chanting in his rough bass
let hand ringer and bearded gaper fill my gri
as i leave the halls of my father
the other dwarves joined ekksvar slipping into dwarvish as they continued on to other verses
the low throb of their voices accompanied eragon as he carefully made his way to the head of the raft where arya sat cross legged
i had a
vision during my sleep said eragon
arya looked at him with interest and he recounted the images he had seen
if it is scrying then
it is not scrying said arya
she spoke with deliberate slowness as if to prevent any misunderstanding
i thought for a long time about how you saw me imprisoned in gil ead and i believe that as i lay unconscious my spirit was searching for help wherever i might find it
arya nodded toward where saphira undulated through the water
i grew accustomed to saphira is presence during the fifteen years i guarded her egg
i was reaching out for anything that felt familiar when i touched your dreams
are you really strong enough to contact someone in teirm from gil ead especially if you were drugged
a ghost of a smile touched arya is lips
i could stand on the very gates of vroengard and still speak with you as clearly as i am ** she paused
if you did not scry me in teirm then you could not have scryed this new dream
it must be a premonition
they have been known to occur throughout the sentient races but especially among magic users
eragon clutched the netting around a bundle of supplies as the raft lurched
if what i sawwill come to pass then how can we change anything that happens do our choices matter what if i threw myself off the raft right now and drowned
but you wo ** arya dipped her left forefinger in the river and stared at the single drop that clung to her skin like a quivering lens
once long ago the elf maerzadi had a premonition that he would accidentally kill his son in battle
rather than live to see it happen he committed suicide saving his son and at the same time proving that the future is not set
short of killing yourself however you can do little to change your destiny since you do not know what choices will lead you to the particular point of time that you ** she flipped her hand and the drop splattered against the log between them
we know that it is possible to retrieve information from the future fortunetellers can often sense the paths a person is life may take but we ve been unable to refine the process to the point where you can choose what where or when you want to see
eragon found the entire concept of funneling knowledge through time profoundly disturbing
it raised too many questions about the nature of ** fate and destiny really exist the only thing i can do is enjoy the present and live as honorably as possible
yet he could not help asking what is to stop me though from scrying one of my memories i ve seen everything in them
so i should be able to view them with magic
arya is gaze darted to meet his
if you value your life never attempt it
many years ago several of our spellweavers devoted themselves to defeating time is enigmas
when they tried to summon up the past they only succeeded in creating a blurred image on their mirror before the spell consumed their energy and killed them
we made no more experiments on the subject
it is argued that the spell would work if more magicians participated but no one is willing to accept the risk and the theory remains unproven
even if one could scry the past it would be of limited use
and to scry the future one would have to know exactly what was going to happen and where and when which defeats the purpose
it is a mystery then how people can have premonitions while sleeping how they can do something unconsciously that has defeated our greatest sages
