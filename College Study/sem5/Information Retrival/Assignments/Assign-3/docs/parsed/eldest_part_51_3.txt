those hard facts weighed upon roran like stones
their venture had always been tenuous at best sustained in equal parts by fear desperation optimism and last minute improvisation
now he feared that he had driven the villagers into the den of their enemies and bound them in place with a chain forged of their own ** could escape alone and continue my search for katrina but what victory would that be if i left my village to be enslaved by the empire whatever our fate in teirm i will stand firm with those who trusted me enough to forsake their homes upon my word
to relieve their hunger they stopped at a bakery and bought a loaf of fresh rye bread as well as a small pot of honey to slather it with
while he paid for the items loring mentioned to the baker is assistant that they were in the market for ships equipment and food
at a tap on his shoulder roran turned
a man with coarse black hair and a thick slab of belly said pardon me for overhearing your parley with the young master but if it is ships and such you be after and at a fair price then i should guess you d want to attend the auction
what auction is this asked roran
ah it is a sad story it is but all too common nowadays
one of our merchants jeod jeod longshanks as we call him out of hearing has had the most abominable run of bad luck
in less than a year he lost four of his ships an when he tried to send his goods over land the caravan was ambushed and destroyed by some thieving outlaws
his investors forced him to declare bankruptcy and now they re going to sell his property to recoup their losses
i do not know bout food but you d be sure to find most everything else you re looking to buy at the auction
a faint ember of hope kindled in roran is breast
when will the auction be held
why it is posted on every message board throughout the city
day after tomorrow to be sure
that explained to roran why they had not learned of the auction before they had done their best to avoid the message boards on the off chance that someone would recognize roran from the portrait on his reward poster
thank you much he said to the man
you may have saved us a great deal of trouble
once roran and his companions filed out of the shop they huddled together on the edge of the street
he said do you think we should look into this
it is all wehave to look into growled loring
you need not ask me it is obvious
we cannot wait until the day after tomorrow though
no
i say we meet with this jeod and see if we can strike a bargain with him before the auction opens
are we agreed
they were and so they set out for jeod is house armed with directions from a passerby
the house or rather mansion was set on the west side of teirm close to the citadel among scores of other opulent buildings embellished with fine scrollwork wrought iron gates statues and gushing fountains
roran could scarcely comprehend such riches it amazed him how different the lives of these people were from his own
roran knocked on the front door to jeod is mansion which stood next to an abandoned shop
after a moment the door was pulled open by a plump butler garnished with overly shiny teeth
he eyed the four strangers upon his doorstep with disapproval then flashed his glazed smile and asked how may i help you sirs and madam
we would talk with jeod if he is free
roran thought the butler knew perfectly well that they did not
our stay in teirm is too brief for us to arrange a proper meeting
ah well then i regret to say that your time would have been better spent elsewhere
my master has many matters to tend
he cannot devote himself to every group of ragged tramps that bangs on his door asking for handouts said the butler
he exposed even more of his glassy teeth and began to withdraw inside
** cried roran
it is not handouts we want we have a business proposition for jeod
the butler lifted one eyebrow
is that so
aye it is
please ask him if he will hear us
we ve traveled more leagues than you d care to know and it is imperative we see jeod today
may i inquire as to the nature of your proposition
very well sir said the butler
