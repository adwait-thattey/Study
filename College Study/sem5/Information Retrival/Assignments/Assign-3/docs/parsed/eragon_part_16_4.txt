he peered around in alarm but nothing had changed
he suddenly realized that the shouts had been inside his head
there was a ** stone ears
relief seeped into ** are you
she sent him an image of a small clump of ** tried to contact you many times but you were beyond reach
i was sick
but i am better now
why could not i sense you earlier
after two nights of waiting hunger bested me
i had to hunt
a young buck
he was wise enough to guard against the predators of land but not those of sky
when i first caught him in my jaws he kicked vigorously and tried to escape
i was stronger though and when defeat became unavoidable he gave up and died
does garrow also fight the inevitable
i do not ** told her the particulars then said it will be a long time if ever before we can go home
i wo not be able to see you for at least a couple of days
you might as well make yourself comfortable
unhappily she said i will do as you say

they parted reluctantly
he looked out a window and was surprised to see that the sun had set
feeling very tired he limped to elain who was wrapping meat pies with oilcloth
i am going back to gertrude is house to sleep he said
she finished with the packages and asked why do not you stay with us you will be closer to your uncle and gertrude can have her bed back
do you have enough room he asked wavering
of ** she wiped her hands
come with me i will get everything ** she escorted him upstairs to an empty room
he sat on the edge of the bed
do you need anything else she asked
he shook his head
in that case i will be downstairs
call me if you need ** he listened as she descended the stairs
then he opened the door and slipped down the hallway to garrow is room
gertrude gave him a small smile over her darting knitting needles

he is weak but the fever is gone down a little and some of the burns look better
we will have to wait and see but this could mean he will recover
that lightened eragon is mood and he returned to his room
the darkness seemed unfriendly as he huddled under the blankets
eventually he fell asleep healing the wounds his body and soul had suffered
