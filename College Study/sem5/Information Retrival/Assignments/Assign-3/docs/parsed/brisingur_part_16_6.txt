eragon and arya presented themselves to nasuada and then to king orrin
nasuada gave them formal welcome on behalf of the varden and praised them for their bravery
she finished by saying aye galbatorix may have a rider and dragon who fight for him even as eragon and saphira fight for us
he may have an army so large that it darkens the land
and he may be adept at strange and terrible magics abominations of the spellcaster is art
but for all his wicked power he could not stop eragon and saphira from invading his realm and killing four of his most favored servants nor eragon from crossing the empire with impunity
the pretender is arm has grown weak indeed when he cannot defend his borders nor protect his foul agents within their hidden fortress
amid the varden is enthusiastic cheering eragon allowed himself a secret smile at how well nasuada played upon their emotions inspiring confidence loyalty and high spirits in spite of a reality that was far less optimistic than she portrayed it
she did not lie to them to his knowledge she did not lie not even when dealing with the council of elders or other of her political rivals
what she did was report the truths that best supported her position and her arguments
in that regard he thought she was like the elves
when the varden is outpouring of excitement had subsided king orrin greeted eragon and arya as nasuada had
his delivery was staid compared with hers and while the crowd listened politely and applauded afterward it was obvious to eragon that however much the people respected orrin they did not love him as they loved nasuada nor could he fire their imagination as nasuada fired it
the smooth faced king was gifted with a superior intellect
but his personality was too rarefied too eccentric and too subdued for him to be a receptacle for the desperate hopes of the humans that opposed galbatorix
if we overthrow galbatorix eragon said to saphira orrin should not replace him in uru baen
he would not be able to unite the land as nasuada has united the varden
at length king orrin concluded
nasuada whispered to eragon now it is your turn to address those who have assembled to catch a glimpse of the renowned dragon ** her eyes twinkled with suppressed merriment
then eragon turned and faced the multitude his tongue dry as sand
his mind was blank and for a handful of panic stricken seconds he thought the use of language would continue to elude him and he would embarrass himself in front of the entire varden
somewhere a horse nickered but otherwise the camp seemed frightfully quiet
it was saphira who broke his paralysis by nudging his elbow with her snout and saying tell them how honored you are to have their support and how happy you are to be back among them
with her encouragement he managed to find a few fumbling words and then as soon as it was acceptable he bowed and retreated a step
forcing a smile while the varden clapped and cheered and beat their swords against their shields he exclaimed that was ** i would rather fight a shade than do that again
** it was not that hard eragon
a puff of smoke drifted up from her nostrils as she snorted with amusement
a fine dragon rider you are afraid of talking to a large ** if only galbatorix knew he could have you at his mercy if he but asked you to make a speech to his troops
ha
it is not funny he grumbled but she still continued to chuckle
