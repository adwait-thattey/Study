in the center of the chamber hurtling downward headfirst was saphira
her jaws were open and from between them erupted a great tongue of flame bright yellow and tinged with blue
on her back was arya hair billowing wildly arm uplifted palm glowing with a nimbus of green magic
time seemed to slow as eragon saw durza tilt his head toward the ceiling
first shock then anger contorted the shade is face
sneering defiantly he raised his hand and pointed at saphira a word forming on his lips
a hidden reserve of strength suddenly welled up inside eragon dredged from the deepest part of his being
his fingers curled around the hilt of his sword
he plunged through the barrier in his mind and took hold of the magic
all his pain and rage focused on one word
zar roc blazed with bloody light heatless flames running along it
he lunged forward
and stabbed durza in the heart
durza looked down with shock at the blade protruding from his breast
his mouth was open but instead of words an unearthly howl burst from him
his sword dropped from nerveless fingers
he grasped zar roc as if to pull it out but it was lodged firmly in him
then durza is skin turned transparent
under it was neither flesh nor bone but swirling patterns of darkness
he shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated splitting his skin
with one last cry durza was rent from head to toe releasing the darkness which separated into three entities who flew through tronjheim is walls and out of farthen dur
the shade was gone
bereft of strength eragon fell back with arms outstretched
above him saphira and arya had nearly reached the floor it looked as if they were going to smash into it with the deadly remains of isidar mithrim
as his sight faded saphira arya the myriad fragments all seemed to stop falling and hang motionless in the air
