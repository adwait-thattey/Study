it was a lesson i thought i had already learned during my time with the varden when one after another the men and women i had come to respect died from swords arrows poison accidents and old age
the loss had never been so personal however and when it happened i thought now i must surely die as ** for whatever danger we had encountered before faolin and i had always survived it together and if he could not escape then why should i
eragon realized she was crying thick tears rolling from the outer corners of her eyes down her temples and into her hair
by the stars her tears appeared like rivers of silvered glass
the intensity of her distress startled him
he had not thought it was possible to elicit such a reaction from her nor had he intended to
then gil ead she said
those days were the longest of my life
faolin was gone i did not know whether saphira is egg was safe or if i had inadvertently returned her to galbatorix and durza
durza sated the bloodlust of the spirits that controlled him by doing the most horrible things he could imagine to me
sometimes if he went too far he would heal me so he could begin anew the following morning
if he had given me a chance to collect my wits i might have been able to fool my jailer as you did and avoid consuming the drug that kept me from using magic but i never had more than a few hours respite
durza needed sleep no more than you or i and he kept at me whenever i was conscious and his other duties permitted
while he worked on me every second was an hour every hour a week and every day an eternity
he was careful not to drive me mad galbatorix would have been displeased with that but he came close
he came very very close
i began to hear birdsong where no birds could fly and to see things that could not exist
once when i was in my cell gold light flooded the room and i grew warm all over
when i looked up i found myself lying on a branch high in a tree near the center of ellesmera
the sun was about to set and the whole city glowed as if it were on fire
the athalvard were chanting on the path below and everything was so calm so peaceful
so beautiful i would have stayed there forever
but then the light faded and i was again on my cot
i had forgotten but once there was a soldier who left a white rose in my cell
it was the only kindness anyone ever showed me in gil ead
that night the flower took root and matured into a huge rosebush that climbed the wall forced its way between the blocks of stone in the ceiling breaking them and pushed its way out of the dungeon and into the open
it continued to ascend until it touched the moon and stood as a great twisting tower that promised escape if i could but lift myself off the floor
i tried with every ounce of my remaining strength but it was beyond me and when i glanced away the rosebush vanished
that was my state of mind when you dreamed of me and i felt your presence hovering over me
small wonder i disregarded the sensation as another delusion
she gave him a wan smile
and then you came eragon
you and saphira
after hope had deserted me and i was about to be taken to galbatorix in uru baen a rider appeared to rescue me
a rider and **
and morzan is son he said
both of morzan is sons
describe it how you will it was such an improbable rescue i occasionally think that i did go mad and that i ve imagined everything since
would you have imagined me causing so much trouble by staying behind at helgrind
no she said
i suppose ** with the cuff of her left sleeve she dabbed her eyes drying them
when i awoke in farthen dur there was too much that needed doing for me to dwell on the past
but events of late have been dark and bloody and increasingly i have found myself remembering that which i should not
it makes me grim and out of sorts without patience for the ordinary delays of ** she shifted into a kneeling position and placed her hands on the ground on either side of her as if to steady herself
you say i walk alone
elves do not incline toward the open displays of friendship humans and dwarves favor and i have ever been of a solitary disposition
