inside one of the huts eragon sat in a chair that was too small for him at a granite table no higher than his knees
the smell of soft goat cheese sliced mushrooms yeast stew pigeon eggs and coal dust pervaded the air
across from him glumra a dwarf woman of the family of mord she who was the mother of kvistor eragon is slain guard wailed and tore at her hair and beat at her breast with her fists
glistening tracks marked where her tears had rolled down her plump face
the two of them were alone in the hut
eragon is four guards their numbers replenished by thrand a warrior from orik is retinue were waiting outside along with hundfast eragon is translator whom eragon had dismissed from the hut once he learned that glumra could speak his language
after the attempt on his life eragon had contacted orik with his mind whereupon orik insisted eragon run as fast as he could to the chambers of the ingeitum where he would be safe from any more assassins
eragon had obeyed and there he had remained while orik forced the clanmeet to adjourn until the following morning on the grounds that an emergency had arisen within his clan that required his immediate attention
then orik marched with his stoutest warriors and most adept spellcaster to the site of the ambush which they studied and recorded with means both magical and mundane
once orik was satisfied they had learned all they could he had hurried back to his chambers where he said to eragon we have much to do and little time in which to do it
before the clanmeet resumes upon the third morning hour of tomorrow we must attempt to establish beyond all doubt who ordered the attack
if we can then we will have leverage to use against them
if not then we will be flailing in the dark uncertain of our enemies
we can keep the attack a secret until the clanmeet but no longer
knurlan will have heard echoes of your fight throughout the tunnels under tronjheim and even now i know they will be searching for the source of the disturbance for fear there may have been a cave in or similar catastrophe that might undermine the city ** orik stamped his feet and cursed the ancestors of whoever had sent the assassins then planted his fists on his hips and said a clan war was already threatening us but now it stands upon our very threshold
we must move quickly if we are to avert that dread fate
there are knurlan to find questions to ask threats to make bribes to offer and scrolls to steal and all before morn
you should remain here until we know if az sweldn rak anhuin or some other clan has a larger force massed elsewhere to kill you
also as long as we can hide from your attackers whether you are alive dead or wounded the longer we may keep them uncertain as to the safety of the rock beneath their feet
at first eragon agreed with orik is proposal but as he watched the dwarf bustle about issuing orders he felt increasingly uneasy and helpless
finally he caught orik by the arm and said if i have to sit here and stare at the wall while you search for the villains who did this i will grind my teeth down to nubs
there must be something i can do to help
what of kvistor do any of his family live in tronjheim has anyone told them of his death yet because if not i would be the one to bring them the tidings for it was me he died defending
orik inquired of his guards and from them they learned that kvistor did indeed have family in tronjheim or more accurately underneath tronjheim
when he heard orik frowned and muttered a strange word in dwarvish
they are deep dwellers he said knurlan who have forsaken the surface of the land for the world below except for occasional forays above
more of them live here below tronjheim and farthen dur than anywhere else because they can come out in farthen dur and not feel as if they are actually outside which most of them cannot bear they are so accustomed to closed in spaces
i had not known kvistor was of their number
would you mind if i go to visit his family eragon asked
among these rooms there are stairs that lead below am i right we could leave without anyone being the wiser
