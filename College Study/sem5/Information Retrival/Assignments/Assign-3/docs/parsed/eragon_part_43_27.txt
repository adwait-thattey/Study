her blood splattered the ground
every time she rushed at one of the urgals they bunched together and jabbed at her eyes forcing her to retreat
she tried to sweep the spears away with her talons but the urgals jumped back and evaded her
the sight of saphira is blood enraged eragon
he swung off tornac with a wild cry and stabbed the nearest urgal through the chest withholding nothing in his frenzied attempt to help saphira
his attack provided the distraction she needed to break free
with a kick she sent an urgal flying then barreled to him
eragon grabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle
murtagh raised his hand then charged into another knot of urgals
by unspoken consent saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies seeking a respite from the madness
eragon is breath trembled
his muscles were clenched ready to ward off the next attack
every fiber of his being thrilled with energy making him feel more alive than ever before
saphira circled long enough for them to recover their strength then descended toward the urgals skimming the ground to avoid detection
she approached the monsters from behind where their archers were gathered
before the urgals realized what was happening eragon lopped off the heads of two archers and saphira disemboweled three others
she took off again as alarms sounded quickly soaring out of bow range
they repeated the tactic on a different flank of the army
saphira is stealth and speed combined with the dim lighting made it nearly impossible for the urgals to predict where she would strike next
eragon used his bow whenever saphira was in the air but he quickly ran out of arrows
soon the only thing left in his quiver was magic which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately needed
saphira is flights over the combatants gave eragon a unique understanding of how the battle was progressing
there were three separate fights raging in farthen dur one by each open tunnel
the urgals were disadvantaged by the dispersal of their forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the tunnels at once
even so the varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from advancing and were slowly being driven back toward tronjheim
the defenders seemed insignificant against the mass of urgals whose numbers continued to increase as they poured out of the tunnels
the urgals had organized themselves around several standards each representing a clan but it was unclear who commanded them overall
the clans paid no attention to each other as if they were receiving orders from elsewhere
eragon wished he knew who was in charge so he and saphira could kill him
remembering ajihad is orders he began relaying information to the twins
they were interested by what he had to say about the urgals apparent lack of a leader and questioned him closely
the exchange was smooth if brief
the twins told him you re ordered to assist hrothgar the fight goes badly for him
saphira swiftly flew to the besieged dwarves swooping low over hrothgar
arrayed in golden armor the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin wielding volund the hammer of his ancestors
his white beard caught the lantern light as he looked up at saphira
admiration glinted in his eyes
saphira landed beside the dwarves and faced the oncoming urgals
even the bravest kull quailed before her ferocity allowing the dwarves to surge forward
eragon tried to keep saphira safe
her left flank was protected by the dwarves but to her front and right raged a sea of enemies
he showed no mercy on those and took every advantage he could using magic whenever zar roc could not serve him
a spear bounced off his shield denting it and leaving him with a bruised shoulder
shaking off the pain he cleaved open an urgal is skull mixing brains with metal and bone
he was in awe of hrothgar who though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves was still undiminished on the battlefield
no urgal kull or not could stand before the dwarf king and his guards and live
every time volund struck it sounded the gong of death for another enemy
