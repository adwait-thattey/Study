wo not you let us up complained eragon
eragon reluctantly turned his head toward murtagh tasting blood in the side of his mouth
murtagh avoided his eyes and looked up at the sky
well is she going to get off us
no not unless we talk
she wants me to ask you what is really the problem said eragon embarrassed
saphira growled an affirmative and continued to stare at murtagh
it was impossible for him to escape her piercing glare
finally he shrugged muttering something under his breath
saphira is claws tightened on his chest and her tail whistled through the air
murtagh shot her an angry glance then grudgingly said louder i told you before i do not want to go to the varden
eragon frowned
was that all that was the matter do not want to
or can not
murtagh tried to shove saphira is leg off him then gave up with a curse
do not want ** they will expect things from me that i can not deliver
did you steal something from them
i wish it were that simple
eragon rolled his eyes exasperated
well what is it then did you kill someone important or bed the wrong woman
no i was born said murtagh cryptically
he pushed at saphira again
this time she released them both
they got to their feet under her watchful eye and brushed dirt from their backs
you re avoiding the question eragon said dabbing his split lip
so what spat murtagh as he stomped to the edge of the camp
after a minute he sighed
it does not matter why i am in this predicament but i can tell you that the varden would not welcome me even if i came bearing the king is head
oh they might greet me nicely enough and let me into their councils but trust me never
and if i were to arrive under less fortuitous circumstances like the present ones they d likely clap me in irons
wo not you tell me what this is about asked eragon
i ve done things i am not proud of too so it is not as if i am going to pass judgment
murtagh shook his head slowly eyes glistening
it is not like that
i have notdone anything to deserve this treatment though it would have been easier to atone for if i had
no
my only wrongdoing is existing in the first ** he stopped and took a shaky breath
you see my father
a sharp hiss from saphira cut him off **
they followed her gaze westward
murtagh is face paled
demons above and **
a league or so away parallel to the mountain range was a column of figures marching east
the line of troops hundreds strong stretched for nearly a mile
dust billowed from their heels
their weapons glinted in the dying light
a standard bearer rode before them in a black chariot holding aloft a crimson banner
it is the empire said eragon tiredly
they ve found us
** saphira poked her head over his shoulder and gazed at the column
yes
but those are urgals not men said murtagh
murtagh pointed at the standard
that flag bears the personal symbol of an urgal chieftain
he is a ruthless brute given to violent fits and insanity
murtagh is eyes tightened
once briefly
i still have scars from that encounter
these urgals might not have been sent here for us but i am sure we ve been seen by now and that they will follow us
their chieftain is not the sort to let a dragon escape his grasp especially if he is heard about gil ead
eragon hurried to the fire and covered it with dirt
we have to ** you do not want to go to the varden but i have to take arya to them before she dies
here is a compromise come with me until i reach the lake kostha merna then go your own ** murtagh hesitated
eragon added quickly if you leave now in sight of the column urgals will follow you
and then where will you be facing them alone
very well said murtagh tossing his saddlebags over tornac is flanks but when we near the varden iwill leave
eragon burned to question murtagh further but not with urgals so near
he gathered his belongings and saddled snowfire
saphira fanned her wings took off in a rush and circled above
she kept guard over murtagh and eragon as they left camp
what direction shall i fly she asked
stilling her wings saphira rose on an updraft and teetered on the pillar of warm air hovering in the sky over the horses
