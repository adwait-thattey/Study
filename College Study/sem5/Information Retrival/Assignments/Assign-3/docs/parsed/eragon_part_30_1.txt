w hat was i thinking wondered eragon in the morning
his head was pounding and his tongue felt thick and fuzzy
as a rat skittered under the floor eragon winced at the noise
how are we feeling asked saphira smugly
a moment later brom rolled out of bed with a grumble
he doused his head in cold water from the basin then left the room
eragon followed him into the hallway
where are you going he asked
i will ** at the bar eragon discovered that brom is method of recovery involved imbibing copious amounts of hot tea and ice water and washing it all down with brandy
when they returned to the room eragon was able to function somewhat better
brom belted on his sword and smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe
the first thing we need to do is ask some discreet questions
i want to find out where the seithr oil was delivered in dras leona and where it was taken from there
most likely soldiers or workmen were involved in transporting it
we have to find those men and get one to talk
they left the golden globe and searched for warehouses where the seithr oil might have been delivered
near the center of dras leona the streets began to slant upward toward a palace of polished granite
it was built on a rise so that it towered above every building except the cathedral
the courtyard was a mosaic of mother of pearl and parts of the walls were inlaid with gold
black statues stood in alcoves with sticks of incense smoking in their cold hands
soldiers stationed every four yards watched passersby keenly
who lives there asked eragon in awe
marcus tabor ruler of this city
he answers only to the king and his own conscience which has not been very active recently said brom
they walked around the palace looking at the gated ornate houses that surrounded it
by midday they had learned nothing useful so they stopped for lunch
this city is too vast for us to comb it together said brom
search on your own
meet me at the golden globe by ** he glowered at eragon from under his bushy eyebrows
i am trusting you not to do anything stupid
i wo not promised eragon
brom handed him some coins then strode away in the opposite direction
throughout the rest of the day eragon talked with shopkeepers and workers trying to be as pleasant and charming as he could
his questions led him from one end of the city to the other and back again
no one seemed to know about the oil
wherever he went the cathedral stared down at him
it was impossible to escape its tall spires
at last he found a man who had helped ship the seithr oil and remembered to which warehouse it had been taken
eragon excitedly went to look at the building then returned to the golden globe
it was over an hour before brom came back slumped with fatigue
did you find anything asked eragon
brom brushed back his white hair
i heard a great deal of interesting things today not the least of which is that galbatorix will visit dras leona within the week
brom slouched against the wall the lines on his forehead deepening
it seems that tabor has taken a few too many liberties with his power so galbatorix has decided to come teach him a lesson in humility
it is the first time the king has left uru baen in over ten years
do you think he knows of us asked eragon
of course heknows of us but i am sure he has not been told our location
if he had we would already be in the ra zac is grasp
however this means that whatever we re going to do about the ra zac must be accomplished before galbatorix arrives
we do not want to be anywhere within twenty leagues of him
the one thing in our favor is that the ra zac are sure to be here preparing for his visit
i want to get the ra zac said eragon his fists tightening but not if it means fighting the king
he could probably tear me to pieces
that seemed to amuse brom
very good caution
and you re right you would not stand a chance against galbatorix
now tell me what you learned today
it might confirm what i heard
eragon shrugged
it was mostly drivel but i did talk with a man who knew where the oil was taken
it is just an old warehouse
other than that i did not discover anything useful
