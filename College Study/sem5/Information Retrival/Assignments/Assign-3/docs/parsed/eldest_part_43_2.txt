when not with oromis eragon supplemented his education by reading the many scrolls the elf gave him a habit he soon became addicted to
eragon is rearing limited as it was by garrow is scant tutelage had exposed him only to the knowledge needed to run a farm
the information he discovered on the miles of paper flooded into him like rain on parched desert sating a previously unknown thirst
he devoured texts on geography biology anatomy philosophy and mathematics as well as memoirs biographies and histories
more important than mere facts was his introduction to alternative ways of thinking
they challenged his beliefs and forced him to reexamine his assumptions about everything from the rights of an individual within society to what caused the sun to move across the sky
he noticed that a number of scrolls concerned urgals and their culture
eragon read them and made no mention of it nor did oromis broach the topic
from his studies eragon learned much about the elves a subject that he avidly pursued hoping that it would help him to better understand arya
to his surprise he discovered that the elves did not practice marriage but rather took mates for however long they wanted whether it be for a day or a century
children were rare and having a child was considered by the elves to be the ultimate vow of love
eragon also learned that since their two races had first met only a handful of elf human couples had existed mainly human riders who found appropriate mates among the elves
however as best he could tell from the cryptic records most such relationships ended in tragedy either because the lovers were unable to relate to one another or because the humans aged and died while the elves escaped the ravages of time
in addition to nonfiction oromis presented eragon with copies of the elves greatest songs poems and epics which captured eragon is imagination for the only stories he was familiar with were the ones brom had recited in carvahall
he savored the epics as he might a well cooked meal lingering overthe deed of geda orthelay of umhodan so as to prolong his enjoyment of the tales
saphira is own training proceeded apace
linked as he was to her mind eragon got to watch as glaedr put her through an exercise regimen every bit as strenuous as his
she practiced hovering in the air while lifting boulders as well as sprints dives and other acrobatics
to increase her endurance glaedr had her breathe fire for hours upon a natural stone pillar in an attempt to melt it
at first saphira could only maintain the flames for a few minutes at a time but before long the blistering torch roared from her maw for over a half hour uninterrupted heating the pillar white hot
eragon was also privy to the dragon lore glaedr imparted to saphira details about the dragons lives and history that complemented her instinctual knowledge
much of it was incomprehensible to eragon and he suspected that saphira concealed even more from him secrets of her race that dragons shared with no one but themselves
one thing he did glean and that saphira treasured was the name of her sire iormungr and her dam vervada which meant storm cleaver in the old speech
while iormungr had been bound to a rider vervada was a wild dragon who had laid many eggs but entrusted only one to the riders saphira
both dragons perished in the fall
some days eragon and saphira would fly with oromis and glaedr practicing aerial combat or visiting crumbling ruins hidden within du weldenvarden
other days they would reverse the usual order of things and eragon would accompany glaedr while saphira remained on the crags of tel naeir with oromis
each morning eragon sparred with vanir which without exception ignited one or more of eragon is seizures
to make matters worse the elf continued to treat eragon with haughty condescension
he delivered oblique slights that on the surface never exceeded the bounds of politeness and he refused to be drawn to anger no matter how eragon needled him
eragon hated him and his cool mannered bearing
it seemed as if vanir was insulting him with every movement
