how was the weather asked his uncle lifting the stone
his hands tightened around it like he was afraid it would suddenly disappear
cold was eragon is reply
it did not snow but it froze each night
garrow looked worried by the news
tomorrow you will have to help roran finish harvesting the barley
if we can get the squash picked too the frost wo not bother ** he passed the stone to eragon
here keep it
when the traders come we will find out what it is worth
selling it is probably the best thing to do
the less we re involved with magic the better
why did horst pay for the meat
it took only a moment for eragon to explain his argument with sloan
i just do not understand what angered him so
garrow shrugged
sloan is wife ismira went over the igualda falls a year before you were brought here
he has not been near the spine since nor had anything to do with it
but that is no reason to refuse payment
i think he wanted to give you trouble
eragon swayed blearily and said it is good to be ** garrow is eyes softened and he nodded
eragon stumbled to his room pushed the stone under his bed then fell onto the **
for the first time since before the hunt he relaxed completely as sleep overtook him
