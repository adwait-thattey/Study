at last i understand the nature of my enemies thought eragon
he had feared the ra zac ever since they first appeared in carvahall not only because of their villainous deeds but because he knew so little about the creatures
in his ignorance he credited the ra zac with more powers than they actually possessed and regarded them with an almost superstitious ** indeed
but now that oromis is explanation had stripped away the ra zac is aura of mystery they no longer seemed quite so formidable
the fact that they were vulnerable to light and water strengthened eragon is conviction that when next they met he would destroy the monsters that had killed garrow and brom
are their parents called ra zac as well he asked
oromis shook his head
lethrblaka we named them
and whereas their offspring are narrow minded if cunning lethrblaka have all the intelligence of a dragon
a cruel vicious and twisted dragon
from whatever land your ancestors abandoned
their depredations may have been what forced king palancar to emigrate
when we the riders became aware of the ra zac is foul presence in alagaesia we did our best to eradicate them as we would leaf blight
unfortunately we were only partially successful
two lethrblaka escaped and they along with their pupae are the ones who have caused you so much grief
after he killed vrael galbatorix sought them out and bargained for their services in return for his protection and a guaranteed amount of their favorite food
that is why galbatorix allows them to live by dras leona one of the empire is largest cities
eragon is jaw tightened
they have much to answer ** and they will if i have my way
that they do oromis agreed
returning to the hut he stepped through the black shadow of the doorway then reappeared carrying a half dozen slate tablets about a half foot wide and a foot high
he presented one to eragon
let us abandon such unpleasant topics for a time
i thought you might enjoy learning how to make a fairth
it is an excellent device for focusing your thoughts
the slate is impregnated with enough ink to cover it with any combination of colors
all you need do is concentrate upon the image that you wish to capture and then say let that which i see in my mind is eye be replicated on the surface of this ** as eragon examined the clay smooth slate oromis gestured at the clearing
look about you eragon and find something worth preserving
the first objects that eragon noticed seemed too obvious too banal to him a yellow lily by his feet oromis is overgrown hut the white stream and the landscape itself
none were unique
none would give an observer an insight into the subject of the fairth or he who had created ** that change and are lost that is what is worth preserving he thought
his eye alighted upon the pale green nubs of spring growth at the tip of a tree is branches and then the deep narrow wound that seamed the trunk where a storm had broken a bough tearing off a rope of bark with it
translucent orbs of sap encrusted the seam catching and refracting the light
eragon positioned himself alongside the trunk so that the rotund galls of the tree is congealed blood bulged out in silhouette and were framed by a cluster of shiny new needles
then he fixed the scene in his mind as best he could and uttered the spell
the surface of the gray tablet brightened as splashes of color bloomed across it blending and mixing to produce the proper array of hues
when the pigments at last stopped moving eragon found himself looking at a strange copy of what he had wanted to reproduce
the sap and needles were rendered with vibrant razor sharp detail while all else was slurred and bleary as if seen through half opened eyes
it was far removed from the universal clarity of oromis is fairth of ilirea
at a sign from oromis eragon handed the tablet to him
the elf studied it for a minute then said you have an unusual way of thinking eragon finiarel
most humans have difficulty achieving the proper concentration to create a recognizable image
you on the other hand seem to observe nearly everything about whatever interests you
