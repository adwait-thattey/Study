normally orik had told eragon the previous night when the clanmeet elects a king or queen the knurla begins their rule at once but we do not hold the coronation for at least three months so that all who wish to attend the ceremony may have time to place their affairs in order and to travel to farthen dur from even the most distant parts of our realm
it is not often we crown a monarch so when we do it is our custom to make much of the event with weeks of feasting and song and with games of wit and strength and contests of skill at forging carving and other forms of art
however these are hardly normal times
eragon stood next to saphira just outside the central chamber of tronjheim listening to the pounding of the giant drums
on either side of the mile long hall hundreds of dwarves crowded the archways of each level peering at eragon and saphira with dark gleaming eyes
saphira is barbed tongue rasped against her scales as she licked her chops which she had been doing ever since she finished devouring five full grown sheep earlier that morning
then she lifted her left foreleg and rubbed her muzzle against it
the smell of burnt wool clung to her
stop fidgeting said eragon
they re looking at us
a soft growl emanated from saphira
i can not help it
i have wool stuck between my teeth
now i remember why i hate eating sheep
horrible fluffy things that give me hair balls and indigestion
i will help you clean your teeth when we are finished here
just hold still until then
did blodhgarm pack any fireweed in the saddlebags that would settle your stomach
mmm
eragon thought for a moment
if not i will ask orik if the dwarves have any stored in tronjheim
we ought to
he cut himself off as the final note from the drums faded into silence
the crowd shifted and he heard the soft rustle of clothes and the occasional phrase of murmured dwarvish
a fanfare of dozens of trumpets rang forth filling the city mountain with its rousing call and somewhere a choir of dwarves began to chant
the music made eragon is scalp tingle and prickle and his blood flow faster as if he were about to embark upon a hunt
saphira whipped her tail from side to side and he knew she felt the same
as one he and saphira advanced into the central chamber of the city mountain and took their place among the ring of clan chiefs guild leaders and other notables who girded the vast towering room
in the center of the chamber rested the reconstructed star sapphire encased within a framework of wooden scaffolding
an hour before the coronation skeg had sent a message to eragon and saphira telling them that he and his team of artisans had just finished fitting together the last fragments of the gem and that isidar mithrim was ready for saphira to make whole once more
the black granite throne of the dwarves had been carried from its customary resting place underneath tronjheim and placed upon a raised dais next to the star sapphire facing the eastern branch of the four main hallways that divided tronjheim east because it was the direction of the rising sun and that symbolized the dawning of a new age
thousands of dwarf warriors clad in burnished mail armor stood at attention in two large blocks before the throne as well as in double rows along either side of the eastern hallway all the way to tronjheim is eastern gate a mile away
many of the warriors carried spears mounted with pennants that bore curious designs
hvedra orik is wife stood at the forefront of the congregation after the clanmeet had banished grimstborith vermund orik had sent for her in anticipation of becoming king
she had arrived in tronjheim only that morning
for half an hour the trumpets played and the unseen choir sang as step by deliberate step orik walked from the eastern gate to the center of tronjheim
his beard was brushed and curled and he wore buskins of the finest polished leather with silver spurs mounted upon the heels gray wool leggings a shirt of purple silk that shimmered in the lantern light and over his shirt a mail hauberk each link of which was wrought of pure white gold
