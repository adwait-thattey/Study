it wo not be much but it will still reduce your stamina by a certain amount
if i do this you will never be able to run as far or lift as many pieces of firewood as someone who does not have a similar incantation leeching off them
why can not you provide the energy asked elva arching an eyebrow
you are the one who is responsible for my predicament after all
i would but the farther away i got from you the harder it would be to send the energy to you
and if i went too far a mile say or maybe a bit more the effort would kill me
as for what can go wrong the only risk is that i will word the counterspell improperly and it wo not block all of my blessing
if that happens i will simply cast another counterspell
and if that falls short as well
he paused
then i can always resort to the first method i explained
i would prefer to avoid that however
it is the only way to completely do away with a spell but if the attempt were to go amiss and it very well might you could end up worse off than you are now
have i your permission to proceed then
when she dipped her chin again eragon took a deep breath readying himself
his eyes half closed from the strength of his concentration he began to speak in the ancient language
each word fell from his tongue with the weight of a hammer blow
he was careful to enunciate every syllable every sound that was foreign to his own language so as to avoid a potentially tragic mishap
the counterspell was burned into his memory
he had spent many hours during his trip from helgrind inventing it agonizing over it challenging himself to devise better alternatives all in anticipation of the day he would attempt to atone for the harm he had caused elva
as he spoke saphira channeled her strength into him and he felt her supporting him and watching closely ready to intervene if she saw in his mind that he was about to mangle the incantation
the counterspell was very long and very complicated for he had sought to address every reasonable interpretation of his blessing
as a result a full five minutes passed before eragon uttered the last sentence word and then syllable
in the silence that followed elva is face clouded with disappointment
i can still sense them she said
nasuada leaned forward in her seat
who
you him her everyone who is in pain
they have not gone away
the urge to help them that is gone but this agony still courses through me
nasuada leaned forward in her throne
eragon
he frowned
i must have missed something
give me a little while to think and i will put together another spell that may do the trick
there are a few other possibilities i considered but
he trailed off troubled by the fact that the counterspell had not performed as expected
moreover deploying a spell specifically to block the pain elva was feeling would be far more difficult than trying to undo the blessing as a whole
one wrong word one poorly constructed phrase and he might destroy her sense of empathy or preclude her from ever learning how to communicate with her mind or inhibit her own sense of pain so she would not immediately notice when she was injured
eragon was in the midst of consulting with saphira when elva said **
an ecstatic glow seemed to emanate from elva
her round pearllike teeth gleamed as she smiled her eyes flashing with triumphant joy
no do not try again
because i do not want any more spells feeding off me
and because i just realized i can ignore ** she gripped the arms of her chair trembling with excitement
without the urge to aid everyone who is suffering i can ignore their troubles and it does not make me ** i can ignore the man with the amputated leg i can ignore the woman who just scalded her hand i can ignore them all and i feel no worse for ** it is true i can not block them perfectly not yet at least but oh what a ** silence
blessed ** no more cuts scrapes bruises or broken bones
no more petty worries of airheaded youths
no more anguish of abandoned wives or cuckolded husbands
no more the thousands of unbearable injuries of an entire war
no more the gut wrenching panic that precedes the final ** with tears starting down her cheeks she laughed a husky warble that set eragon is scalp atingle
