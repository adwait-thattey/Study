the middle of the sword shall be made of a slightly softer steel she touched a cluster of pieces that were grayer and not so bright the better to bend and to absorb the shock of a blow
before the metal can be forged into shape though it must be worked to rid it of the remaining impurities
how is that done asked saphira
that you shall see ** rhunon went to one of the poles that supported the roof of the forge sat with her back against it crossed her legs and closed her eyes her face still and composed
are you ready shadeslayer she asked
i am said eragon despite the tension gathered in his belly
the first thing eragon noticed about rhunon as their minds met was the low chords that echoed through the dark and tangled landscape of her thoughts
the music was slow and deliberate and cast in a strange and unsettling key that scraped on his nerves
what it implied about rhunon is character eragon was not sure but the eerie melody caused him to reconsider the wisdom of allowing her to control his flesh
but then he thought of saphira sitting next to the forge watching over him and his trepidation receded and he lowered the last of the defenses around his consciousness
it felt to eragon like a piece of raw wool sliding over his skin as rhunon enveloped his mind with hers insinuating herself into the most private areas of his being
he shivered at the contact and almost withdrew from it but then rhunon is rough voice sounded within his skull relax shadeslayer and all shall be well
then rhunon began to lift his arms shift his legs roll his head and otherwise experiment with the abilities of his body
strange as it was for eragon to feel his head and limbs move without his direction it was stranger still when his eyes began to flick from place to place seemingly of their own accord
the sensation of helplessness kindled a burst of sudden panic within eragon
when rhunon walked him forward and his foot struck the corner of the forge and it seemed as if he were going to fall eragon immediately reasserted command over his faculties and grabbed the horn of rhunon is anvil to steady himself
do not interfere snapped rhunon
if your nerve fails you at the wrong moment during the forging you could cause yourself irreparable harm
so could you if you re not careful eragon retorted
be patient shadeslayer
i shall have mastered this by the time it is dark
taking the pieces of hard and soft brightsteel she had decided to use rhunon placed them into the forge
at the elf is request saphira heated the steel opening her jaws only a fraction of an inch so that the blue and white flames that poured from her mouth remained focused in a narrow stream and did not spill over into the rest of the workshop
the roaring pillar of fire illuminated the entire atrium with a fierce blue light and made saphira is scales sparkle and flash with blinding brilliance
rhunon had eragon remove the brightsteel from the torrent of flames with a pair of tongs once the metal began to glow cherry red
she laid it on her anvil and with a series of quick blows from a sledgehammer flattened the lumps of metal into plates that were no more than a quarter of an inch thick
the surface of the red hot steel glittered with incandescent motes
as she finished with each plate rhunon dropped it into a nearby trough of brine
having flattened all of the brightsteel rhunon pulled the plates out of the trough the brine warm against eragon is arm and scoured each plate with a piece of sandstone to remove the black scales that had formed on the surface of the metal
the scouring exposed the crystalline structure of the metal which rhunon examined with great attentiveness
she further sorted the metal by relative hardness and purity according to the qualities the crystals displayed
eragon was privy to rhunon is every thought and feeling by reason of their closeness
the depth of her knowledge amazed him she saw things within the metal he had not suspected existed and the calculations she made concerning its treatment were beyond his understanding
