i think even saphira might not be able to overcome such a monster eragon murmured
garzhvog uttered a small grunt
she can breathe fire
a bear cannot
neither of them looked away from the bear until trees hid it from view and even then they kept their weapons at readiness not knowing what other dangers they might encounter
the day had passed into late afternoon when they became conscious of another sound laughter
eragon and garzhvog halted and then garzhvog raised a finger and with surprising stealth crept through a wall of brush toward the laughter
placing his feet with care eragon went with the kull holding his breath for fear his breathing would betray their presence
peering through a cluster of dogwood leaves eragon saw that there was now a well worn path at the bottom of the valley and next to the path three dwarf children were playing throwing sticks at each other and shrieking with laughter
no adults were visible
eragon withdrew to a safe distance exhaled and studied the sky where he spotted several plumes of white smoke perhaps a mile farther up the valley
a branch snapped as garzhvog squatted next to him so that they were about level
garzhvog said firesword here we part
you will not come to bregan hold with me
no
my task was to keep you safe
if i go with you the dwarves will not trust you as they should
thardur mountain is close at hand and i am confident no one will dare hurt you between here and there
eragon rubbed the back of his neck and looked back and forth between garzhvog and the smoke east of them
are you going to run straight back to the varden
with a low chuckle garzhvog said aye but maybe not so fast as we did coming here
unsure of what to say eragon pushed at the rotten end of a log with the tip of his boot exposing a clutch of white larvae squirming in the tunnels they had excavated
do not let a shrrg or a bear eat you eh then i would have to track down the beast and kill him and i do not have the time for that
garzhvog pressed both his fists against his bony forehead
may your enemies cower before you ** standing and turning garzhvog loped away from eragon
the forest soon hid the kull is bulky form
eragon filled his lungs with the fresh mountain air then pushed his way through the wall of brush
as he emerged from the thicket of brakes and dogwood the tiny dwarf children froze the expressions on their round cheeked faces wary
holding his hands out to his sides eragon said i am eragon shadeslayer son of none
i seek orik thrifk is son at bregan hold
can you take me to him
when the children did not respond he realized they understood nothing of his own language
i am a dragon rider he said speaking slowly and emphasizing the words
eka eddyr ai shur tugal
shur tugal
argetlam
at that the children is eyes brightened and their mouths formed round shapes of amazement
** they exclaimed
** and they ran over and threw themselves at him wrapping their short arms around his legs and tugging at his clothes shouting with merriment the entire time
eragon stared down at them feeling a foolish grin spread across his face
the children grasped his hands and he allowed them to pull him down the path
even though he could not understand the children kept up a continuous stream of dwarvish telling him about what he knew not but he enjoyed listening to their speech
when one of the children a girl he thought held her arms out toward him he picked her up and placed her on his shoulders wincing as she grasped fistfuls of his hair
she laughed high and sweet which made him smile again
thus accoutered and accompanied eragon made his way toward mount thardur and there to bregan hold and his foster brother orik
