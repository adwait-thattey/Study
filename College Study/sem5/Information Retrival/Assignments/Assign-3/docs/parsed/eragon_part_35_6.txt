saphira examined the elf ** wonder why she has not woken
it is been hours since we left gil ead
who knows what they did to her said eragon grimly
murtagh followed their gaze
as far as i know she is the first elf the king has captured
ever since they went into hiding he is been looking for them without success until now
so he is either found their sanctuary or she was captured by chance
i think it was chance
if he had found the elf haven he would have declared war and sent his army after the elves
since that has not happened the question is were galbatorix is men able to extract the elves location before we rescued her
we wo not know until she regains consciousness
tell me what happened after i was captured
how did i end up in gil ead
the urgals are working for the empire said murtagh shortly pushing back his hair
and it seems the shade as well
saphira and i saw the urgals give you to him though i did not know who it was at the time and a group of soldiers
they were the ones who took you to gil ead
it is true said saphira curling up next to them
eragon is mind flashed back to the urgals he had spoken with at teirm and the master they had ** meant the ** i insulted the most powerful man in ** he realized with dread
then he remembered the horror of the slaughtered villagers in yazuac
a sick angry feeling welled in his ** urgals were under galbatorix is ** why would he commit such an atrocity on his own subjects
because he is evil stated saphira flatly
glowering eragon exclaimed this will mean ** once the people of the empire learn of it they will rebel and support the varden
murtagh rested his chin in his hand
even if they heard of this outrage few would make it to the varden
with the urgals under his command the king has enough warriors to close the empire is borders and remain in control no matter how disruptive people are
with such a rule of terror he will be able to shape the empire however he wants
and though he is hated people could be galvanized into joining him if they had a common enemy
who would that be asked eragon confused
the elves and the varden
with the right rumors they can be portrayed as the most despicable monsters in alagaesia fiends who are waiting to seize your land and wealth
the empire could even say that the urgals have been misunderstood all this time and that they are really friends and allies against such terrible enemies
i only wonder what the king promised them in return for their services
it would not work said eragon shaking his head
no one could be deceived that easily about galbatorix and the urgals
besides why would he want to do that he is already in power
but his authority is challenged by the varden with whom people sympathize
there is also surda which has defied him since it seceded from the empire
galbatorix is strong within the empire but his arm is weak outside of it
as for people seeing through his deceptions they will believe whatever he wants them to
it is happened ** murtagh fell silent and gazed moodily into the distance
his words troubled eragon
saphira touched him with her mind where is galbatorix sending the urgals
in both carvahall and teirm you heard that urgals were leaving the area and migrating southeast as if to brave the hadarac desert
if the king truly does control them why is he sending them in that direction maybe an urgal army is being gathered for his private use or an urgal city is being formed
eragon shuddered at the ** am too tired to figure it out
whatever galbatorix is plans they will only cause us trouble
i just wish that we knew where the varden are
that is where we should be going but we re lost without dormnad
it does not matter what we do the empire will find us
do not give up she said encouragingly then added dryly though you re probably right
** looked at murtagh
you risked your life to rescue me i owe you for that
i could not have escaped on my ** it was more than that though
there was a bond between them now welded in the brotherhood of battle and tempered by the loyalty murtagh had shown
i am just glad i could help
