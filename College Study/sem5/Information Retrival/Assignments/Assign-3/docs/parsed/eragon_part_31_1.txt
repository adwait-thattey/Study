for a long while eragon was aware only of the burning in his side
each breath was painful
it felt as though he had been the one stabbed not brom
his sense of time was skewed it was hard to tell if weeks had gone by or only a few minutes
when consciousness finally came to him he opened his eyes and peered curiously at a campfire several feet away
his hands were still tied together but the drug must have worn off because he could think clearly ** are you injured
no but you and brom ** was crouched over eragon wings spread protectively on either side
saphira you did not make that fire did you and you could not have gotten out of those chains by yourself
i did not think ** struggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire
the stranger dressed in battered clothes exuded a calm assured air
in his hands was a bow at his side a long hand and a half sword
a white horn bound with silver fittings lay in his lap and the hilt of a dagger protruded from his boot
his serious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair
he appeared to be a few years older than eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller
behind him a gray war horse was picketed
the stranger watched saphira warily
who are you asked eragon taking a shallow breath
the man is hands tightened on his bow
** his voice was low and controlled but curiously emotional
eragon pulled his hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him
he clenched his teeth as his side flared with pain
why did you help us
you are not the only enemies the ra zac have
i was tracking them
eragon concentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic
he hesitated aware of murtagh is eyes on him then decided it did not matter
** he grunted
the ropes snapped off his wrists
he rubbed his hands to get the blood flowing
murtagh sucked in his breath
eragon braced himself and tried to stand but his ribs seared with agony
he fell back gasping between clenched teeth
murtagh tried to come to his aid but saphira stopped him with a growl
i would have helped you earlier but your dragon would not let me near you
her name is saphira said eragon ** let him ** i can not do this alone
besides he saved our lives
saphira growled again but folded her wings and backed away
murtagh eyed her flatly as he stepped forward
he grasped eragon is arm gently pulling him to his feet
eragon yelped and would have fallen without support
they went to the fire where brom lay on his back
how is he asked eragon
bad said murtagh lowering him to the ground
the knife went right between his ribs
you can look at him in a minute but first we d better see how much damage the ra zac did to ** he helped eragon remove his shirt then whistled
**
ouch agreed eragon weakly
a blotchy bruise extended down his left side
the red swollen skin was broken in several places
murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed lightly
eragon yelled and saphira growled a warning
murtagh glanced at saphira as he grabbed a blanket
i think you have some broken ribs
it is hard to tell but at least two maybe more
you re lucky you re not coughing up ** he tore the blanket into strips and bound eragon is chest
eragon slipped the shirt back on
yes
i am ** he took a shallow breath sidled over to brom and saw that murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound
with trembling fingers he undid the bandage
i would not do that warned murtagh
he will bleed to death without it
eragon ignored him and pulled the cloth away from brom is side
the wound was short and thin belying its depth
blood streamed out of it
as he had learned when garrow was injured a wound inflicted by the ra zac was slow to heal
he peeled off his gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words brom had taught ** me saphira he ** am too weak to do this alone
saphira crouched next to him fixing her eyes on ** am here eragon
as her mind joined his new strength infused his body
eragon drew upon their combined power and focused it on the words
his hand trembled as he held it over the wound
waise ** he said
his palm glowed and brom is skin flowed together as if it had never been broken
