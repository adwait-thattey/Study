who gave this to you
it was az sweldn rak anhuin
and not to me but to eragon
as alarm spread across their faces eragon is earlier apprehension returned
he had seen lone dwarves face an entire group of kull without shirking
the ring must symbolize something dreadful indeed if it could undermine their courage
undin frowned as he listened to the muttering of his advisers then said we must consult on this issue
shadeslayer a feast is prepared in your honor
if you would allow my servants to guide you to your quarters you can refresh yourself and then we might begin
of ** eragon handed snowfire is reins to a waiting dwarf and followed a guide into the hall
as he passed through the doorway he glanced back and saw arya and orik bustling away with the clan chiefs their heads pressed close ** wo not be long he promised saphira
after crouching through dwarf sized corridors he was relieved that the room assigned to him was spacious enough to stand freely
the servant bowed and said i will return when grimstborith undin is ready
once the dwarf was gone eragon paused and took a deep breath grateful for the silence
the encounter with the veiled dwarves hovered in his mind making it difficult for him to ** least we wo not be in tarnag long
that should prevent them from hindering us
peeling off his gloves eragon went to a marble basin set on the floor next to the low bed
he put his hands in the water then jerked them out with an involuntary yelp
the water was almost ** must be a dwarf custom he realized
he waited until it cooled a bit then doused his face and neck rubbing them clean as steam swirled off his skin
rejuvenated he stripped out of his breeches and tunic and outfitted himself in the clothes he had worn to ajihad is funeral
he touched zar roc but decided it would only insult undin is table and instead belted on his hunting knife
then from his pack he took the scroll nasuada had charged him with delivering to islanzadi and weighed it in his hand wondering where to hide it
the missive was too important to leave out in the open where it could be read or stolen
unable to think of a better place he slipped the scroll up his ** will be safe there unless i get into a fight in which case i will have bigger problems to worry about
when at last the servant returned for eragon it was only an hour or so past noon but the sun had already vanished behind the looming mountains plunging tarnag into dusk
exiting the hall eragon was struck by the city is transformation
with the premature advent of night the dwarves lanterns revealed their true strength flooding the streets with pure unwavering light that made the entire valley glow
undin and the other dwarves were gathered in the courtyard along with saphira who had situated herself at the head of a table
no one appeared interested in disputing her choice
has anything happened asked eragon hurrying toward her
undin summoned extra warriors then had the gates barred
at the very least he is concerned about the possibility
eragon please join me said undin gesturing at the chair to his right
the clan chief seated himself as eragon did and the rest of the company hurriedly followed suit
eragon was happy when orik ended up beside him with arya directly across the table although both looked grim
before he could ask orik about the ring undin slapped the table and roared ignh az **
servants streamed out of the hall bearing platters of beaten gold piled high with meats pies and fruit
they divided into three columns one for each table and deposited the dishes with a flourish
before them were soups and stews filled with various tubers roasted venison long hot loaves of sourdough bread and rows of honeycakes dripped with raspberry preserve
in a bed of greens lay filleted trout garnished with parsley and on the side pickled eel stared forlornly at an urn of cheese as if hoping to somehow escape back into a river
a swan sat on each table surrounded by a flock of stuffed partridges geese and ducks
mushrooms were everywhere broiled in juicy strips placed atop a bird is head like a bonnet or carved in the shape of castles amid moats of gravy
