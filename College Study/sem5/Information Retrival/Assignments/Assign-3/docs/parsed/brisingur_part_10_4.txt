her guards and companions accompanied her but she paid them little heed eager as she was to rendezvous with eragon and saphira
she had spent much of the previous days worrying about them both as the leader of the varden and somewhat to her surprise as a friend
saphira flew as fast as any hawk or falcon nasuada had seen but she was still a number of miles away from the camp and it took her almost ten minutes to traverse the remaining distance
in that time a massive crowd of warriors gathered around the clearing humans dwarves and even a contingent of gray skinned urgals led by nar garzhvog who spit at the men closest to them
also in the congregation were king orrin and his courtiers who positioned themselves opposite nasuada narheim the dwarf ambassador who had assumed orik is duties since orik left for farthen dur jormundur the other members of the council of elders and arya
the tall elf woman wove her way through the crowd toward nasuada
even with saphira nigh upon them men and women alike tore their gaze from the sky to watch arya is progress she presented such a striking image
dressed all in black she wore leggings like a man a sword on her hip and a bow and quiver on her back
her skin was the color of light honey
her face was as angular as a cat is
and she moved with a slinking muscular grace that bespoke her skill with a blade and also her supernatural strength
her eccentric ensemble had always struck nasuada as slightly indecent it revealed so much of her form
but nasuada had to admit that even if arya donned a gown of rags she would still appear more regal and dignified than any mortal born noble
halting before nasuada arya gestured with one elegant finger at nasuada is wounds
as the poet earne said to place yourself in harm is way for the sake of the people and the country you love is the finest thing one can do
i have known every leader of the varden and they were all mighty men and women and none so much as ajihad
in this though i believe you have surpassed even him
you honor me arya but i fear that if i burn so brightly too few shall remember my father as he deserves
the deeds of the children are a testament of the upbringing they received from their parents
burn like the sun nasuada for the brighter you burn the more people there shall be who will respect ajihad for teaching you how to bear the responsibilities of command at such a tender age
nasuada dipped her head taking to heart arya is advice
then she smiled and said a tender age i am a grown woman by our reckoning
amusement gleamed in arya is green eyes
true
but if we judge by years and not wisdom no human would be considered an adult among my kind
except for galbatorix that is
come now said nasuada you can not be much older than i am
** you re confusing appearances with age
you ought to have more sense than that after being around arya so long
before nasuada could ask just how old angela really was she felt a hard tug on the back of her dress
looking around she saw that it was elva who had taken such a liberty and that the girl was beckoning
bending nasuada placed an ear close to elva who muttered eragon is not on saphira
nasuada is chest tightened restricting her breathing
she peered upward saphira circled directly over the camp some thousands of feet high
her huge batlike wings were black against the sky
nasuada could see saphira is underside and her talons white against the lapped scales of her belly but nothing of whoever might be riding her
how do you know she asked keeping her voice low
i cannot feel his discomfort nor his fears
roran is there and a woman i guess is katrina
no one else
straightening nasuada clapped her hands and said ** allowing her voice to ring forth
jormundur who was almost a dozen yards away came running shoving aside those who got in his way he was experienced enough to know when an emergency was at hand
my lady
clear the ** get everyone away from here before saphira lands
including orrin and narheim and garzhvog
she grimaced
no but allow no one else to remain
**
as jormundur began shouting orders arya and angela converged upon nasuada
