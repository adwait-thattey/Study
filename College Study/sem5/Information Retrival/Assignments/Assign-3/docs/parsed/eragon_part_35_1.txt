it was dark in eragon is cell when he sat up with a start electrified
the wrinkle had ** he had felt the magic at the edge of his consciousness for hours but every time he tried to use it nothing happened
eyes bright with nervous energy he clenched his hands and said nagz ** with a flap the cot is blanket flew into the air and crumpled into a ball the size of his fist
it landed on the floor with a soft thump
exhilarated eragon stood
he was weak from his enforced fast but his excitement overcame his ** for the real test
he reached out with his mind and felt the lock on the door
instead of trying to break or cut it he simply pushed its internal mechanism into the unlocked position
with a click the door creaked inward
when he had first used magic to kill the urgals in yazuac it had consumed nearly all of his strength but he had grown much stronger since then
what once would have exhausted him now only tired him slightly
he cautiously stepped into the ** have to find zar roc and the elf
she must be in one of these cells but there is not time to look in them all
as for zar roc the shade might have it with him
he realized that his thinking was still ** am i out here i could escape right now if i went back into the cell and opened the window with magic
but then i would not be able to rescue the elf
saphira where are you i need your help
he silently berated himself for not contacting her sooner
that should have been the first thing he did after getting his power back
her reply came with surprising ** i am over gil ead
do not do anything
murtagh is on the way
what are footsteps interrupted him
he spun around crouching as a squad of six soldiers marched into the hall
they halted abruptly eyes flicking between eragon and the open cell door
blood drained from their ** they know who i ** i can scare them off so we wo not have to fight
** yelled one of the soldiers running forward
the rest of the men drew their blades and pounded down the hall
it was madness to fight six men when he was unarmed and weak but the thought of the elf kept him in place
he could not force himself to abandon her
uncertain if the effort would leave him standing he pulled on his power and raised his hand the gedwey ignasia glowing
fear showed in the soldiers eyes but they were hardened warriors and did not slow
as eragon opened his mouth to pronounce the fatal words there was a low buzz a flicker of motion
one of the men crashed to the floor with an arrow in his back
two more were struck before anyone understood what was happening
at the end of the hall where the soldiers had entered stood a ragged bearded man with a bow
a crutch lay on the floor by his feet apparently unneeded for he stood tall and straight
the three remaining soldiers turned to face this new threat
eragon took advantage of the confusion
** he shouted
one of the men clutched his chest and fell
eragon staggered as the magic took its toll
another soldier fell pierced through the neck with an arrow
do not kill ** called eragon seeing his rescuer take aim at the last soldier
the bearded man lowered his bow
eragon concentrated on the soldier before him
the man was breathing hard the whites of his eyes showed
he seemed to understand that his life was being spared
you ve seen what i can do said eragon harshly
if you do not answer my questions the rest of your life will be spent in utter misery and torment
now where is my sword its sheath and blade are red and what cell is the elf in
the man clamped his mouth shut
eragon is palm glowed ominously as he reached for the magic
that was the wrong answer he snapped
do you know how much pain a grain of sand can cause you when it is embedded red hot in your stomach especially when it does not cool off for the next twenty years and slowly burns its way down to your ** by the time it gets out of you you will be an old ** he paused for effect
unless you tell me what i want
the soldier is eyes bulged but he remained silent
eragon scraped some dirt off the stone floor and observed dispassionately this is a bit more than a piece of sand but be comforted it will burn through you faster
