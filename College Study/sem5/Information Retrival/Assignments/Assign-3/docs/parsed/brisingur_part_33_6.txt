and so many of them fear the world beyond the mountains and the tunnels and caverns wherein we ** he turned his mug around on the table
nado and az sweldn rak anhuin are only worsening the situation
they play upon people is fears and poison their minds against you the varden and king orrin
az sweldn rak anhuin is the epitome of what we must overcome if i am to be king
somehow we must needs find a way to allay their concerns and the concerns of those like them for even if i am king i will have to give them a fair hearing if i am to retain the support of the clans
a dwarf king or queen is always at the mercy of the clans no matter how strong a ruler they may be just as the grimstborithn are at the mercy of the families of their ** tilting back his head orik drained the last of the beer from his mug then set it down with a sharp clack
is there anything i could do any custom or ceremony of yours i could perform that would appease vermund and his followers asked eragon naming the current grimstborith of az sweldn rak anhuin
there must be something i can do to put their suspicions to rest and bring this feud to an end
orik laughed and stood from the table
you could die
at the moment galdhiem grimstborith of durgrimst feldunost was speaking
he was short even for a dwarf hardly more than two feet in height and wore patterned robes of gold russet and midnight blue
unlike the dwarves of the ingeitum he did not trim or braid his beard and it tumbled across his chest like a tangled bramble
standing on the seat of his chair he pounded the polished table with his gloved fist and roared
** narho udim etal os isu ** narho udim etal os formvn mendunost brakn az varden hrestvog dur ** az jurgenvren qathrid ne domar oen etal
no eragon is translator a dwarf named hundfast whispered in his ear
i will not let that happen
i will not let these beardless fools the varden destroy our country
the dragon war left us weak and not
eragon stifled a yawn bored
he allowed his gaze to drift around the granite table from galdhiem to nado a round faced dwarf with flaxen hair who was nodding with approval at galdhiem is thundering speech to havard who was using a dagger to clean under the fingernails of the two remaining fingers on his right hand to vermund heavy browed but otherwise inscrutable behind his purple veil to gannel and undin who sat leaning toward each other whispering while hadfala an elderly dwarf woman who was the clan chief of durgrimst ebardac and the third member of gannel is alliance frowned at the sheaf of rune covered parchment she brought with her to every meeting and then to the chief of dur grimst ledwonnu manndrath who sat in profile to eragon displaying his long drooping nose to good effect to thordris grimstborith of durgrimst nagra of whom he could see little but her wavy auburn hair which fell past her shoulders and lay coiled on the floor in a braid twice as long as she was tall to the back of orik is head as he slouched to one side in his chair to freowin grimstborith of durgrimst gedthrall an immensely corpulent dwarf who kept his eyes fixed upon the block of wood he was busy carving into the likeness of a hunched raven and then to hreidamar grimstborith of durgrimst urzhad who in contrast with freowin was fit and compact with corded forearms and who wore a mail hauberk and helm to every gathering and finally to iorunn she of the nut brown skin marred only by a thin crescent shaped scar high upon her left cheekbone she of the satin bright hair bound underneath a silver helm wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf is head she of the vermilion dress and the necklace of flashing emeralds set in squares of gold carved with lines of arcane runes
iorunn noticed eragon looking at her
a lazy smile appeared on her lips
with voluptuous ease she winked at eragon obscuring one of her almond shaped eyes for a pair of heartbeats
eragon is cheeks stung as blood suffused them and the tips of his ears burned
he shifted his gaze and returned it to galdhiem who was still busy pontificating his chest puffed out like that of a strutting pigeon
