oh eragon
i d hoped you could see past your hate
what else would you do in my position she sighed when he remained silent
if anyone has cause to hold a grudge against the urgals it is i
they killed my father
yet i cannot allow that to interfere with deciding what is best for the varden
at least ask saphira is opinion before you say yea or nay
i can order you to accept the urgals protection but i would rather not
you re being foolish observed saphira without prompting
foolish to not want kull watching my back
no foolish to refuse help no matter where it comes from in our present situation
think
you know what oromis would do and you know what he would say
do not you trust his judgment
he can not be right about everything said eragon
that is no argument
search yourself eragon and tell me whether i speak the truth
you know the correct path
i would be disappointed if you could not bring yourself to embrace it
saphira and nasuada is cajoling only made eragon more reluctant to agree
still he knew he had no choice
all right i will let them guard me but only if i find nothing suspicious in their minds
will you promise that after this battle you wo not make me work with an urgal again
nasuada shook her head
i can not do that not when it might hurt the ** she paused and said oh and eragon
in the event of my death i have chosen you as my successor
if that should happen i suggest you rely upon jormundur is advice he has more experience than the other members of the council of elders and i would expect you to place the welfare of those underneath you before all else
am i clear eragon
her announcement caught him by surprise
nothing meant more to her than the varden
offering it to him was the greatest act of trust she could make
her confidence humbled and touched him he bowed his head
i would strive to be as good a leader as you and ajihad have been
you honor me nasuada
yes i ** turning away from him she rejoined the others
still overwhelmed by nasuada is revelation and finding his anger tempered by it eragon slowly walked back to saphira
he studied garzhvog and the other urgals trying to gauge their mood but their features were so different from those he was accustomed to he could discern nothing more than the broadest of emotions
nor could he find any empathy within himself for the urgals
to him they were feral beasts that would kill him as soon as not and were incapable of love kindness or even true intelligence
in short they were lesser beings
deep within his mind saphira whispered i am sure galbatorix is of the same opinion
and for good reason he growled intending to shock her
suppressing his revulsion he said out loud nar garzhvog i am told that the four of you agreed to allow me within your minds
that is so firesword
lady nightstalker told us what was required
we are honored to have the chance to battle alongside such a mighty warrior and one who has done so much for us
what do you mean i have killed scores of your ** unbidden excerpts from one of oromis is scrolls rose in eragon is memory
he remembered reading that urgals both male and female determined their rank in society through combat and that it was this practice above all else that had led to so many conflicts between urgals and other races
which meant he realized that if they admired his feats in battle then they may have accorded him the same status as one of their war chiefs
by killing durza you freed us from his control
we are in your debt firesword
none of our rams will challenge you and if you visit our halls you and the dragon flametongue will be welcomed as no outsiders ever before
of all the responses eragon had expected gratitude was the last and it was the one he was least prepared to deal with
unable to think of anything else he said i wo not ** he switched his gaze to the other urgals then returned it to garzhvog and his yellow eyes
are you ready
as eragon reached toward garzhvog is consciousness it reminded him of how the twins invaded his mind when he first entered farthen dur
that observation was swept away as he immersed himself in the urgal is identity
