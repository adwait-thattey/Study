murtagh bore a similar mark
it was inflicted when his father morzan threw zar roc at him while he was only a child
oromis stared at him seriously for a long time before he nodded and moved on
you have a fair amount of muscle and you are not as lopsided as most swordsmen
are you ambidextrous
not really but i had to teach myself to fight with my left hand after i broke my wrist by teirm
good
that will save some time
clasp your hands behind your back and lift them as high as ** eragon did as he was told but the posture hurt his shoulders and he could barely make his hands meet
now bend forward while keeping your knees straight
try to touch the ** this was even harder for eragon he ended up bowed like a hunchback with his arms hanging uselessly by his head while his hamstrings twinged and burned
his fingers were still nine or ten inches from the ground
at least you can stretch without hurting yourself
i had not hoped for so much
you can perform a number of exercises for flexibility without overexerting
yes
then oromis addressed saphira i would know your capabilities as well ** he gave her a number of complex poses that had her contort every foot of her sinuous length in fantastic ways culminating in a series of aerial acrobatics the likes of which eragon had never seen before
only a few things exceeded her ability such as executing a backward loop while corkscrewing through the air
when she landed it was glaedr who said i fear that we coddled the riders
if our hatchlings had been forced to care for themselves in the wild as you were and so our ancestors were then perhaps they would have possessed your skill
no said oromis even if saphira had been raised on vroengard using the established methods she would still be an extraordinary flier
i ve rarely seen a dragon so naturally suited to the ** saphira blinked then shuffled her wings and busied herself cleaning one of her claws in a manner that hid her head from view
you have room to improve as do we all but little very ** the elf reseated himself his back perfectly straight
for the next five hours by eragon is reckoning oromis delved into every aspect of his and saphira is knowledge from botany to woodworking to metallurgy and medicine although he mainly concentrated on their grasp of history and the ancient language
the interrogation comforted eragon as it reminded him of how brom used to quiz him during their long treks to teirm and dras leona
when they broke for lunch oromis invited eragon into his house leaving the two dragons alone
the elf is quarters were barren except for those few essentials necessary for food hygiene and the pursuit of an intellectual life
two entire walls were dotted with cubbyholes that held hundreds of scrolls
next to the table hung a golden sheath the same color as glaedr is scales and a matching sword with a blade the color of iridescent bronze
on the inner pane of the door set within the heart of the wood was a flat panel one span high and two wide
it depicted a beautiful towering city built against an escarpment and caught in the ruddy light of a rising harvest moon
the pitted lunar face was bisected by the horizon and appeared to sit on the ground like a maculated dome as large as a mountain
the picture was so clear and perfectly detailed eragon at first took it to be a magical window it was only when he saw that the image was indeed static that he could accept it as a piece of art
oromis is slanted features tightened for an instant
you would do well to memorize that landscape eragon for there lies the heart of your misery
you see what was once our city of ilirea
it was burned and abandoned during du fyrn skulblaka and became the capital of the broddring kingdom and now is the black city of uru baen
i made that fairth on the night that i and others were forced to flee our home before galbatorix arrived
you painted this
fairth
no no such thing
a fairth is an image fixed by magic upon a square of polished slate that is prepared beforehand with layers of pigments
the landscape upon that door is exactly how ilirea presented itself to me at the moment i uttered my spell
