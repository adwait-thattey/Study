wake ** you cannot sleep now
we are needed at the gate they wo not start without us
eragon forced his eyes open conscious of an aching head and sore body
he was lying on a cold stone table
what he grimaced at the sick taste on his tongue
orik tugged on his brown beard
ajihad is procession
we must be present for **
no what did you call me they were still in the banquet hall but it was empty except for him orik and saphira who lay on her side between two tables
she stirred and lifted her head looking around with bleary eyes
** i called you stonehead because i ve been trying to wake you for almost an hour
eragon pushed himself upright and slid off the table
flashes of memory from the night before jumped through his ** how are you he asked stumbling to her
she swiveled her head running her crimson tongue in and out over her teeth like a cat that ate something **
i think
my left wing feels a bit strange i think it is the one i landed on
and my head is filled with a thousand hot arrows
was anyone hurt when she fell asked eragon concerned
a hearty chuckle exploded from the dwarf is thick chest
only those who dropped off their seats from laughing so hard
a dragon getting drunk and bowing at ** i am sure lays will be sung about it for ** saphira shuffled her wings and looked away primly
we thought it best to leave you here since we could not move you saphira
it upset the head cook terribly he feared you would drink more of his best stock than the four barrels you already did
and you chastisedmeonce for ** if i consumed four barrels it would kill me
that is why you re not a dragon
orik thrust a bundle of clothes into eragon is arms
here put these on
they are more appropriate for a funeral than your own attire
but hurry we have little ** eragon struggled into the items a billowy white shirt with ties at the cuffs a red vest decorated with gold braiding and embroidery dark pants shiny black boots that clacked on the floor and a swirling cape that fastened under his throat with a studded brooch
in place of the usual plain leather band zar roc was fastened to an ornate belt
eragon splashed his face with water and tried to arrange his hair neatly
then orik rushed him and saphira out of the hall and toward tronjheim is south gate
we must start from there he explained moving with surprising speed on his stocky legs because that is where the procession with ajihad is body stopped three days ago
his journey to the grave cannot be interrupted or else his spirit will find no rest
eragon agreed noting a slight unsteadiness in her gait
in carvahall people were usually buried on their farm or if they lived in the village in a small graveyard
the only rituals that accompanied the process were lines recited from certain ballads and a death feast held afterward for relatives and ** you make it through the whole funeral he asked as saphira staggered again
she grimaced ** and nasuada is appointment but then i will need to sleep
a pox on all mead
returning to his conversation with orik eragon asked where will ajihad be buried
orik slowed and glanced at eragon with caution
that has been a matter of contention among the clans
when a dwarf dies we believe he must be sealed in stone or else he will never join his ancestors
it is complex and i cannot say more to an outsider
but we go to great lengths to assure such a burial
shame falls on a family or clan if they allow any of their own to lie in a lesser element
under farthen dur exists a chamber that is the home of all knurlan all dwarves who have died here
it is there ajihad will be taken
he cannot be entombed with us as he is human but a hallowed alcove has been set aside for him
there the varden may visit him without disturbing our sacred grottos and ajihad will receive the respect he is due
your king has done much for the varden commented eragon
before the thick gate drawn up on its hidden chains to reveal faint daylight drifting into farthen dur they found a carefully arranged column
ajihad lay at the front cold and pale on a white marble bier borne by six men in black armor
