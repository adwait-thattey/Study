they will never rise again not even if galbatorix is other eggs were to hatch
a shadow crossed his face as he gazed at eragon is side
i see that you carry an enemy is sword i was told of this and that you travel with a son of the forsworn
it does not please me to see this ** he extended a hand
i would like to examine it
eragon drew zar roc and presented it to the king hilt first
hrothgar grasped the sword and ran a practiced eye over the red blade
the edge caught the lantern light reflecting it sharply
the dwarf king tested the point with his palm then said a masterfully forged blade
elves rarely choose to make swords they prefer bows and spears but when they do the results are unmatched
this is an ill fated blade i am not glad to see it within my realm
but carry it if you will perhaps its luck has ** he returned zar roc and eragon sheathed it
has my nephew proved helpful during your time here
hrothgar raised a tangled eyebrow
orik my youngest sister is son
he is been serving under ajihad to show my support for the varden
it seems that he has been returned to my command however
i was gratified to hear that you defended him with your words
eragon understood that this was another sign of otho of faith on hrothgar is part
i could not ask for a better guide
that is good said the king clearly pleased
unfortunately i cannot speak with you much longer
my advisors wait for me as there are matters i must deal with
i will say this though if you wish the support of the dwarves within my realm you must first prove yourself to them
we have long memories and do not rush to hasty decisions
words will decide nothing only deeds
i will keep that in mind said eragon bowing again
hrothgar nodded regally
you may go then
eragon turned with saphira and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king
orik was waiting for them on the other side of the stone doors an anxious expression on his face
he fell in with them as they climbed back up to tronjheim is main chamber
did all go well were you received favorably
i think so
but your king is cautious said eragon
that is how he has survived this long
i would not want hrothgar angry at us observed saphira
eragon glanced at ** i would not either
i am not sure what he thought of you he seems to disapprove of dragons though he did not say it outright
that seemed to amuse ** that he is wise especially since he is barely knee high to me
in tronjheim is center under the sparkling isidar mithrim orik said your blessing yesterday has stirred up the varden like an overturned beehive
the child saphira touched has been hailed as a future hero
she and her guardian have been quartered in the finest rooms
everyone is talking about your ** all the human mothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children
alarmed eragon furtively looked around
what should we do
aside from taking back your actions asked orik dryly
stay out of sight as much as possible
everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold so you wo not be disturbed there
eragon did not want to return to the dragonhold yet
it was early in the day and he wanted to explore tronjheim with saphira
now that they were out of the empire there was no reason for them to be apart
but he wanted to avoid attention which would be impossible with her at his ** what do you want to do
she nosed him scales brushing his ** will return to the dragonhold
there is someone there i want to meet
wander around as long as you like
all right he said but who do you want to meet saphira only winked a large eye at him before padding down one of tronjheim is four main tunnels
eragon explained to orik where she was going then said i d like some breakfast
and then i d like to see more of tronjheim it is such an incredible place
i do not want to go to the training grounds until tomorrow as i am still not fully recovered
orik nodded his beard bobbing on his chest
in that case would you like to visit tronjheim is library it is quite old and contains many scrolls of great value
you might find it interesting to read a history of alagaesia that has not been tainted by galbatorix is hand
