he did not care how valuable the stone might be he was going to take it far away and bury it
the rocking stopped the stone became quiet
it quivered then rolled forward and dropped onto the floor with a loud thump
he inched toward the door in alarm as the stone wobbled toward him
suddenly a crack appeared on the stone
then another and another
transfixed eragon leaned forward still holding the knife
at the top of the stone where all the cracks met a small piece wobbled as if it were balanced on something then rose and toppled to the floor
after another series of squeaks a small dark head poked out of the hole followed by a weirdly angled body
eragon gripped the knife tighter and held very still
soon the creature was all the way out of the stone
it stayed in place for a moment then skittered into the moonlight
eragon recoiled in shock
standing in front of him licking off the membrane that encased it was a dragon
