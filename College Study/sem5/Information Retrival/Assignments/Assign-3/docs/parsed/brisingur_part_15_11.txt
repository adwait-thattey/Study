the lights hurtled into the camp and formed a whirling wall around him and arya
the speed with which they spun combined with the barrage of pulsing colors made eragon dizzy
he put a hand on the ground to steady himself
the humming was so loud now his teeth vibrated against one another
he tasted metal and his hair stood on end
arya is did the same despite its additional length and when he glanced at her he found the sight so ridiculous he had to resist the urge to laugh
what do they want shouted eragon but she did not answer
a single orb detached itself from the wall and hung before arya at eye level
it shrank and expanded like a throbbing heart alternating between royal blue and emerald green with occasional flashes of red
one of its tendrils caught hold of a strand of arya is hair
there was a sharp pop and for an instant the strand shone like a fragment of the sun then it vanished
the smell of burnt hair drifted toward eragon
arya did not flinch or otherwise betray alarm
her face calm she lifted an arm and before eragon could leap forward and stop her laid her hand upon the lambent orb
the orb turned gold and white and it swelled until it was over three feet across
arya closed her eyes and tilted her head back radiant joy suffusing her features
her lips moved but whatever she said eragon could not hear
when she finished the orb flushed blood red and then in quick succession shifted from red to green to purple to a ruddy orange to a blue so bright he had to avert his gaze and then to pure black fringed with a corona of twisting white tendrils like the sun during an eclipse
its appearance ceased to fluctuate then as if only the absence of color could adequately convey its mood
drifting away from arya it approached eragon a hole in the fabric of the world encircled by a crown of flames
it hovered in front of him humming with such intensity his eyes watered
his tongue seemed plated with copper his skin crawled and short filaments of electricity danced on the tips of his fingers
somewhat frightened he wondered whether he should touch the orb as arya had
he looked at her for advice
she nodded and gestured for him to proceed
he extended his right hand toward the void that was the orb
to his surprise he encountered resistance
the orb was incorporeal but it pushed against his hand the way a swift stream of water might
the closer he got the harder it pushed
with an effort he reached across the last few inches and came into contact with the center of the creature is being
bluish rays shot out from between eragon is palm and the surface of the orb a dazzling fanlike display that overwhelmed the light from the other orbs and bleached everything a pale blue white
eragon shouted with pain as the rays stabbed at his eyes and he ducked his head squinting
then something moved inside the orb like a sleeping dragon uncoiling and a presence entered his mind brushing aside his defenses as if they were dry leaves in an autumn storm
he gasped
transcendent joy filled him whatever the orb was it seemed to be composed of distilled happiness
it enjoyed being alive and everything around it pleased it to a greater or lesser degree
eragon would have wept with sheer gladness but he no longer had control of his body
the creature held him in place the shimmering rays still blazing from underneath his hand while it flitted through his bones and muscles lingering at the sites where he had been injured and then returned to his mind
euphoric as eragon was the creature is presence was so strange and so unearthly he wanted to flee from it but inside his consciousness there was nowhere to hide
he had to remain in intimate contact with the fiery soul of the creature while it scoured his memories dashing from one to the next with the speed of an elvish arrow
he wondered how it could comprehend so much information so quickly
while it searched he tried to probe the orb is mind in return to learn what he could about its nature and its origins but it defied his attempts to understand it
the few impressions he gleaned were so different from those he had found in the minds of other beings they were incomprehensible
