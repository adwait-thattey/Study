saphira remained upright
the king stirred as if awakening from a long sleep and rumbled rise rider you need not pay tribute to me
straightening eragon met hrothgar is impenetrable eyes
the king inspected him with a hard gaze then said gutturally az knurl deimi ** beware the rock changes an old dictum of ours
and nowadays the rock changes very fast ** he fingered the war hammer
i could not meet with you earlier as ajihad did because i was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans
they demanded that i deny you sanctuary and expel you from farthen dur
it has taken much work on my part to convince them otherwise
thank you said eragon
i did not anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause
the king accepted his thanks then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed
see there rider eragon where my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones
one and forty there are with i the forty second
when i pass from this world into the care of the gods my hirna will be added to their ranks
the first statue is the likeness of my ancestor korgan who forged this mace volund
for eight millennia since the dawn of our race dwarves have ruled under farthen dur
we are the bones of the land older than both the fair elves and the savage ** saphira shifted slightly
hrothgar leaned forward his voice gravelly and deep
i am old human even by our reckoning old enough to have seen the riders in all their fleeting glory old enough to have spoken with their last leader vrael who paid tribute to me within these very walls
few are still alive who can claim that much
i remember the riders and how they meddled in our affairs
i also remember the peace they kept that made it possible to walk unharmed from tronjheim to narda
and now you stand before me a lost tradition revived
tell me and speak truly in this why have you come to farthen dur i know of the events that made you flee the empire but what is your intent now
for now saphira and i merely want to recuperate in tronjheim eragon replied
we are not here to cause trouble only to find sanctuary from the dangers we ve faced for many months
ajihad may send us to the elves but until he does we have no wish to leave
then was it only the desire for safety that drove you asked hrothgar
do you just seek to live here and forget your troubles with the empire
eragon shook his head his pride rejecting that statement
if ajihad told you of my past you should know that i have grievances enough to fight the empire until it is nothing but scattered ashes
more than that though
i want to aid those who cannot escape galbatorix including my cousin
i have the strength to help so i must
the king seemed satisfied by his answer
he turned to saphira and asked dragon what think you in this matter for what reason have you come
saphira lifted the edge of her lip to ** him that i thirst for the blood of our enemies and eagerly await the day when we ride to battle against galbatorix
i ve no love or mercy for traitors and egg breakers like that false king
he held me for over a century and even now still has two of my brethren whom i would free if possible
and tell hrothgar i think you ready for this task
eragon grimaced at her words but dutifully relayed them
the corner of hrothgar is mouth lifted in a hint of grim amusement deepening his wrinkles
i see that dragons have not changed with the ** he rapped the throne with a knuckle
do you know why this seat was quarried so flat and angular so that no one would sit comfortably on it
i have not and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes
what is there to remind you of your obligations eragon if the empire falls will you take galbatorix is place and claim his kingship
i do not seek to wear the crown or rule said eragon troubled
being a rider is responsibility enough
no i would not take the throne in uru baen
not unless there was no one else willing or competent enough to take it
hrothgar warned gravely certainly you would be a kinder king than galbatorix but no race should have a leader who does not age or leave the throne
the time of the riders has passed eragon
