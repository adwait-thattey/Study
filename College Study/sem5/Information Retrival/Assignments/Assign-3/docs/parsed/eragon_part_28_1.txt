in the morning eragon and brom retrieved their saddlebags from the stable and prepared to depart
jeod greeted brom while helen watched from the doorway
with grave looks the two men clasped hands
i will miss you old man said jeod
and you i said brom thickly
he bowed his white head and then turned to helen
thank you for your hospitality it was most ** her face reddened
eragon thought she was going to slap him
brom continued unperturbed you have a good husband take care of him
there are few men as brave and as determined as he is
but even he cannot weather difficult times without support from those he ** he bowed again and said gently only a suggestion dear lady
eragon watched as indignation and hurt crossed helen is face
her eyes flashed as she shut the door brusquely
sighing jeod ran his fingers through his hair
eragon thanked him for all his help then mounted cadoc
with the last farewells said he and brom departed
at teirm is south gate the guards let them through without a second glance
as they rode under the giant outer wall eragon saw movement in a shadow
solembum was crouched on the ground tail twitching
the werecat followed them with inscrutable eyes
as the city receded into the distance eragon asked what are werecats
brom looked surprised at the question
why the sudden curiosity
i heard someone mention them in teirm
they re not real are they said eragon pretending ignorance
they are quite real
during the riders years of glory they were as renowned as the dragons
kings and elves kept them as companions yet the werecats were free to do what they chose
very little has ever been known about them
i am afraid that their race has become rather scarce recently
could they use magic asked eragon
no one is sure but they could certainly do unusual things
they always seemed to know what was going on and somehow or another manage to get themselves ** brom pulled his hood up to block a chill wind
what is helgrind asked eragon after a moment is thought
you will see when we get to dras leona
when teirm was out of sight eragon reached out with his mind and called ** the force of his mental shout was so strong that cadoc flicked his ears in annoyance
saphira answered and sped toward them with all of her strength
eragon and brom watched as a dark blur rushed from a cloud then heard a dull roar as saphira is wings flared open
the sun shone behind the thin membranes turning them translucent and silhouetting the dark veins
she landed with a blast of air
eragon tossed cadoc is reins to brom
i will join you for lunch
brom nodded but seemed preoccupied
have a good time he said then looked at saphira and smiled
it is good to see you again
eragon hopped onto saphira is shoulders and held on tightly as she bounded upward
with the wind at her tail saphira sliced through the ** on she warned eragon and letting out a wild bugle she soared in a great loop
eragon yelled with excitement as he flung his arms in the air holding on only with his legs
i did not know i could stay on while you did that without being strapped into the saddle he said grinning fiercely
neither did i admitted saphira laughing in her peculiar way
eragon hugged her tightly and they flew a level path masters of the sky
by noon his legs were sore from riding bareback and his hands and face were numb from the cold air
saphira is scales were always warm to the touch but she could not keep him from getting chilled
when they landed for lunch he buried his hands in his clothes and found a warm sunny place to sit
as he and brom ate eragon asked saphira do you mind if i ride cadoc he had decided to question brom further about his past
no but tell me what he ** was not surprised that saphira knew his plans
it was nearly impossible to hide anything from her when they were mentally linked
when they finished eating she flew away as he joined brom on the trail
after a time eragon slowed cadoc and said i need to talk to you
i wanted to do it when we first arrived in teirm but i decided to wait until now
eragon paused
there is a lot going on that i do not understand
