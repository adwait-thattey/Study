the last sensations he had felt from glaedr still reverberated through his mind he was alone
he was alone and in the dark
** eragon is breath caught as a wave of nausea swept over him
so that is what it is like to lose your rider or your dragon
no wonder galbatorix went insane
we are the last saphira said
the last free dragon and rider she explained
we are the only ones left
we are
eragon stumbled as his foot struck a loose stone he had overlooked
miserable he closed his eyes for a moment
we can not do this by ourselves he thought
we can ** we re not ready
saphira agreed and her grief and anxiety combined with his nearly incapacitated him
when they arrived at the city gates eragon paused reluctant to push his way through the large crowd gathered in front of the opening trying to flee feinster
he glanced around for another route
as his eyes passed over the outer walls a sudden desire gripped him to see the city in the light of day
veering away from saphira he ran up a staircase that led to the top of the walls
saphira uttered a short growl of annoyance and followed half opening her wings as she jumped from the street to the parapet in a single bound
they stood together on the battlements for the better part of an hour and watched as the sun rose
one by one rays of pale gold light streaked across the verdant fields from the east illuminating the countless motes of dust that drifted through the air
where the rays struck a column of smoke the smoke glowed orange and red and billowed with renewed urgency
the fires among the hovels outside the city walls had mostly died out although since eragon and saphira had arrived the fighting had set a score of houses within feinster ablaze and the pillars of flame that leaped up from the disintegrating houses lent the cityscape an eerie beauty
behind feinster the shimmering sea stretched out to the far flat horizon where the sails of a ship plowing its way northward were just visible
as the sun warmed eragon through his armor his melancholy gradually dissipated like the wreaths of mist that adorned the rivers below
he took a deep breath and exhaled relaxing his muscles
no he said we are not alone
i have you and you have me
and there is arya and nasuada and orik and many others besides who will help us along our way
eragon gazed down at the eldunari that lay covered within his arms and felt a rush of sympathy and protectiveness toward the dragon who was trapped inside the heart of hearts
he hugged the stone closer to his chest and laid a hand upon saphira grateful for their companionship
we can do this he thought
galbatorix is not invulnerable
he has a weakness and we can use that weakness against him
we can do this
we can and we must said saphira
for the sake of our friends and our family
and for the rest of alagaesia
eragon lifted glaedr is eldunari over his head presenting it to the sun and the new day and he smiled eager for the battles yet to come so that he and saphira might finally confront galbatorix and kill the dark king
