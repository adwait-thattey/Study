are you sure we would hate to think you had made a mistake
if that were so it would be most
** eragon could imagine only too well what they might do
would anyone but the empire dare threaten people like that probably not but whoever sent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity
yeah i am sure
he had it then
i am not lying
plenty of people know about it
go ask ** sloan sounded shaken
he said something else that eragon did not catch
they have been
rather ** the words were derisive
there was a pause
your information has been helpful
we will not forget ** eragon believed him
sloan muttered something then eragon heard someone hurrying away
he peered around the corner to see what was happening
two tall men stood in the street
both were dressed in long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs
on their shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread
hoods shaded their faces and their hands were covered by gloves
their backs were oddly humped as though their clothes were stuffed with padding
eragon shifted slightly to get a better view
one of the strangers stiffened and grunted peculiarly to his companion
they both swiveled around and sank into crouches
eragon is breath caught
mortal fear clenched him
his eyes locked onto their hidden faces and a stifling power fell over his mind keeping him in place
he struggled against it and screamed to himself ** his legs swayed but to no avail
the strangers stalked toward him with a smooth noiseless gait
he knew they could see his face now
they were almost to the corner hands grasping at swords
** he jerked as his name was called
the strangers froze in place and hissed
brom hurried toward him from the side head bare and staff in hand
the strangers were blocked from the old man is view
eragon tried to warn him but his tongue and arms would not stir
** cried brom again
the strangers gave eragon one last look then slipped away between the houses
eragon collapsed to the ground shivering
sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms sticky
the old man offered eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm
you look sick is all well
eragon gulped and nodded mutely
his eyes flickered around searching for anything unusual
i just got dizzy all of a sudden
it is passed
it was very odd i do not know why it happened
you will recover said brom but perhaps it would be better if you went home
yes i have to get ** have to get there before they ** i think you re right
maybe i am getting ill
then home is the best place for you
it is a long walk but i am sure you will feel better by the time you arrive
let me escort you to the ** eragon did not protest as brom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace
brom is staff crunched in the snow as they passed the houses
why were you looking for me
brom shrugged
simple curiosity
i learned you were in town and wondered if you had remembered the name of that trader
trader what is he talking about eragon stared blankly his confusion caught the attention of brom is probing eyes
no he said and then amended himself i am afraid i still do not remember
brom sighed gruffly as if something had been confirmed and rubbed his eagle nose
well then
if you do come tell me
i am most interested in this trader who pretends to know so much about ** eragon nodded with a distracted air
they walked in silence to the road then brom said hasten home
i do not think it would be a good idea to tarry on the ** he offered a gnarled hand
eragon shook it but as he let go something in brom is hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off
it fell to the ground
the old man picked it up
clumsy of me he apologized and handed it back
as eragon took the mitt brom is strong fingers wrapped around his wrist and twisted sharply
his palm briefly faced upward revealing the silvery mark
brom is eyes glinted but he let eragon yank his hand back and jam it into the mitt
goodbye eragon forced out perturbed and hurried down the road
behind him he heard brom whistling a merry tune
