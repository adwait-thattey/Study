not many people understand what we magic users do
but i wanted you to know that there are others like you and we will help if we can
impulsively eragon put his hand on hers
he had never attempted to approach a woman this way before but instinct urged him onward daring him to take the chance
it was frightening exhilarating
if you want we could go and eat
there is a kitchen not far from here
she slipped her other hand over his fingers smooth and cool so different from the rough grips he was accustomed to
i d like that
shall we trianna stumbled forward as the door burst open behind her
the sorceress whirled around only to yelp as she found herself face to face with saphira
saphira remained motionless except for one lip that slowly lifted to reveal a line of jagged teeth
then she growled
it was a marvelous growl richly layered with scorn and menace that rose and fell through the hall for more than a minute
listening to it was like enduring a blistering hackle raising tirade
eragon glared at her the whole time
when it was over trianna was clenching her dress with both fists twisting the fabric
her face was white and scared
she quickly curtsied to saphira then with a barely controlled motion turned and fled
acting as if nothing had happened saphira lifted a leg and licked a ** was nearly impossible to get the door open she sniffed
eragon could not contain himself any ** did you do that he ** had no reason to interfere
you needed my help she continued unperturbed
if i d needed your help i would have called
do notyell at me she snapped letting her jaws click together
he could sense her emotions boiling with as much turmoil as ** will not have you run around with a slattern who cares more for eragon as rider than you as a person
she was not a slattern roared eragon
he pounded the wall in ** am a man now saphira not a hermit
you can not expect me to ignore
ignore women just because of who i am
and it is certainly not your decision to make
at the very least i might have enjoyed a conversation with her anything other than the tragedies we ve dealt with lately
you re in my head enough to know how i feel
why could not you leave me alone where was the harm
you do not ** refused to meet his eyes

and if you pursue a relationship with or without my blessing and become

you should know that
therefore and i warn you only once be careful who you choose because it will involve both of us
he briefly considered her ** bond works both ways however

i understand your concern
so you were not just jealous
she licked the claw once ** a little
eragon was the one who growled this time
he brushed past her into the room grabbed zar roc then stalked away belting on the sword
he wandered through tronjheim for hours avoiding contact with everyone
what had occurred pained him though he could not deny the truth of saphira is words
of all the matters they shared this was the most delicate and the one they agreed upon least
that night for the first time since he was captured at gil ead he slept away from saphira in one of the dwarves barracks
eragon returned to their quarters the following morning
by unspoken consent he and saphira avoided discussing what had transpired further argument was pointless when neither party was willing to yield ground
besides they were both so relieved to be reunited they did not want to risk endangering their friendship again
they were eating lunch saphira tearing at a bloody haunch when jarsha trotted up
like before he stared wide eyed at saphira following her movements as she nibbled off the end of a leg bone
yes asked eragon wiping his chin and wondering if the council of elders had sent for them
he had heard nothing from them since the funeral
jarsha turned away from saphira long enough to say nasuada would like to see you sir
she is waiting in her father is study
