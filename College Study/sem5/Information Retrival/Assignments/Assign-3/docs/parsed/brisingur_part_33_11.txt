but
if i had to wager argetlam i would wager a cartload of gold that it is az sweldn rak anhuin who is responsible
blast them eragon murmured
whoever it was blast ** he clenched his fists to stop them from shaking
with the side of his boot he nudged one of the prismatic daggers the assassins had wielded
the spells on these weapons and on the
on the men he motioned with his chin men dwarves be as it may they must have required an incredible amount of energy and i cannot even imagine how complex their wording was
casting them would have been hard and dangerous
eragon looked at each of his guards in turn and said as you are my witnesses i swear i shall not let this attack nor kvistor is death go unpunished
whichever clan or clans sent these dung faced killers when i learn their names they will wish they had never thought to strike at me and by striking at me strike at durgrimst ingeitum
this i swear to you as a dragon rider and as a fellow member of durgrimst ingeitum and if any ask you of it repeat my promise to them as i have given it to you
the dwarves bowed before him and he with the forked beard replied as you command so we shall obey argetlam
you honor hrothgar is memory by your words
then another of the dwarves said whichever clan it was they have violated the law of hospitality they have attacked a guest
they are not even so high as rats they are ** he spat on the floor and the other dwarves spat with him
eragon walked to where the remains of his falchion lay
he knelt in the soot and with the tip of a finger touched one of the pieces of metal tracing its ragged edges
i must have hit the shield and the wall so hard i overwhelmed the spells i used to reinforce the steel he thought
then he thought i need a sword
