we have to rescue katrina before he clenched his teeth as the pain surged before they do anything to her
he is right we can not wait said horst looming over them
bind him up as best you can then we will ** elain pursed her lips and hurried to the linen closet
she returned with several rags which she wrapped tightly around roran is torn shoulder and his fractured wrist
meanwhile albriech and baldor scavenged armor and swords from the soldiers
horst contented himself with just a spear
elain put her hands on horst is chest and said be ** she looked at her sons
all of you
we will be fine mother promised albriech
she forced a smile and kissed them on the cheek
they left the house and ran to the edge of carvahall where they found that the wall of trees had been pulled open and the watchman byrd slain
baldor knelt and examined the body then said with a choked voice he was stabbed from ** roran barely heard him through the pounding in his ears
dizzy he leaned against a house and panted for breath
from their stations along carvahall is perimeter the other watchmen congregated around their murdered compatriot forming a huddle of shuttered lanterns
in hushed tones horst described the attack and katrina is plight
who will help us he asked
after a quick discussion five men agreed to accompany them the rest would remain to guard the breach in the wall and rouse the villagers
pushing himself off the house roran trotted to the head of the group as it slipped through the fields and down the valley toward the ra zac is camp
every step was agony yet it did not matter nothing mattered except katrina
he stumbled once and horst wordlessly caught him
half a mile from carvahall ivor spotted a sentry on a hillock which compelled them to make a wide detour
a few hundred yards beyond the ruddy glow of torches became visible
roran raised his good arm to slow their advance then began to dodge and crawl through the tangled grass startling a jackrabbit
the men followed roran is lead as he worked his way to the edge of a grove of cattails where he stopped and parted the curtain of stalks to observe the thirteen remaining soldiers
in contrast to when they had first arrived the soldiers appeared sullen and haggard their weapons nicked and their armor dented
most of them wore bandages that were rusty with splotches of dried blood
the men were clumped together facing the two ra zac both of whom were now hooded across a low fire
one man was shouting
over half of us killed by a bunch of inbred cockle brained woodrats that can not tell a pike from a poleax or find the point of a sword even if it is lodged in their gut becauseyou do not have half the sense my banner boy ** i do not care if galbatorix himself licks your boots clean we wo not do a thing until we have a new ** the men nodded
one who ishuman
we ve had enough taking orders from hunchbacks like you with all your clicking and teapot whistling makes us ** and i do not know what you did with sardson but if you stay another night we will put steel in you and find out if you bleed like us
you can leave the girl though she will be
the man did not get a chance to continue for the largest ra zac jumped across the fire and landed on his shoulders like a giant crow
screaming the soldier collapsed under the weight
he tried to draw his sword but the ra zac pecked twice at his neck with its hidden beak and he was still
we have to fightthat muttered ivor behind roran
the soldiers remained frozen with shock as the two ra zac lapped from the neck of the corpse
when the black creatures rose they rubbed their knobby hands together as if they were washing and said yesss
we will go
stay if you wisssh reinforsssements are only daysss ** the ra zac threw back their heads and began to shriek at the sky the wail becoming increasingly shrill until it passed from hearing
roran looked up as well
at first he saw nothing but then a nameless terror gripped him as two barbed shadows appeared high over the spine eclipsing the stars
they advanced quickly growing larger and larger until they obscured half the sky with their ominous presence
