once again roran wondered what kind of fiendish machinations he and the rest of carvahall had become entangled in
instead of a reward eragon is poster bore two lines of runes
what crime is he accused of roran asked gertrude
the skin around gertrude is eyes wrinkled as she squinted at the board
treason the both of you
it says galbatorix will bestow an earldom on whoever captures eragon but that those who try should take care because he is extremely dangerous
roran blinked with ** it seemed inconceivable until roran considered how he himself had changed in the past few ** same blood runs in our veins
who knows eragon may have accomplished as much or more than i have since he left
in a low voice baldor said if killing galbatorix is men and defying the ra zac only earns you ten thousand crowns large as that is what makes you worth an earldom
buggering the king himself suggested larne
that is enough of that said horst
guard your tongue better baldor or we will end up in irons
and roran do not draw attention to yourself again
with a reward like that people are bound to be watching strangers for anyone who matches your ** running a hand through his hair horst pulled up his belt and said right
we all have jobs to do
return here at noon to report on your progress
with that their party split into three
darmmen larne and hamund set out together to purchase food for the villagers both to meet present needs and to sustain them through the next stage of their journey
gertrude as she had told the guard went to replenish her stock of herbs unguents and tinctures
and roran horst and baldor headed down the sloping streets to the docks where they hoped to charter a ship that could transport the villagers to surda or at the very least teirm
when they reached the weathered boardwalk that covered the beach roran halted and stared out at the ocean which was gray from low clouds and dotted with whitecaps from erratic wind
he had never imagined that the horizon could be so perfectly flat
the hollow boom of water knocking against the piles beneath his feet made it feel as if he stood upon the surface of a huge drum
the odor of fish fresh gutted and rotting overwhelmed every other smell
glancing from roran to baldor who was likewise entranced horst said quite a sight is not it
makes you feel rather small does not it
horst nodded
i remember when i first saw the ocean it had a similar effect on me
when was that asked roran
in addition to the flocks of seagulls whirling over the cove he noticed an odd type of bird perched upon the piers
the animal had an ungainly body with a striped beak that it kept tucked against its breast like a pompous old man a white head and neck and a sooty torso
one of the birds lifted its beak revealing a leathery pouch underneath
bartram the smith who came before me said horst died when i was fifteen a year before the end of my apprenticeship
i had to find a smith who was willing to finish another man is work so i traveled to ceunon which is built along the north sea
there i met kelton a vile old man but good at what he did
he agreed to teach ** horst laughed
by the time we were done i was not sure if i should thank him or curse him
thank him i should think said baldor
you never would have married mother otherwise
roran scowled as he studied the waterfront
there are not many ships he observed
two craft were berthed at the south end of the port and a third at the opposite side with nothing but fishing boats and dinghies in between
of the southern pair one had a broken mast
roran had no experience with ships but to him none of the vessels appeared large enough to carry almost three hundred passengers
going from one ship to the next roran horst and baldor soon discovered that they were all otherwise engaged
it would take a month or more to repair the ship with the broken mast
the vessel beside it thewaverunner was rigged with leather sails and was about to venture north to the treacherous islands where the seithr plant grew
and thealbatross the last ship had just arrived from distant feinster and was getting its seams recaulked before departing with its cargo of wool
