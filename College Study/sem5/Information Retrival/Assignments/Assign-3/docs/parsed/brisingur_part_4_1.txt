the dying remnants of the fire eragon and roran had built cast a dim red light over the surrounding area revealing a patch of rocky soil a few pewter gray bushes the indistinct mass of a juniper tree farther off then nothing
eragon sat with his bare feet extended toward the nest of ruby embers enjoying the warmth and with his back propped against the knobby scales of saphira is thick right foreleg
opposite him roran was perched on the iron hard sun bleached wind worn shell of an ancient tree trunk
every time he moved the trunk produced a bitter shriek that made eragon want to claw at his ears
for the moment quiet reigned within the hollow
even the coals smoldered in silence roran had collected only long dead branches devoid of moisture to eliminate any smoke that unfriendly eyes might spot
eragon had just finished recounting the day is activities to saphira
normally he never had to tell her what he had been doing as thoughts feelings and other sensations flowed between them as easily as water from one side of a lake to another
but in this instance it was necessary because eragon had kept his mind carefully shielded during the scouting expedition aside from his disembodied foray into the ra zac is lair
after a considerable gap in the conversation saphira yawned exposing her rows of many fearsome teeth
cruel and evil they may be but i am impressed that the ra zac can bewitch their prey into wanting to be eaten
they are great hunters to do that
perhaps i shall attempt it someday
but not eragon felt compelled to add with people
try it with sheep instead
people sheep what difference is there to a dragon then she laughed deep in her long throat a rolling rumble that reminded him of thunder
leaning forward to take his weight off saphira is sharp edged scales eragon picked up the hawthorn staff that lay by his side
he rolled it between his palms admiring the play of light over the polished tangle of roots at the top and the much scratched metal ferrule and spike at the base
roran had thrust the staff into his arms before they left the varden on the burning plains saying here
fisk made this for me after the ra zac bit my shoulder
i know you lost your sword and i thought you might have need of it
if you want to get another blade that is fine too but i ve found there are very few fights you can not win with a few whacks from a good strong ** remembering the staff brom had always carried eragon had decided to forgo a new sword in favor of the length of knotted hawthorn
after losing zar roc he felt no desire to take up another lesser sword
that night he had fortified both the knotted hawthorn and the handle to roran is hammer with several spells that would prevent either piece from breaking except under the most extreme stress
unbidden a series of memories overwhelmed eragon a sullen orange and crimson sky swirled around him as saphira dove in pursuit of the red dragon and his rider
wind howled past his ears
his fingers went numb from the jolt of sword striking sword as he dueled that same rider on the ground
tearing off his foe is helm in the midst of combat to reveal his once friend and traveling companion murtagh whom he had thought dead
the sneer upon murtagh is face as he took zar roc from eragon claiming the red sword by right of inheritance as eragon is elder brother
eragon blinked disoriented as the noise and fury of battle faded and the pleasant aroma of juniper wood replaced the stench of blood
he ran his tongue over his upper teeth trying to eradicate the taste of bile that filled his mouth
the name alone generated a welter of confused emotions in eragon
on one hand he liked murtagh
murtagh had saved eragon and saphira from the ra zac after their first ill fated visit to dras leona risked his life to help extricate eragon from gil ead acquitted himself honorably in the battle of farthen dur and despite the torments he no doubt endured as a result had chosen to interpret his orders from galbatorix in a way that allowed him to release eragon and saphira after the battle of the burning plains instead of taking them captive
