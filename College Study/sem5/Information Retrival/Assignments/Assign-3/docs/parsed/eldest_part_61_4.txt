how many of them are there growled orik
it looked a mighty number from saphira is back
aye
we estimate galbatorix mustered as many as a hundred thousand soldiers
eragon could not contain himself a hundred ** where did they come from it seems impossible that he could find more than a handful of people willing to serve him
they were conscripted
we can only hope that the men who were torn from their homes wo not be eager to fight
if we can frighten them badly enough they may break ranks and flee
our numbers are greater than in farthen dur for king orrin has joined forces with us and we have received a veritable flood of volunteers since we began to spread the word about you eragon although we are still far weaker than the empire
then saphira asked and eragon was forced to repeat the dreadful question what do you think our chances of victory are
that said nasuada putting emphasis on the word depends a great deal upon you and eragon and the number of magicians seeded throughout their troops
if you can find and destroy those magicians then our enemies shall be left unprotected and you can slay them at will
outright victory i think is unlikely at this point but we might be able to hold them at bay until their supplies run low or until islanzadi can come to our assistance
that is
if galbatorix does not fly into battle himself
in that case i fear retreat will be our only option
just then eragon felt a strange mind approaching one that knew he was watching and yet did not shrink from the contact
one that felt cold and hard calculating
alert for danger eragon turned his gaze toward the rear of the pavilion where he saw the same black haired girl who had appeared when he scryed nasuada from ellesmera
the girl stared at him with violet eyes then said welcome shadeslayer
welcome saphira
eragon shivered at the sound of her voice the voice of an adult
he wet his dry mouth and asked who are you
without answering the girl brushed back her glossy bangs and exposed a silvery white mark on her forehead exactly like eragon is gedwey ignasia
he knew then whom he faced
no one moved as eragon went to the girl accompanied by saphira who extended her neck farther into the pavilion
dropping to one knee eragon took the girl is right hand in his own her skin burned as if with fever
she did not resist him but merely left her hand limp in his grip
in the ancient language and also with his mind so that she would understand eragon said i am sorry
can you forgive me for what i did to you
the girl is eyes softened and she leaned forward and kissed eragon upon the brow
i forgive you she whispered for the first time sounding her age
how could i not you and saphira created who i am and i know you meant no harm
i forgive you but i shall let this knowledge torture your conscience you have condemned me to be aware of all the suffering around me
even now your spell drives me to rush to the aid of a man not three tents away who just cut his hand to help the young flag carrier who broke his left index finger in the spokes of a wagon wheel and to help countless others who have been or are about to be hurt
it costs me dearly to resist those urges and even more if i consciously cause someone discomfort as i do by saying this
i cannot even sleep at night for the strength of my ** is your legacy o ** by the end her voice had regained its bitter mocking edge
saphira interposed herself between them and with her snout touched the girl in the center of her ** changeling
you have much anger in your heart
you do not have to live like this forever said eragon
the elves taught me how to undo a spell and i believe i can free you of this curse
it wo not be easy but it can be done
for a moment the girl seemed to lose her formidable self control
a small gasp escaped her lips her hand trembled against eragon is and her eyes glistened with a film of tears
then just as quickly she hid her true emotions behind a mask of cynical amusement
well we shall see
either way you should not try until after this battle
i could save you a great deal of pain
