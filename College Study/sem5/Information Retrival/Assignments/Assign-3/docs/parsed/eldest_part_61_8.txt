as a matter of fact i ** it seems that all toads are frogs but not all frogs are toads
so in that sense toads do not really exist which means that i was right all ** she stopped her patter abruptly leaned to the side grabbed a mug from a bench next to her and offered it to eragon
here have a cup of tea
eragon glanced at the deadly plants surrounding them and then back at angela is open face before he accepted the mug
