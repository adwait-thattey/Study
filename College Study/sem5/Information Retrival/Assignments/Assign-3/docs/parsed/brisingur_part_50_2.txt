if a dragon has done this the eldunari will outlast the decay of their flesh and a dragon is essence may live on indefinitely
also a dragon can disgorge their eldunari while they are still alive
by this means a dragon is body and a dragon is consciousness can exist separately and yet still be linked which can be most useful in certain circumstances
but to do this exposes us to great danger for whosoever holds our eldunari holds our very soul in their hands
with it they could force us to do their bidding no matter how vile
the implications of what glaedr had said astounded eragon
shifting his gaze to saphira he asked did you already know about this
the scales on her neck rippled as she made an odd serpentine motion with her head
i have always been aware of my heart of hearts
always i have been able to feel it inside of me but i never thought to mention it to you
how could you not when it is of such significance
would you think it worthy of mention that you have a stomach eragon or a heart or a liver or any other organ my eldunari is an integral part of who i am
i never considered its existence worthy of note
at least not until we last came to ellesmera
only a little
glaedr hinted that my heart of hearts was more important than i had originally believed and he warned me to protect it lest i inadvertently deliver myself into the hands of our enemies
more than that he did not explain but since then i inferred much of what he just said
yet you still did not think this was worth mentioning demanded eragon
i wanted to she growled but as with brom i gave my word to glaedr that i would speak of this to no one not even to you
i trust glaedr and i trust oromis
do you not
eragon scowled and turned back to the elf and the golden dragon
why did not you tell us of this sooner
unstoppering the decanter oromis refilled his goblet with wine and said in order to protect saphira
from you glaedr said
eragon was so surprised and outraged he failed to regain his composure well enough to protest before glaedr resumed speaking
in the wild a dragon would learn about his eldunari from one of his elders when he was old enough to understand the use of it
that way a dragon would not transfer themself into their heart of hearts without knowing the full import of their actions
among the riders a different custom arose
the first few years of partnership between a dragon and a rider are crucial to establishing a healthy relationship between the two and the riders discovered that it was better to wait until newly joined riders and dragons were well familiar with each other before informing them of the eldunari
otherwise in the reckless folly of youth a dragon might decide to disgorge his heart of hearts merely to appease or impress his rider
when we give up our eldunari we are giving up a physical embodiment of our entire being
and we cannot return it to its original place within our bodies once it is gone
a dragon should not undertake the separation of their consciousness lightly for it will change how they live the rest of their lives even if they should endure for another thousand years
do you still have your heart of hearts within you eragon asked
the grass around the table bent under the blast of hot air that erupted from glaedr is nostrils
that is not a meet question to ask any dragon but saphira
do not presume to put it to me again hatchling
although glaedr is rebuke made eragon is cheeks sting he still had the wherewithal to respond as he should with a seated bow and the words no ** then he asked what
what happens if your eldunari breaks
if a dragon has already transferred their consciousness to their heart of hearts then they will die a true death
with an audible click glaedr blinked his inner and outer eyelids flashing across the rayed orb of his iris
before we formed our pact with the elves we kept our hearts in du fells nangoroth the mountains in the center of the hadarac desert
later after the riders established themselves on the island of vroengard and therein built a repository for the eldunari wild dragons and paired dragons both entrusted their hearts to the riders for safekeeping
