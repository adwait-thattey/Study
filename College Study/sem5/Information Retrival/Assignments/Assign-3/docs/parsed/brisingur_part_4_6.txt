eragon reluctantly conceded the point
if my spells fail us we will be far more vulnerable than i expected
tomorrow could end very badly indeed
continuing the strand of conversation he had been privy to roran said this magic is a tricky ** the log he sat on gave a drawn out groan as he rested his elbows on his knees
it is eragon agreed
the hardest part is trying to anticipate every possible spell i spend most of my time asking how can i protect myself if i am attacked like this and would another magician expect me to do that
could you make me as strong and fast as you are
eragon considered the suggestion for several minutes before saying i do not see how
the energy needed to do that would have to come from somewhere
saphira and i could give it to you but then we would lose as much speed or strength as you ** what he did not mention was that one could also extract energy from nearby plants and animals albeit at a terrible price namely the deaths of the smaller beings whose life force you drew upon
the technique was a great secret and eragon felt that he should not reveal it lightly if at all
moreover it would be of no use to roran as too little grew or lived on helgrind to fuel a man is body
then can you teach me to use magic when eragon hesitated roran added not now of course
we do not have the time and i do not expect one can become a magician overnight anyway
but in general why not you and i are cousins
we share much the same blood
and it would be a valuable skill to have
i do not know how someone who is not a rider learns to use magic confessed eragon
it is not something i ** glancing around he plucked a flat round stone from the ground and tossed it to roran who caught it backhand
here try this concentrate on lifting the rock a foot or so into the air and say stenr **
roran frowned at the stone resting on his palm in a pose so reminiscent of eragon is own training that eragon could not help feeling a flash of nostalgia for the days he spent being drilled by brom
roran is eyebrows met his lips tightened into a snarl and he growled stenr ** with enough intensity eragon half expected the stone to fly out of sight
scowling even harder roran repeated his command stenr **
the stone exhibited a profound lack of movement
well said eragon keep trying
that is the only advice i can give you
but and here he raised a finger if you should happen to succeed make sure you immediately come to me or if i am not around another magician
you could kill yourself and others if you start experimenting with magic without understanding the rules
if nothing else remember this if you cast a spell that requires too much energy you will die
do not take on projects that are beyond your abilities do not try to bring back the dead and do not try to unmake anything
roran nodded still looking at the stone
magic aside i just realized there is something far more important that you need to learn
yes you need to be able to hide your thoughts from the black hand du vrangr gata and others like them
you know a lot of things now that could harm the varden
it is crucial then that you master this skill as soon as we return
until you can defend yourself from spies neither nasuada nor i nor anyone else can trust you with information that might help our enemies
i understand
but why did you include du vrangr gata in that list they serve you and nasuada
they do but even among our allies there are more than a few people who would give their right arm he grimaced at the appropriateness of the phrase to ferret out our plans and secrets
and yours too no less
you have become a somebody roran
partly because of your deeds and partly because we are related
i know
it is strange to be recognized by those you have not met
that it ** several other related observations leaped to the tip of eragon is tongue but he resisted the urge to pursue the topic it was a subject to explore another time
now that you know what it feels like when one mind touches another you might be able to learn to reach out and touch other minds in turn
i am not sure that is an ability i want to have
