a thin gray light pervaded the tent leaching objects of their color rendering everything a pale shadow of its daylight self
he shivered
the blankets had slid down to his waist exposing his torso to the cold night air
as he pulled them back up he noticed that katrina was no longer by his side
he saw her sitting by the entrance to the tent staring up at the sky
she had a cloak wrapped over her shift
her hair fell to the small of her back a dark tangled bramble
a lump formed in roran is throat as he studied her
dragging the blankets with him he sat beside her
he placed an arm around her shoulders and she leaned against him her head and neck warm against his chest
he kissed her on the brow
for a long while he contemplated the glimmering stars with her and listened to the regular pattern of her breathing the only sound besides his own in the sleeping world
then she whispered the constellations are shaped differently here
have you noticed
** he shifted his arm fitting it against the curve of her waist and feeling the slight bulge of her growing belly
what woke you
starlight gleamed in her eyes as she twisted in his arms and gazed at him
i was thinking about you and us
and our future together
those are heavy thoughts for so late at night
now that we are married how do you plan to care for me and for our child
is that what worries you he smiled
you wo not starve we have gold enough to assure that
besides the varden will always see to it that eragon is cousins have food and shelter
even if something were to happen to me they would continue to provide for you and the baby
yes but what do you intend to do
puzzled he searched her face for the source of her agitation
i am going to help eragon end this war so we can return to palancar valley and settle down without fear of soldiers dragging us off to uru baen
what else would i do
you will fight with the varden then
as you would have fought today if nasuada had let you
what of our baby though an army on the march is no place to raise a child
we cannot run away and hide from the empire katrina
unless the varden win galbatorix will find and kill us or he will find and kill our children or our children is children
and i do not think the varden will achieve victory unless everyone does their utmost to help them
she placed a finger over his lips
you are my only love
no other man shall ever capture my heart
i will do everything i can to lighten your burden
i will cook your meals mend your clothes and clean your armor
but once i give birth i will leave this army
** he went rigid
that is ** where would you go
dauth perhaps
remember lady alarice offered us sanctuary and some of our people are still there
i would not be alone
if you think i am going to let you and our newborn child go tramping across alagaesia by yourselves then
yes you ** clasping his hand between hers and pressing it against her heart she said it is not safe here
if it were only the two of us i could accept the danger but not when it is our baby who might die
i love you roran i love you so much but our child has to come before anything we want for ourselves
otherwise we do not deserve to be called ** tears shone in her eyes and he felt his own eyes dampen
it was you after all who convinced me to leave carvahall and hide in the spine when the soldiers attacked
this is no different
the stars swam before roran as his vision blurred
i would rather lose an arm than be parted from you again
katrina began to cry then her quiet sobs shaking his body
i do not want to leave you either
he tightened his embrace and rocked back and forth with her
when her weeping subsided he whispered in her ear i would rather lose an arm than be parted from you but i would rather die than allow anyone to hurt you
or our child
if you are going to leave you should leave now while it is still easy for you to travel
she shook her head
no
i want gertrude as my midwife
she is the only one i trust
besides if i have any difficulty i would rather be here where there are magicians trained in healing
nothing will go wrong he said
as soon as our child is born you will go to aberon not dauth it is less likely to be attacked
