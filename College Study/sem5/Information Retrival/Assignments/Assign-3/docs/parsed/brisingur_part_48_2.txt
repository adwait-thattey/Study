i am rather proud of what he achieved on his own and without the aid of his dragon
it is always heartening for a teacher to see one of his students excel however it might be
but i digress
it so happened then that some twenty years ago the varden began to receive reports from their spies within the empire about the activities of a mysterious woman known only as the black hand
your mother and murtagh is said oromis
at first the varden knew nothing about her save that she was extremely dangerous and that she was loyal to the empire
in time and after a great deal of bloodshed it became apparent that she served morzan and morzan alone and that he had come to depend upon her to carry out his will throughout the empire
upon learning of this brom set out to kill the black hand and so to strike at morzan
since the varden could not predict where your mother might appear next brom traveled to morzan is castle and spied upon it until he was able to devise a means of infiltrating the hold
is not was the castle still stands
galbatorix uses it for himself now
it is situated among the foothills of the spine near the northwestern shore of leona lake hidden well away from the rest of the land
eragon said jeod told me that brom snuck into the castle by pretending to be one of the servants
he did and it was no easy task
morzan had impregnated his fortress with hundreds of spells designed to protect him from his enemies
he also forced everyone who served him to swear oaths of fealty and often with their true names
however after much experimentation brom managed to find a flaw in morzan is wards that allowed him to procure a position as a gardener on his estate and it was in that guise he first met your mother
glancing down at his hands eragon said and then he seduced her to hurt morzan i suppose
not at all replied oromis
that may have been his intention to begin with but then something happened neither he nor your mother anticipated they fell in love
whatever affection your mother once had for morzan had vanished by then expunged by his cruel treatment of her and their newborn child murtagh
i do not know the exact sequence of events but at some point brom revealed his true identity to your mother
instead of betraying him she began to supply the varden with information about galbatorix morzan and the rest of the empire
but said eragon did not morzan have her swear oaths of fealty to him in the ancient language how could she turn against him
a smile appeared on oromis is thin lips
she could because morzan allowed her somewhat more freedom than his other servants so that she could use her own ingenuity and initiative while carrying out his orders
in his arrogance morzan believed that her love for him would ensure her loyalty better than any oath
also she was not the same woman who had bound herself to morzan becoming a mother and meeting brom altered her character to such a degree that her true name changed which released her from her previous commitments
if morzan had been more careful if for example he had cast a spell that would alert him if ever she failed to abide by her promises he would have known the moment he lost control over her
but that was always a shortcoming of morzan is he would devise a cunning spell but then it would fail because in his impatience he overlooked some crucial detail
eragon frowned
why did not my mother leave morzan once she had the chance
after all she had done in morzan is name she felt it was her duty to help the varden
but more importantly she could not bring herself to abandon murtagh to his father
could not she have taken him with her
if it had been within her power i am sure she would have
morzan realized that the child gave him a vast amount of control over your mother
he forced her to surrender murtagh to a wet nurse and only allowed her to visit him at infrequent intervals
what morzan did not know is that during those intervals she also visited brom
oromis turned to watch a pair of swallows cavorting in the blue sky
in profile his delicate slanted features reminded eragon of a hawk or a sleek cat
