the name the name say it again
holding the sword as far away from his body as he could eragon exclaimed **
a column of flickering flames engulfed the blade of the sword the heat warming eragon is face
this time eragon noticed the slight drain on his strength from the spell
after a few moments he extinguished the smokeless fire
once more eragon exclaimed ** and once more the blade shimmered with blue wraithlike tongues of flame
now there is a fitting sword for a rider and ** said saphira in a delighted tone
it breathes fire as easily as i do
but i was not trying to cast a ** protested eragon
all i did was say brisingr and he yelped and swore as the sword again caught fire which he put out for the fourth time
may i asked rhunon extending a hand toward eragon
he gave her the sword and she too said ** a shiver seemed to run down the blade but other than that it remained inanimate
her expression contemplative rhunon returned the sword to eragon and said i can think of two explanations for this marvel
one is that because you were involved with the forging you imbued the blade with a portion of your personality and therefore it has become attuned to your wishes
my other explanation is that you have discovered the true name of your sword
perhaps both those things are what has happened
in any event you have chosen well shadeslayer
** yes i like it
it is a good name for a sword
a very good name saphira agreed
then rhunon placed her hand over the middle of brisingr is blade and murmured an inaudible spell
the elvish glyph for fire appeared upon both sides of the blade
she did the same to the front of the scabbard
again eragon bowed to the elf woman and both he and saphira expressed their gratitude to her
a smile appeared on rhunon is aged face and she touched each of them upon their brows with her callused thumb
i am glad i was able to help the riders this once more
go shadeslayer
go brightscales
return to the varden and may your enemies flee with fear when they see the sword you now wield
so eragon and saphira bade her farewell and together they departed rhunon is house eragon cradling brisingr in his arms as he would a newborn child
