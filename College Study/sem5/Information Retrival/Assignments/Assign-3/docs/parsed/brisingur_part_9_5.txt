i have no need for your tintainted gold
no nothing but the trial of the long knives can compensate me for the slander nasuada has aimed at my people and me
orrin clenched tight the folds of his robes but he bowed and said aye i will bear witness
from within their voluminous sleeves fadawar is four warriors produced small hairy goat hide drums
squatting they placed the drums between their knees and struck up a furious beat pounding so fast their hands were sooty smudges in the air
the rough music obliterated all other sound as well as the host of frantic thoughts that had been bedeviling nasuada
her heart felt as if it were keeping pace with the manic tempo that assaulted her ears
without missing a single note the oldest of fadawar is men reached inside his vest and from there drew two long curved knives that he tossed toward the peak of the tent
nasuada watched the knives tumble haft over blade fascinated by the beauty of their motion
when it was close enough she lifted her arm and caught her knife
the opal studded hilt stung her palm
fadawar successfully intercepted his weapon as well
he then grasped the left cuff of his garment and pushed the sleeve past his elbow
nasuada kept her eyes fixed upon fadawar is forearm as he did
his limb was thick and muscled but she deemed that of no importance athletic gifts would not help him win their contest
what she looked for instead were the telltale ridges that if they existed would lie across the belly of his forearm
** she thought
so many
her confidence wavered as she contemplated the evidence of fadawar is fortitude
the only thing that kept her from losing her nerve altogether was elva is prediction the girl had said that in this nasuada would prevail
nasuada clung to the memory as if it were her only child
she said i can do this so i must be able to outlast fadawar
i must be able to
as he was the one who had issued the challenge fadawar went first
he held his left arm straight out from his shoulder palmupward placed the blade of his knife against his forearm just below the crease of his elbow and drew the mirror polished edge across his flesh
his skin split like an overripe berry blood welling from within the crimson crevice
she smiled and set her own knife against her arm
the metal was as cold as ice
theirs was a test of wills to discover who could withstand the most cuts
the belief was that whoever aspired to become the chief of a tribe or even a warlord should be willing to endure more pain than anyone else for the sake of his or her people
otherwise how could the tribes trust their leaders to place the concerns of the community before their own selfish desires it was nasuada is opinion that the practice encouraged extremism but she also understood the ability of the gesture to earn people is trust
although the trial of the long knives was specific to the dark skinned tribes besting fadawar would solidify her standing among the varden and she hoped king orrin is followers
she offered a quick plea for strength to gokukara the praying mantis goddess and then pulled on the knife
the sharpened steel slid through her skin so easily she struggled to avoid cutting too deeply
she shuddered at the sensation
she wanted to fling the knife away and clutch her wound and scream
she did none of those things
she kept her muscles slack if she tensed the process would hurt all the more
and she kept smiling as slowly the blade mutilated her body
the cut ended after only three seconds but in those seconds her outraged flesh delivered a thousand shrieking complaints and each one nearly made her stop
as she lowered the knife she noticed that while the tribesmen still beat upon their drums she heard naught but the pounding of her pulse
then fadawar slashed himself a second time
the cords in his neck stood in high relief and his jugular vein bulged as if it would burst while the knife carved its bloody path
nasuada saw it was her turn again
knowing what to expect only increased her fear
her instinct for self preservation an instinct that had served her well on all other occasions warred against the commands she sent to her arm and hand
