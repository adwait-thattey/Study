so she too grew up without knowing her ** shook off the thought
i am restless
it will be good to use my muscles
where should i go for this testing of ajihad is
orik pointed out into farthen dur
the training field is half a mile from tronjheim though you can not see it from here because it is behind the city mountain
it is a large area where both dwarves and humans practice
eragon told orik and the dwarf tugged on his beard
that might not be a good idea
there are many people at the training field you will be sure to attract attention
saphira growled ** will ** and that settled the matter
the unruly clatter of fighting reached them from the field the loud clang of steel clashing on steel the solid thump of arrows striking padded targets the rattle and crack of wooden staves and the shouts of men in mock battle
the noise was confusing yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern
the bulk of the training ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling with shields and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves
they drilled as a group in formations
practicing beside them were hundreds of individual warriors outfitted with swords maces spears staves flails shields of all shapes and sizes and even eragon saw someone with a pitchfork
nearly all the fighters wore armor usually chain mail and a helmet plate armor was not as common
there were as many dwarves as humans though the two kept mainly to themselves
behind the sparring warriors a broad line of archers fired steadily at gray sackcloth dummies
before eragon had time to wonder what he was supposed to do a bearded man his head and blocky shoulders covered by a mail coif strode over to them
the rest of him was protected by a rough oxhide suit that still had hair on it
a huge sword almost as long as eragon hung across his broad back
he ran a quick eye over saphira and eragon as if evaluating how dangerous they were then said gruffly knurla orik
you ve been gone too long
there is nobody left for me to spar with
orik smiled
oei that is because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster sword
that is because i am faster than a giant like you
the man looked at eragon again
i am fredric
i ve been told to find out what you can do
how strong are you
strong enough answered eragon
i have to be in order to fight with magic
fredric shook his head the coif clinked like a bag of coins
magic has no place in what we do here
unless you ve served in an army i doubt any fights you ve been in lasted more than a few minutes
what we re concerned about is how you will be able to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours or even weeks if it is a siege
do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow
eragon thought about it
only my fists
good ** laughed fredric
well we will start you off with the bow and see how you do
then once some space has cleared up on the field we will try he broke off suddenly and stared past eragon scowling angrily
the twins stalked toward them their bald heads pale against their purple robes
orik muttered something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his belt
i told you two to stay away from the training area said fredric stepping forward threateningly
the twins seemed frail before his bulk
they looked at him arrogantly
we were ordered by ajihad to test eragon is proficiency with magic beforeyou exhaust him banging on pieces of metal
fredric glowered
why can not someone else test him
no one else is powerful enough sniffed the twins
saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them
a line of smoke trickled from her nostrils but they ignored her
come with us they ordered and strode to an empty corner of the field
shrugging eragon followed with saphira
behind him he heard fredric say to orik we have to stop them from going too far
i know answered orik in a low voice but i can not interfere again
hrothgar made it clear he wo not be able to protect me the next time it happens
eragon forced back his growing apprehension
the twins might know more techniques and words
still he remembered what brom had told him riders were stronger in magic than ordinary men
