they are to be bunked with the others of their kind and by
but only if the two factions refrain from fighting
command will be given under tarok under gashz under durza under ushnark the mighty
ushnark is galbatorix
it means father in the urgal tongue an affectation that pleases him
find what they are suitable for and
the footmen and
are to be kept separate
no weapons are to be distributed until
for marching
nothing else can be read past there except for a few vague words said ajihad
where is ithro zhada i ve never heard of it
nor have i confirmed ajihad which makes me suspect that galbatorix has renamed an existing place for his own purposes
after deciphering this i asked myself what hundreds of urgals were doing by the beor mountains where you first saw them and where they were going
the parchment mentions others of their kind so i assume there are even more urgals at their destination
there is only one reason for the king to gather such a force to forge a bastard army of humans and monsters to destroy us
for now there is nothing to do but wait and watch
without further information we cannot find this ithro zhada
still farthen dur has not yet been discovered so there is hope
the only urgals to have seen it died last night
how did you know we were coming asked eragon
one of the twins was waiting for us and there was an ambush in place for the ** he was aware of saphira listening intently
though she kept her own counsel he knew she would have things to say later
we have sentinels placed at the entrance of the valley you traveled through on either side of the beartooth river
they sent a dove to warn us explained ajihad
eragon wondered if it was the same bird saphira had tried to eat
when the egg and arya disappeared did you tell brom he said that he had not heard anything from the varden
we tried to alert him said ajihad but i suspect our men were intercepted and killed by the empire
why else would the ra zac have gone to carvahall after that brom was traveling with you and it was impossible to get word to him
i was relieved when he contacted me via messenger from teirm
it did not surprise me that he went to jeod they were old friends
and jeod could easily send us a message because he smuggles supplies to us through surda
all of this has raised serious questions
how did the empire know where to ambush arya and later our messengers to carvahall how has galbatorix learned which merchants help the varden jeod is business has been virtually destroyed since you left him as have those of other merchants who support us
every time one of their ships sets sail it disappears
the dwarves cannot give us everything we need so the varden are in desperate need of supplies
i am afraid that we have a traitor or traitors in our midst despite our efforts to examine people is minds for deceit
eragon sank deep in thought pondering what he had learned
ajihad waited calmly for him to speak undisturbed by the silence
for the first time since finding saphira is egg eragon felt that he understood what was going on around him
at last he knew where saphira came from and what might lie in his future
what do you want from me he asked
i mean what is expected of me in tronjheim you and the elves have plans for me but what if i do not like them a hard note crept into his voice
i will fight when needed revel when there is occasion mourn when there is grief and die if my time comes
but i wo not let anyone use me against my ** he paused to let the words sink in
the riders of old were arbiters of justice above and beyond the leaders of their time
i do not claim that position i doubt people would accept such oversight when they ve been free of it all their lives especially from one as young as me
but ido have power and i will wield it as i see fit
what i want to know is howyou plan to use me
then i will decide whether to agree to it
ajihad looked at him wryly
if you were anyone else and were before another leader you would likely have been killed for that insolent speech
what makes you think i will expose my plans just because you demand it eragon flushed but did not lower his gaze
