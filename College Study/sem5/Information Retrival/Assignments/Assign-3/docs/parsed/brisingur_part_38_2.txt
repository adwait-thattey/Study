all three groups were pressed against one another among the beech trees which roran thought was a mistake the time it took to organize themselves once they broke from cover would be extra time the soldiers would have to marshal their defenses
leaning over toward carn roran said i do not see any of them with missing hands or legs or other injuries of note but that proves nothing one way or another
can you tell if any of them are men who cannot feel pain
carn sighed
i wish i could
your cousin might be able to for murtagh and galbatorix are the only spellcasters eragon need fear but i am a poor magician and i dare not test the soldiers
if there are any magicians disguised among the soldiers they would know of my spying and there is every chance i would not be able to break their minds before they alerted their companions we are here
we seem to have this discussion every time we are about to fight roran observed studying the soldiers armaments and trying to decide how best to deploy his men
with a laugh carn said that is all right
i only hope we keep having it because if not
one or both of us will be dead
or nasuada will have reassigned us to different captains
and then we might as well be dead because no one else will guard our backs as well roran concluded
a smile touched his lips
it had become an old joke between them
he drew his hammer from his belt and then winced as his right leg twinged where the ox had ripped his flesh with its horn
scowling he reached down and massaged the location of the wound
carn saw and asked are you well
it wo not kill me said roran then reconsidered his words
well maybe it will but i will be blasted if i am going to wait here while you go off and cut those bumbling oafs to pieces
when the soldiers reached the village they marched straight through it pausing only to break down the door to each house and tramp through the rooms to see if anyone was hiding inside
a dog ran out from behind a rain barrel his ruff standing on end and began barking at the soldiers
one of the men stepped forward and threw his spear at the dog killing it
as the first of the soldiers reached the far side of the village roran tightened his hand around the haft of his hammer in preparation for the charge but then he heard a series of high pitched screams and a sense of dread gripped him
a squad of soldiers emerged from the second to last house dragging three struggling people a lanky white haired man a young woman with a torn blouse and a boy no older than eleven
sweat sprang up on roran is brow
in a low slow monotone he began to swear cursing the three captives for not having fled with their neighbors cursing the soldiers for what they had done and might yet do cursing galbatorix and cursing whatever whim of fate had resulted in the situation as it was
behind him he was aware of his men shifting and muttering with anger eager to punish the soldiers for their brutality
having searched all of the houses the mass of soldiers retraced their steps to the center of the village and formed a rough semicircle around their prisoners
** crowed roran to himself as the soldiers turned their backs to the varden
edric is plan had been to wait for them to do just that
in anticipation of the order to charge roran rose up several inches above his saddle his entire body tense
he tried to swallow but his throat was too dry
the officer in charge of the soldiers who was the only man among them on a horse dismounted his steed and exchanged a few inaudible words with the white haired villager
without warning the officer drew his saber and decapitated the man then hopped backward to avoid the resulting spray of blood
the young woman screamed even louder than before
it took roran a half second to comprehend that the word edric had uttered so calmly was the command he had been waiting for
** shouted sand on the other side of edric and galloped out of the copse of beech trees along with his men
** shouted roran and dug his heels into snowfire is sides
he ducked behind his shield as snowfire carried him through the net of branches then lowered it again when they were in the open flying down the side of the hill with the thunder of hoofbeats surrounding them
