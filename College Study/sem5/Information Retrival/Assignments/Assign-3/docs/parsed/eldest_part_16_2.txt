and there are children who should be sent to safety maybe to cawley is farm on nost creek
you should go as well elain
i wo not leave horst said elain calmly
tara bristled
this is no place for a woman five months pregnant
you will lose the child running around like you have
it would do me far more harm to worry in ignorance than remain here
i have borne my sons i will stay as i know you and every other wife in carvahall will
horst came around the table and with a tender expression took elain is hand
nor would i have you anywhere but at my side
the children should go though
cawley will care for them well but we must make sure that the route to his farm is clear
not only that rasped loring none of us not one blasted man jack can have a thing to do with the families down the valley iside from cawley of course
they can not help us and we do not want thosedesecrators to trouble em
everyone agreed that he was right then the meeting ended and the attendees dispersed throughout carvahall
before long however they recongregated along with most of the village in the small cemetery behind gertrude is house
ten white swathed corpses were arranged beside their graves a sprig of hemlock on each of their cold chests and a silver amulet around each of their necks
gertrude stood forth and recited the men is names parr wyglif ged bardrick farold hale garner kelby melkolf and ** she placed black pebbles over their eyes then raised her arms lifted her face to the sky and began the quavering death lay
tears seeped from the corners of her closed eyes as her voice rose and fell with the immemorial phrases sighing and moaning with the village is sorrow
she sang of the earth and the night and of humanity is ageless sorrow from which none escape
after the last mournful note faded into silence family members praised the feats and traits of those they had lost
then the bodies were buried
as roran listened his gaze lit upon the anonymous mound where the three soldiers had been ** killed by nolfavrell and two by me
he could still feel the visceral shock of muscle and bone giving
crunching
pulping under his hammer
his bile rose and he had to struggle not to be sick in full view of the ** am the one who destroyed them
roran had never expected or wanted to kill and yet he had taken more lives than anyone else in carvahall
it felt as if his brow was marked with blood
he left as soon as possible not even stopping to speak with katrina and climbed to a point where he could survey carvahall and consider how best to protect it
unfortunately the houses were too far apart to form a defensive perimeter by just fortifying the spaces between buildings
nor did roran think it would be a good idea to have soldiers fighting up against the walls of people is houses and trampling their ** anora river guards our western flank he thought but as for the rest of carvahall we could not even keep a child out of it
what can we build in a few hours that will be a strong enough barrier
he jogged into the middle of the village and shouted i need everyone who is free to help cut down ** after a minute men began to trickle out of the houses and through the streets
come on ** we all have to ** roran waited as the group around him continued to grow
one of loring is sons darmmen shouldered to his side
what is your plan
roran raised his voice so they could all hear
we need a wall around carvahall the thicker the better
i figure if we get some big trees lay them on their sides and sharpen the branches the ra zac will have a pretty hard time getting over them
how many trees do you think it will take asked orval
roran hesitated trying to gauge carvahall is circumference
at least fifty
maybe sixty to do it ** the men swore and began to argue
** roran counted the number of people in the crowd
he arrived at forty eight
if you each fell a tree in the next hour we will be almost done
can you do that
what do you take us for retorted orval
the last time i took an hour on a tree i was **
darmmen spoke up what about brambles we could drape them over the trees
