on the first day from tarnag eragon made an effort to learn the names of undin is guards
they were ama trihga hedin ekksvar shrrgnien which eragon found unpronounceable though he was told it meant wolfheart duthmer and thorv
each raft had a small cabin in the center
eragon preferred to spend his time seated on the edge of the logs watching the beor mountains scroll by
kingfishers and jackdaws flitted along the clear river while blue herons stood stiltlike on the marshy bank which was planked with splotches of light that fell through the boughs of hazel beech and willow
occasionally a bullfrog would croak from a bed of ferns
when orik settled beside him eragon said it is beautiful
that it ** the dwarf quietly lit his pipe then leaned back and puffed
eragon listened to the creak of wood and rope as trihga steered the raft with the long paddle at the aft
orik can you tell me why brom joined the varden i know so little about him
for most of my life he was just the town storyteller
he neverjoined the varden he helped found ** orik paused to tap some ashes into the water
after galbatorix became king brom was the only rider still alive outside of the forsworn
but he was not a rider not then
his dragon was killed in the fighting at doru araeba
well a rider by training
brom was the first to organize the friends and allies of the riders who had been forced into exile
it was he who convinced hrothgar to allow the varden to live in farthen dur and he who obtained the elves assistance
they were silent for a while
why did brom relinquish the leadership asked eragon
orik smiled wryly
perhaps he never wanted it
it was before hrothgar adopted me so i saw little of brom in tronjheim
he was always off fighting the forsworn or engaged in one plot or another
aye
the pox took them when i was young and hrothgar was kind enough to welcome me into his hall and since he has no children of his own to make me his heir
eragon thought of his helm marked with the ingeitum ** has been kind to me as well
when the afternoon twilight arrived the dwarves hung a round lantern at each corner of the rafts
the lanterns were red which eragon remembered was to preserve night vision
he stood by arya and studied the lanterns pure motionless depths
do you know how these are made he asked
it was a spell we gave the dwarves long ago
they use it with great skill
eragon reached up and scratched his chin and cheeks feeling the patches of stubble that had begun to appear
could you teach me more magic while we travel
she looked at him her balance perfect on the undulating logs
it is not my place
a teacher is waiting for you
then tell me this at least he said
what does the name of my sword mean
arya is voice was very soft
miseryis your sword
and so it was until you wielded it
eragon stared with aversion at zar roc
the more he learned about his weapon the more malevolent it seemed as if the blade could cause misfortune of its own free ** only did morzan kill riders with it but zar roc is very name is evil
if brom had not given it to him and if not for the fact that zar roc never dulled and could not be broken eragon would have thrown it into the river at that very moment
before it grew any darker eragon swam out to saphira
they flew together for the first time since leaving tronjheim and soared high above the az ragni where the air was thin and the water below was only a purple streak
without the saddle eragon gripped saphira tightly with his knees feeling her hard scales rub the scars from their first flight
as saphira tilted to the left rising on an updraft he saw three brown specks launch themselves from the mountainside below and ascend rapidly
at first eragon took them to be falcons but as they neared he realized that the animals were almost twenty feet long with attenuated tails and leathery wings
in fact they looked like dragons though their bodies were smaller thinner and more serpentine than saphira is
nor did their scales glitter but were dappled green and brown
excited eragon pointed them out to ** they be dragons he asked
