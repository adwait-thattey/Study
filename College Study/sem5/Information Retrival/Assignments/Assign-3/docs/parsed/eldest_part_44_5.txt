what if i may make so bold as to inquire do you wish to transport
be it sheep cattle horses goats oxen
our herds contain an assortment of animals
and why do you want to take them to teirm
we have our ** roran almost smiled at clovis is confusion
would you consider sailing past teirm
** teirm is my limit it is
i do not know the waters beyond nor would i want to be gone any longer from my wife and daughter
clovis hesitated and executed two little steps
mayhap five or six days
no
no you d better make it a week i have affairs that i must attend to before departing
we d pay an additional ten crowns to leave day after tomorrow
day after tomorrow it is vowed clovis
one way or another i will be ready by then
trailing his hand along the barge is gunwale roran nodded without looking back at clovis and said may i have a minute alone to confer with my associates
as you wish sir
i will just go for a turn about the docks until you re ** clovis hurried to the door
just as he exited the shed he asked i am sorry but what d be your name again i fear i missed it earlier an my memory can be something dreadful
ah of course
a good name that
when the door closed horst and baldor converged on roran
baldor said we can not afford to hire him
we can not affordnot to replied roran
we do not have the gold to buy the barges nor do i fancy teaching myself to handle them when everyone is lives depend on it
it will be faster and safer to pay for a crew
it is still too expensive said horst
roran drummed his fingers against the gunwale
we can pay clovis is initial fee of two hundred crowns
once we reach teirm though i suggest that we either steal the barges using the skills we learn during the trip or incapacitate clovis and his men until we can escape through other means
that way we avoid paying the extra four hundred crowns as well as the sailors wages
i do not like cheating a man out of honest work said horst
it goes against my fiber
i do not like it either but can you think of an alternative
how would you get everyone onto the barges
have them meet clovis a league or so down the coast out of sight of narda
horst sighed
very well we will do it but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth
call clovis back in baldor and we will seal this pact
that evening the villagers gathered around a small banked fire in order to hear what had transpired in narda
from where he knelt on the ground roran stared at the pulsing coals while he listened to gertrude and the three brothers describe their separate adventures
the news about roran is and eragon is posters caused murmurs of unease among the audience
when darmmen finished horst took his place and with short brisk sentences related the lack of proper ships in narda how the dockworker recommended clovis and the deal that was brokered thereafter
however the moment horst mentioned the wordbarges the villagers cries of ire and discontent blotted out his voice
marching to the forefront of the group loring raised his arms for attention
barges said the cobbler
barges we do not want nostinking ** he spat by his foot as people clamored with agreement
everyone be ** said delwin
we will be heard if we keep this ** when the crackling fire was the loudest noise he continued at a slower pace i agree with loring
barges are unacceptable
they re slow and vulnerable
and we d be crammed together with a complete lack of privacy and no shelter to speak of for who knows how long
horst elain is six months pregnant
you can not expect her and others who are sick and infirm to sit under the blazing sun for weeks on end
we can lash tarpaulins over the holds replied horst
it is not much but it will shield us from the sun and the rain
birgit is voice cut through the crowd is low babble i have another ** people moved aside as she walked to the fire
what with the two hundred crowns clovis is due and the money darmmen and his brothers spent we ve used up most of our coin
unlike those in cities our wealth lies not in gold but in animals and property
our property is gone and few animals are left
even if we turn pirate and steal these barges how can we buy supplies at teirm or passage farther south
