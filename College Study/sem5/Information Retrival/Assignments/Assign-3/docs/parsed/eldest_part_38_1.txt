ma am
you re needed ma am
what reluctant to move nasuada opened her eyes and saw jormundur enter the room
the wiry veteran pulled off his helm tucked it in the crook of his right arm and made his way to her with his left hand planted on the pommel of his sword
the links of his hauberk clinked as he bowed
my lady
welcome jormundur
how is your son today she was pleased that he had come
of all the members of the council of elders he had accepted her leadership the most easily serving her with the same dogged loyalty and determination as he had ** all my warriors were like him no one could stop us
i am glad to hear it
now what brings you
lines appeared on jormundur is forehead
he ran his free hand over his hair which was tied back in a ponytail then caught himself and pushed his hand back down to his side
magic of the strangest kind
do you remember the babe that eragon blessed
** nasuada had seen her only once but she was well aware of the exaggerated tales about the child that circulated among the varden as well as the varden is hopes for what the girl might achieve once she grew up
nasuada was more pragmatic about the subject
whatever the infant became it would not be for many years by which time the battle with galbatorix would already be won or lost
i ve been asked to take you to her
a boy on the practice field told me that you should visit the child
said that you would find it interesting
he refused to give me his name but he looked like what that witch is werecat is supposed to turn into so i thought
well i thought you should ** jormundur looked embarrassed
i asked my men questions about the girl and i heard things
that she isdifferent
he shrugged
enough to believe that you should do what the werecat says
nasuada frowned
she knew from the old stories that ignoring a werecat was the height of folly and often led to one is doom
however his companion angela the herbalist was another magic user that nasuada did not entirely trust she was too independent and unpredictable
magic she said making it a curse
magic agreed jormundur though he used it as a word of awe and fear
very well let us go visit this child
is she within the castle
orrin gave her and her caretaker rooms on the west side of the keep
gathering up her skirts nasuada ordered farica to postpone the rest of the day is appointments then left the chambers
behind her she heard jormundur snap his fingers as he directed four guards to take up positions around her
a moment later he joined her side pointing out their course
the heat within borromeo castle had increased to the point where they felt as if they were trapped within a giant bread oven
the air shimmered like liquid glass along the windowsills
though she was uncomfortable nasuada knew that she dealt with the heat better than most people because of her swarthy skin
the ones who had the hardest time enduring the high temperatures were men like jormundur and her guards who had to wear their armor all day long even if they were stationed out under the lidless gaze of the sun
nasuada kept close watch on the five men as sweat gathered on their exposed skin and their breathing became ever more ragged
since they had arrived in aberon a number of the varden had fainted from heatstroke two of whom died an hour or two later and she had no intention of losing more of her subjects by driving them beyond their physical limits
when she deemed they needed to rest she bade them to stop overriding their objections and get drinks of water from a servant
i can not have you toppling like ninepins
they had to break twice more before they reached their destination a nondescript door recessed in the inner wall of the corridor
the floor around it was littered with gifts
jormundur knocked and a quavering voice from inside asked who is it
lady nasuada come to see the child he said
be you of true heart and steadfast resolve
this time nasuada answered my heart is pure and my resolve is as iron
cross the threshold then and be welcome
the door swung open to an entryway lit by a single red dwarf lantern
