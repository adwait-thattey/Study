it was difficult for her to grasp the hilt as her fingers felt thick and clumsy and the muscles in her arm were slow to respond
it was as if the limb had fallen asleep save for the sharp burning lines scribed into her flesh
angela also pulled a dagger from somewhere in her clothes and she placed herself before nasuada and muttered a line of the ancient language
leaping to the ground solembum crouched next to angela
his fur stood on end making him appear larger than most dogs
he growled low in his throat
elva continued eating seemingly unperturbed by the commotion
she examined the morsel of bread she was holding between her thumb and index finger as one might inspect a strange species of insect and then dipped it into a goblet of wine and popped the bread into her mouth
my ** shouted a man
eragon and saphira fast approach from the **
nasuada sheathed her knife
pushing herself out of her chair she said to angela help me dress
angela held the garment open in front of nasuada who stepped into it
then angela gently guided nasuada is arms into the sleeves and when they were in place set about lacing up the back of the dress
elva joined her
together they soon had nasuada properly attired
nasuada surveyed her arms and saw no trace of her bandages
should i hide or reveal my injuries she asked
that depends said angela
do you think showing them will increase your standing or encourage your enemies because they assume you are weak and vulnerable the question is actually a rather philosophical one predicated on whether when looking at a man who has lost a big toe you say oh he is a cripple or oh he was smart or strong or lucky enough to escape worse **
the trial of the long knives is a contest of strength said elva
that is well known among the varden and surdans
are you proud of your strength nasuada
cut off the sleeves said nasuada
when they hesitated she said go ** at the elbows
do not mind the dress i shall have it repaired later
with a few deft movements angela removed the sections nasuada had identified and dropped the excess fabric on the table
nasuada lifted her chin
elva if you sense i am about to faint please tell angela and have her catch me
shall we then the three of them gathered into a tight formation with nasuada at the lead
solembum walked alone
as they exited the red pavilion the dwarf captain barked ** and the six present members of the nighthawks ranged themselves around nasuada is group the humans and dwarves fore and aft and the hulking kull urgals who stood eight feet and taller on either side
dusk spread its gold and purple wings over the varden is encampment lending a sense of mystery to the rows of canvas tents that extended beyond the limits of nasuada is sight
deepening shadows presaged the advent of night and countless torches and watchfires already glowed pure and bright in the warm twilight
the sky was clear to the east
south a long low cloud of black smoke hid the horizon and the burning plains which were a league and a half away
west a line of beeches and aspens marked the path of the jiet river upon which floated the dragon wing the ship jeod and roran and the other villagers from carvahall had pirated
but nasuada had eyes only for the north and the glittering shape of saphira descending thence
light from the fading sun still illuminated her cloaking her in a blue halo
she appeared like a cluster of stars falling from the heavens
the sight was so majestic nasuada stood transfixed for a moment thankful she was fortunate enough to witness it
they re ** she thought and breathed a sigh of relief
the warrior who had brought word of saphira is arrival a thin man with a large untrimmed beard bowed and then pointed
my lady as you can see i spoke the truth
yes
you did well
you must have exceedingly sharp eyes to have spotted saphira earlier
what is your name
fletcher son of harden my lady
you have my thanks fletcher
you may return to your post now
with another bow the man trotted off toward the edge of the camp
keeping her gaze fixed upon saphira nasuada picked her way between the rows of tents toward the large clearing set aside as a place for saphira to land and take off
