looking at farica nasuada said wait for me ** the woman curtsied and then departed
once nasuada heard the door to the laboratory close she said orrin
have you taken leave of your senses
while you spend your time locked in here conducting experiments that no one understands endangering your well being in the process your country totters on the brink of war
a myriad issues await your decision and you stand here blowing smoke and playing with quicksilver
his face hardened
i am quite aware of my duties nasuada
you may lead the varden but i am still king of surda and you would do well to recall that before you speak so disrespectfully
need i remind you that your sanctuary here depends on my continued goodwill
she knew it was an idle threat many of the surdan people had relatives in the varden and vice versa
they were too closely linked for either of them to abandon the other
no the real reason that orrin had taken offense was the question of authority
since it was nigh impossible to keep large groups of armed warriors at the ready over extended periods of time as nasuada had learned feeding that many inactive people was a logistical nightmare the varden had begun taking jobs starting farms and otherwise assimilating into their host ** will that leave me eventually as the leader of a nonexistent army a general or councilor under orrin her position was precarious
if she moved too quickly or with too much initiative orrin would perceive it as a threat and turn against her especially now that she was cloaked in the glamour of the varden is victory in farthen dur
but if she waited too long they would lose their chance to exploit galbatorix is momentary weakness
her only advantage over the maze of opposition was her command of the one element that had instigated this act of the play eragon and saphira
she said i do not seek to undermine your command orrin
that was never my intention and i apologize if it appeared that ** he bowed his neck with a stiff bob
unsure of how to continue she leaned on her fingertips against the lip of the bench
it is only
so many things must be done
i work night and day i keep a tablet beside my bed for notes and yet i never catch up i feel as if we are always balanced on the brink of disaster
orrin picked up a pestle stained black from use and rolled it between his palms with a steady hypnotic rhythm
before you came here
no that is not right
before your rider materialized fully formed from the ethers like moratensis from his fountain i expected to live my life as my father and grandfather before me
that is opposing galbatorix in secret
you must excuse me if it takes a while to accustom myself to this new reality
it was as much contrition as she could expect in return
i understand
he stopped the pestle in its path for a brief moment
you are newly come to your power whereas i have held mine for a number of years
if i may be arrogant enough to offer advice i ve found that it is essential for my sanity to allocate a certain portion of the day for my own interests
i could not do that objected nasuada
every moment i waste might be the moment of effort that is needed to defeat galbatorix
the pestle paused again
you do the varden a disservice if you insist on overworking yourself
no one can function properly without occasional peace and quiet
they do not have to be long breaks just five or ten minutes
you could even practice your archery and then you would still serve your goals albeit in a different manner
that is why i had this laboratory constructed in the first place
that is why i blow smoke and play with quicksilver as you put it so that i do not scream with frustration throughout the rest of the day
despite her reluctance to surrender her view of orrin as a feckless layabout nasuada could not help but acknowledge the validity of his argument
i will keep your recommendation in mind
some of his former levity returned as he smiled
that is all i ask
walking to the window she pushed the shutters farther open and gazed down upon aberon with its cries of quick fingered merchants hawking their wares to unsuspecting customers the clotted yellow dust blowing from the western road as a caravan approached the city gates the air that shimmered over clay tile roofs and carried the scent of cardus weed and incense from the marble temples and the fields that surrounded aberon like the outstretched petals of a flower
