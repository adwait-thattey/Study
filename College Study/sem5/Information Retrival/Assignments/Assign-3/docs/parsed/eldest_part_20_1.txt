the valley widened throughout the morning as the rafts swept toward a bright gap between two mountains
they reached the opening at midday and found themselves looking out of shadow upon a sunny prairie that faded into the north
then the current pushed them beyond the frosted crags and the walls of the world dropped away to reveal a gigantic sky and flat horizon
almost immediately the air grew warmer
the az ragni curved to the east edging the foothills of the mountain range on one side and the plains on the other
the amount of open space seemed to unsettle the dwarves
they muttered among themselves and glanced longingly at the cavernous rift behind them
eragon found the sunlight invigorating
it was hard to ever really feel awake when three quarters of the day was spent in twilight
behind his raft saphira launched herself out of the water and flew up over the prairie until she dwindled to a winking speck in the azure dome above
i see vast herds of gazelles to the north and east
to the west the hadarac desert
that is all
no one else no urgals slavers or nomads
that evening thorv chose a small cove for their camp
while duthmer fixed dinner eragon cleared a space beside his tent then drew zar roc and settled into the ready stance brom had taught him when they first sparred
eragon knew he was at a disadvantage compared to the elves and he had no intention of arriving in ellesmera out of practice
with excruciating slowness he looped zar roc over his head and brought it back down with both hands as if to cleave an enemy is helm
he held the pose for a second
keeping his motion under complete control he pivoted to the right twisting zar roc is point to parry an imaginary blow then stopped with rigid arms
out of the corner of his eye eragon noticed orik arya and thorv watching
he ignored them and focused only on the ruby blade in his hands he held it as if it were a snake that could writhe out of his grip and bite his arm
turning again he commenced a series of forms flowing from one to another with disciplined ease as he gradually increased his speed
in his mind he was no longer in the shadowy cove but surrounded by a knot of ferocious urgals and kull
he ducked and slashed parried riposted jumped to the side and stabbed in a whirl of activity
he fought with mindless energy as he had in farthen dur with no thought for the safety of his own flesh dashing and tearing aside his imagined enemies
he spun zar roc around in an attempt to flip the hilt from one palm to another then dropped the sword as a jagged line of pain bisected his back
he staggered and fell
above him he could hear arya and the dwarves babbling but all he saw was a constellation of sparkling red haze like a bloody veil dropped over the world
no sensation existed other than pain
it blotted out thought and reason leaving only a feral animal that screamed for release
when eragon recovered enough to notice his whereabouts he found that he had been placed inside his tent and wrapped tightly with blankets
arya sat beside him while saphira is head stuck through the entrance flaps
a while
you slept a little at the end
i tried to draw you from your body into mine and shield you from the pain but i could do little with you unconscious
eragon nodded and closed his eyes
his entire body throbbed
taking a deep breath he looked up at arya and quietly asked how can i train
how can i fight or use magic
i am a broken ** his face felt heavy with age as he spoke
she answered just as softly you can sit and watch
you can listen
you can read
and you can learn
despite her words he heard a hitch of uncertainty even fear in her voice
he rolled onto his side to avoid meeting her eyes
it shamed him to appear so helpless before her
how did the shade do this to me
i have no answers eragon
i am neither the wisest nor the strongest elf
we all do our best and you cannot be blamed for it
perhaps time will heal your ** arya pressed her fingers to his brow and murmured se mor ranr ono finna then left the tent
eragon sat and winced as his cramped back muscles stretched
