the empire has violated my home
so thought roran as he listened to the anguished moans of the men injured during the previous night is battle with the ra zac and soldiers
roran shuddered with fear and rage until his whole body was consumed with feverish chills that left his cheeks burning and his breath short
and he was sad so very sad
as if the ra zac is deeds had destroyed the innocence of his childhood haunts
leaving the healer gertrude tending to the wounded roran continued toward horst is house noting the makeshift barriers that filled the gaps between buildings the boards the barrels the piles of rocks and the splintered frames of the two wagons destroyed by the ra zac is explosives
it all seemed pitifully fragile
the few people who moved through carvahall were glassy eyed with shock grief and exhaustion
roran was tired too more than he could ever remember being
he had not slept since the night before last and his arms and back ached from the fighting
he entered horst is house and saw elain standing by the open doorway to the dining room listening to the steady burn of conversation that emanated from within
she beckoned him over
after they had foiled the ra zac is counterattack the prominent members of carvahall had sequestered themselves in an attempt to decide what action the village should take and if horst and his allies should be punished for initiating the hostilities
the group had been in deliberation most of the morning
roran peeked into the room
seated around the long table were birgit loring sloan gedric delwin fisk morn and a number of others
horst presided at the head of the table
and i say that it was stupid and ** exclaimed kiselt propping himself upright on his bony elbows
you had no cause to endanger
morn waved a hand
we ve been over this before
whether whathas been doneshould have been done is beside the point
i happen to agree with it quimby was my friend as much as anyone is and i shudder to think what those monsters would do with roran but
but what i want to know is how we can escape this predicament
easy kill the soldiers barked sloan
and then what more men will follow until we drown in a sea of crimson tunics
even if we surrender roran it will do no good you heard what the ra zac said they will kill us if we protect roran and enslave us if we do not
you may feel differently but as for myself i would rather die than spend my life as a ** morn shook his head his mouth set in a flat grim line
we cannot survive
fisk leaned forward
we could leave
there is nowhere to go retorted kiselt
we re backed against the spine the soldiers have blocked the road and beyond them is the rest of the empire
it is all your fault cried thane stabbing a shaking finger at horst
they will torch our houses and murder our children because of you
**
horst stood so quickly his chair toppled over backward
where is your honor man will you let them eat us without fighting back
yes if it means suicide ** thane glared around the table then stormed out past roran
his face was contorted by pure unadulterated fear
gedric spotted roran then and waved him in
come come we ve been waiting for you
roran clasped his hands in the small of his back as scores of hard eyes inspected him
how can i help
i think said gedric we ve all agreed that it would accomplish nothing to give you to the empire at this point
whether we would if that was not the case is neither here nor there
the only thing we can do is prepare for another attack
horst will make spearheads and other weapons if he has time and fisk has agreed to construct shields
fortunately his carpentry shop did not burn
and someone needs to oversee our defenses
we would like it to be you
you will have plenty of assistance
roran nodded
i will do my best
beside morn tara stood towering over her husband
she was a large woman with gray streaked black hair and strong hands that were just as capable of twisting off a chicken is head as separating a pair of brawlers
she said make sure you do roran else we will have more ** then she turned to horst
before we go any further there are men to bury
