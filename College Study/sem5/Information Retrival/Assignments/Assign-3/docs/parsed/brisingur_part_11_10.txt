they landed inches apart and then set off running between the houses toward the palisade
people will wonder where we went said eragon between strides
maybe we should have waited and left like normal travelers
it is riskier to stay
i paid for my room
that is all the innkeeper really cares about not whether we snuck out ** the two of them parted for a few seconds as they circumvented a decrepit wagon and then arya added the most important thing is to keep moving
if we linger the king will surely find us
when they arrived at the outer wall arya ranged along it until she found a post that protruded somewhat
she wrapped her hands around it and pulled testing the wood with her weight
the post swayed and rattled against its neighbors but otherwise held
with a sigh of impatience she tapped her bodice
a dress is somewhat breezier than a pair of leggings eragon
heat flooded his cheeks as he caught her meaning
reaching above his head he got a good grip and then began to climb the palisade bracing himself with his knees and feet during the ascent
at the top he stopped and balanced on the tips of the sharpened posts
** said eragon and pointed
a lantern floated in the darkness between a pair of nearby houses
as the light approached the gilded outline of a man emerged from the gloom
he carried a naked sword in one hand
silent as a specter arya grasped the post and using only the strength of her arms pulled herself hand over hand toward eragon
she seemed to glide upward as if by magic
when she was close enough eragon seized her right forearm and lifted her above the remainder of the posts setting her down next to him
like two strange birds they perched on the palisade motionless and breathless as the watchman walked underneath them
he swung the lantern in either direction searching for intruders
do not look at the ground pleaded eragon
and do not look up
a moment later the watchman sheathed his sword and continued on his rounds humming to himself
without a word eragon and arya dropped to the other side of the palisade
the armor in eragon is pack rattled as he struck the grass covered bank below and rolled to dissipate the force of the impact
springing to his feet he bent low and dashed away from eastcroft over the gray landscape arya close behind
they kept to hollows and dry streambeds as they skirted the farms that surrounded the village
a half dozen times indignant dogs ran out to protest the invasion of their territories
eragon tried to calm them with his mind but the only way he found to stop the dogs from barking was to assure them that their terrible teeth and claws had scared him and arya away
pleased with their success the dogs pranced with wagging tails back to the barns sheds and porches where they had been standing guard over their fiefdoms
their smug confidence amused eragon
five miles from eastcroft when it became apparent they were utterly alone and no one was trailing them eragon and arya drew to a halt by a charred stump
kneeling arya scooped several handfuls of dirt from the ground in front of her
adurna risa she said
with a faint trickle water welled out of the surrounding soil and poured into the hole she had dug
arya waited until the water filled the cavity and then said letta and the flow ceased
she intoned a spell of scrying and nasuada is face appeared upon the surface of the still water
arya greeted her
my lady eragon said and bowed
eragon she replied
she appeared tired hollow cheeked as if she had suffered a long illness
a lock snapped free of her bun and coiled itself into a tight knot at her hairline
eragon glimpsed a row of bulky bandages on her arm as she slid a hand over her head pressing the rebellious hair flat
you are safe thank gokukara
we were so worried
i am sorry i upset you but i had my reasons
you must explain them to me when you arrive
as you wish he said
how were you hurt did someone attack you why have not any of du vrangr gata healed you
i ordered them to leave me alone
and that i will explain when you ** thoroughly puzzled eragon nodded and swallowed his questions
