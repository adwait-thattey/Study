he resumed the process careful to avoid draining the elf is vitality and when he was ready commanded **
silent as the night a sphere of water a foot wide rose from the brook until it floated at eye level across from eragon
and while eragon experienced the usual strain that results from intense effort the spell itself caused him no fatigue
the sphere was only in the air for a moment when a wave of death rolled through the smaller creatures eragon was in contact with
a line of ants keeled over motionless
a baby mouse gasped and entered the void as it lost the strength to keep its heart beating
countless plants withered and crumbled and became inert as dust
eragon flinched horrified by what he had caused
given his new respect for the sanctity of life he found the crime appalling
what made it worse was that he was intimately linked with each being as it ceased to exist it was as if he himself were dying over and over
he severed the flow of magic letting the sphere of water splash across the ground and then whirled on oromis and growled you knew that would **
an expression of profound sorrow engulfed the ancient rider
it was necessary he replied
necessary that so many had to die
necessary that you understand the terrible price of using this type of magic
mere words cannot convey the feeling of having those whose minds you share die
you had to experience it for yourself
i wo not do that again vowed eragon
nor will you have to
if you are disciplined you can choose to draw the power only from plants and animals that can withstand the loss
it is impractical in battle but you may do so in your ** oromis gestured at him and still simmering eragon allowed the elf to lean on him as they returned to the hut
you see why this technique was not taught to younger riders
if it were to become known to a spellweaver of evil disposition he or she could wreak vast amounts of destruction especially since it would be difficult to stop anyone with access to so much ** once they were back inside the elf sighed lowered himself into his chair and pressed the tips of his fingers together
eragon sat as well
since it is possible to absorb energy from he waved his hand fromlife is it also possible to absorb it directly from light or fire or from any of the other forms of energy
ah eragon if it were we could destroy galbatorix in an instant
we can exchange energy with other living beings we can use that energy to move our bodies or to fuel a spell and we can even store that energy in certain objects for later use but we cannot assimilate the fundamental forces of nature
reason says that it can be done but no one has managed to devise a spell that allows it
nine days later eragon presented himself to oromis and said master it struck me last night that neither you nor the hundreds of elven scrolls i ve read have mentioned your religion
what do elves believe
a long sigh was oromis is first answer
then we believe that the world behaves according to certain inviolable rules and that by persistent effort we can discover those rules and use them to predict events when circumstances repeat
eragon blinked
that did not tell him what he wanted to know
but who or what do you worship
you worship the concept of nothing
no eragon
we do not worship at all
the thought was so alien it took eragon several moments to grasp what oromis meant
the villagers of carvahall lacked a single overriding doctrine but they did share a collection of superstitions and rituals most of which concerned warding off bad luck
during the course of his training it had dawned upon eragon that many of the phenomena that the villagers attributed to supernatural sources were in fact natural processes such as when he learned in his meditations that maggots hatched from fly eggs instead of spontaneously arising from the dirt as he had thought before
nor did it make sense for him to put out an offering of food to keep sprites from turning the milk sour when he knew that sour milk was actually caused by a proliferation of tiny organisms in the liquid
