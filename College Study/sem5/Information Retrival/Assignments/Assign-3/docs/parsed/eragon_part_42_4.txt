he proposed that the egg be ferried between the varden and the elves every year
at each place children would parade past it and then the bearers of the egg would wait to see if the dragon would hatch
if it did not they would leave and return to the other group
but if the dragondid hatch the new rider is training would be undertaken immediately
for the first year or so he or she would be instructed here by brom
then the rider would be taken to the elves who would finish the education
the elves reluctantly accepted this plan
with the stipulation that if brom were to die before the dragon hatched they would be free to train the new rider without interference
the agreement was slanted in their favor we both knew that the dragon would likely chose an elf but it provided a desperately needed semblance of equality
ajihad paused his rich eyes somber
shadows bit into his face under his cheekbones making them jut out
it was hoped that this new rider would bring our two races closer together
we waited for well over a decade but the egg never hatched
the matter passed from our minds and we rarely thought about it except to lament the egg is inactivity
then last year we suffered a terrible loss
arya and the egg disappeared on her return from tronjheim to the elven city osilon
the elves were the first to discover she was missing
they found her steed and guards slain in du weldenvarden and a group of slaughtered urgals nearby
but neither arya nor the egg was there
when this news reached me i feared that urgals had both of them and would soon learn the location of farthen dur and the elves capital ellesmera where their queen islanzadi lives
now i understand they were working for the empire which is far worse
we wo not know exactly what occurred during that attack until arya wakes but i have deduced a few details from what you ve ** ajihad is vest rustled as he leaned his elbows on the desk
the attack must have been swift and decisive else arya would have escaped
without any warning and deprived of a place to hide she could have done only one thing used magic to transport the egg elsewhere
she can use magic asked eragon
arya had mentioned that she had been given a drug to suppress her power he wanted to confirm that she meant magic
he wondered if she could teach him more words of the ancient language
it was one of the reasons why she was chosen to guard the egg
anyway arya could not have returned it to us she was too far away and the elves realm is warded by arcane barriers that prevent anything from entering their borders through magical means
she must have thought of brom and in desperation sent the egg toward carvahall
without time to prepare i am not surprised she missed by the margin she did
the twins tell me it is an imprecise art
why was she closer to palancar valley than the varden asked eragon
where do the elves really live where is this
ellesmera
ajihad is keen gaze bored into eragon as he considered the question
i do not tell you this lightly for the elves guard the knowledge jealously
but you should know and i do this as a display of trust
their cities lie far to the north in the deepest reaches of the endless forest du weldenvarden
not since the riders time has anyone dwarf or human been elf friend enough to walk in their leafy halls
i do not even know how to find ellesmera
as for osilon
based on where arya disappeared i suspect it is near du weldenvarden is western edge toward carvahall
you must have many other questions but bear with me and keep them until i have finished
he gathered his memories then spoke at a quickened pace
when arya disappeared the elves withdrew their support from the varden
queen islanzadi was especially enraged and refused any further contact with us
as a result even though i received brom is message the elves are still ignorant of you and saphira
without their supplies to sustain my troops we have fared badly these past months in skirmishes with the empire
with arya is return and your arrival i expect the queen is hostility will abate
the fact that you rescued arya will greatly help our case with her
