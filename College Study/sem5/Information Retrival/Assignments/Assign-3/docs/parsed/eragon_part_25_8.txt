because said brom patiently to scry you have to know what you re looking at and where to direct your power
even if a stranger was described to you it would still be nigh impossible to view him not to mention the ground and whatever else might be around him
you have to knowwhat you re going to scry before youcan scry it
does that answer your question
eragon thought for a moment
but how is it done do you conjure up the image in thin air
not usually said brom shaking his white head
that takes more energy than projecting it onto a reflective surface like a pool of water or a mirror
some riders used to travel everywhere they could trying to see as much as possible
then whenever war or some other calamity occurred they would be able to view events throughout alagaesia
may i try it asked eragon
brom looked at him carefully
no not now
you re tired and scrying takes lots of strength
i will tell you the words but you must promise not to attempt it tonight
and i d rather you wait until we leave teirm i have more to teach you
very ** brom bent over and very quietly whispered draumr kopa into eragon is ear
eragon took a moment to memorize the words
maybe after we ve left teirm i can scry roran
i would like to know how he is doing
i am afraid that the ra zac might go after him
i do not mean to frighten you but that is a distinct possibility said brom
although roran was gone most of the time the ra zac were in carvahall i am sure that they asked questions about him
who knows they may have even met him while they were in therinsford
either way i doubt their curiosity is sated
you re on the loose after all and the king is probably threatening them with terrible punishment if you are not found
if they get frustrated enough they will go back and interrogate roran
it is only a matter of time
if that is true then the only way to keep roran safe is to let the ra zac know where i am so that they will come after me instead of him
no that wo not work either
you re not thinking admonished brom
if you can not understand your enemies how can you expect to anticipate them even if you exposed your location the ra zac wouldstill chase roran
do you know why
eragon straightened and tried to consider every possibility
well if i stay in hiding long enough they might get frustrated and capture roran to force me to reveal myself
if that did not work they d kill him just to hurt me
also if i become a public enemy of the empire they might use him as bait to catch me
and if i met with roran and they found out about it they would torture him to find out where i was
very good
you figured that out quite nicely said brom
but what is the solution i can not let him be **
brom clasped his hands loosely
the solution is quite obvious
roran is going to have to learn how to defend himself
that may sound hard hearted but as you pointed out you cannot risk meeting with him
you may not remember this you were half delirious at the time but when we left carvahall i told you that i had left a warning letter for roran so he wo not be totally unprepared for danger
if he has any sense at all when the ra zac show up in carvahall again he will take my advice and flee
i do not like this said eragon unhappily
there is some good in all of this
the king cannot afford to have a rider roaming around that he does not control
galbatorix is the only known rider alive besides yourself but he would like another one under his command
before he tries to kill you or roran he will offer you the chance to serve him
unfortunately if he ever gets close enough to make that proposition it will be far too late for you to refuse and still live
it is all that is protecting roran
as long as the king does not know which side you ve chosen he wo not risk alienating you by harming your cousin
keep that firmly in mind
the ra zac killed garrow but i think it was an ill considered decision on their part
from what i know of galbatorix he would not have approved it unless he gained something from it
and how will i be able to deny the king is wishes when he is threatening me with death asked eragon sharply
