eragon and arya followed
the three of them wandered through the shabby building until they found a room the kitchen with a window large enough to accommodate saphira is head
eragon pushed opened the shutters and saphira laid her head on the wooden counter
her breath filled the kitchen with the smell of charred meat
we may speak without fear arya announced after casting spells that would prevent anyone from eavesdropping on their conversation
nasuada rubbed her arms and shivered
what is this all about eragon she asked
eragon swallowed wishing that he did not have to dwell upon oromis and glaedr is fate
then he said nasuada
saphira and i were not alone
there was another dragon and another rider fighting against galbatorix
i knew it breathed nasuada her eyes shining
it was the only explanation that made sense
they were your teachers in ellesmera were not they
they were said saphira but no more
eragon pressed his lips together and shook his head tears blurring his vision
just this morning they died at gil ead
galbatorix used thorn and murtagh to kill them i heard him speak to them with murtagh is tongue
the excitement drained from nasuada is face replaced by a dull empty expression
she sank into the nearest chair and stared at the cinders in the cold fireplace
the kitchen was silent
at last she stirred and said are you sure they are dead
nasuada wiped her eyes on the hem of her sleeve
tell me about them eragon
would you please
so for the next half hour eragon spoke of oromis and glaedr
he explained how they had survived the fall of the riders and why they had chosen to keep themselves hidden thereafter
he explained about their respective disabilities and he spent some time describing their personalities and what it had been like to study under them
eragon is sense of loss deepened as he remembered the long days he had spent with oromis on the crags of tel naeir and the many things the elf had done for him and saphira
as he came to their encounter with thorn and murtagh at gil ead saphira lifted her head off the counter and began to keen again her mournful wail soft and persistent
afterward nasuada sighed and said i wish i could have met oromis and glaedr but alas it was not to be
there is one thing i still do not understand eragon
you said you heard galbatorix speaking to them
how could you
yes i would like to know that as well said arya
eragon looked for something to drink but there was no water or wine in the kitchen
he coughed then launched into an account of their recent trip to ellesmera
saphira occasionally made a comment but for the most part she left it to him to tell the story
starting with the truth about his parentage eragon proceeded in quick succession through the events of their stay from their discovery of the brightsteel under the menoa tree to the forging of brisingr to his visit with sloan
last of all he told arya and nasuada about the dragons heart of hearts
well said nasuada
she stood and walked the length of the kitchen and then back again
you the son of brom and galbatorix leeching off the souls of dragons whose bodies have died
it is almost too much to comprehend
she rubbed her arms again
at least we now know the true source of galbatorix is power
arya stood motionless breathless her expression stunned
the dragons are still alive she whispered
she clasped her hands together in a prayer like fashion and held them against her chest
they are still alive after all these years
oh if only we could tell the rest of my race
how they would ** and how terrible their wrath would be when they heard of the enslavement of the ** we would run straight to uru baen and we would not rest until we had freed the hearts of galbatorix is control no matter how many of us died in the process
but we cannot tell them said saphira
no said arya and lowered her gaze
we cannot
but i wish we could
nasuada looked at her
please do not take offense but i wish that your mother queen islanzadi had seen fit to share this information with us
we could have made use of it long ago
i agree said arya frowning
