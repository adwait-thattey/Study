no said albriech shrugging him off
she has more pressing cases than ** he took a preparatory breath as if he were about to dive into a lake and lumbered off through the downpour in the direction of the forge
roran watched him go then shook his head and went inside
he found elain sitting on the floor with a row of children sharpening a pile of spearheads with files and whetstones
roran gestured to elain
once they were in another room he told her what had just occurred
elain swore harshly startling him for he had never heard her use such language then asked is there cause for thane to declare a feud
possibly admitted roran
they both insulted each other but albriech is oaths were the strongest
however thane did strike first
you could declare a feud yourself
nonsense asserted elain wrapping a shawl around her shoulders
this is a dispute for arbitrators to resolve
if we must pay a fine so be it as long as bloodshed is ** she headed out the front door a finished spear in hand
troubled roran located bread and meat in the kitchen then helped the children sharpen spearheads
once felda one of the mothers arrived roran left the children in her care and slogged back through carvahall to the main road
as he squatted in the mud a shaft of sunlight burst underneath the clouds and illuminated the folds of rain so each drop flashed with crystalline fire
roran stared awestruck ignoring the water streaming down his face
the rift in the clouds widened until a shelf of massive thunderheads hung over the western three quarters of palancar valley facing a strip of pure blue sky
because of the billowy roof above and the angle of the sun the rain drenched landscape was lit brilliantly on one side and painted with rich shadows on the other giving the fields bushes trees river and mountains the most extraordinary colors
it was as if the entire world had been transformed into a sculpture of burnished metal
just then movement caught roran is eye and he looked down to see a soldier standing on the road his mail shining like ice
the man gaped with amazement at carvahall is new fortifications then turned and fled back into the golden mist
** shouted roran jolting to his feet
he wished that he had his bow but he had left it inside to protect it from the elements
his only comfort was that the soldiers would have an even harder time keeping their weapons dry
men and women ran from their houses gathered along the trench and peered out through the wall of overlapping pines
the long branches wept beads of moisture translucent cabochons that reflected the rows of anxious eyes
roran found himself standing beside sloan
the butcher held one of fisk is makeshift shields in his left hand and in his right a cleaver curved like a half moon
his belt was festooned with at least a dozen knives all of them large and honed to a razor edge
he and roran exchanged brisk nods then refocused on where the soldier had disappeared
less than a minute later the disembodied voice of a ra zac slithered out of the mist by continuing to defend carvahall you proclaim your choice and ssseal your doom
you ssshall **
loring responded show your maggot riddled faces if you dare you lily livered bandy legged snake eyedwretches ** we will crack your skulls open and fatten our hogs on your **
a dark shape floated toward them followed by the dull thump of a spear embedding itself in a door an inch from gedric is left arm
take ** shouted horst from the middle of the line
roran knelt behind his shield and peered through a hairline gap between two of the boards
he was just in time for a half dozen spears hurtled over the wall of trees and buried themselves among the cowering villagers
from somewhere in the mist came an agonized scream
roran is heart jumped with a painful flutter
he panted for breath though he had not moved and his hands were slick with sweat
he heard the faint sound of shattering glass on the northern edge of carvahall
then the bellow of an explosion and crashing timbers
spinning around he and sloan sped through carvahall where they found a team of six soldiers dragging away the splintered remains of several trees
