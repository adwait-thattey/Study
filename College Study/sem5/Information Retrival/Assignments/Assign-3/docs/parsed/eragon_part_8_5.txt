scales bumped under his fingers as he patted it gently
a single word rang in his head deep and clear
it was solemn and sad as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed
he stared at the dragon and a cold tingle ran down his arm
a hard knot formed in his stomach as unfathomable sapphire eyes gazed back at him
for the first time he did not think of the dragon as an animal
it was something else something
different
he raced home trying to escape the ** dragon
