it ill becomes you
in any case i suspect the twins allowed you into battle unprotectednot so you would be killed but so that durza could capture you
by your own account ajihad suspected that the varden had been betrayed when galbatorix began persecuting their allies in the empire with near perfect accuracy
the twins were privy to the identities of the varden is collaborators
also the twins lured you to the heart of tronjheim thereby separating you from saphira and placing you within durza is reach
that they were traitors is the logical explanation
if theywere traitors said eragon it does not matter now they re long dead
oromis inclined his head
even so
arya said that the urgals did have magicians in farthen dur and that she fought many of them
none of them attacked you
more evidence that you and saphira were left for durza to capture and take to galbatorix
the trap was well laid
over the next hour oromis taught eragon twelve methods to kill none of which took more energy than lifting an ink laden pen
as he finished memorizing the last one a thought struck eragon that caused him to grin
the ra zac wo not stand a chance the next time they cross my path
you must still be wary of them cautioned oromis
why three words and they will be dead
and if a fish were slightly faster and more intelligent than its brethren would it be able to escape a hunting osprey
i doubt it said eragon
at least not for very long
just as ospreys are designed to be the best possible hunters of fish wolves are designed to be the best hunters of deer and other large game and every animal is gifted to best suit its purpose
so too are the ra zac designed to prey upon humans
they are the monsters in the dark the dripping nightmares that haunt your race
the back of eragon is neck prickled with horror
what manner of creatures are they
neither elf man dwarf dragon furred finned or feathered beast reptile insect nor any other category of animal
eragon forced a laugh
are they plants then
nor that either
they reproduce by laying eggs like dragons
when they hatch the young or pupae grow black exoskeletons that mimic the human form
it is a grotesque imitation but convincing enough to let the ra zac approach their victims without undo alarm
all areas where humans are weak the ra zac are strong
they can see on a cloudy night track a scent like a bloodhound jump higher and move faster
however bright light pains them and they have a morbid fear of deep water for they cannot swim
their greatest weapon is their evil breath which fogs the minds of humans incapacitating many though it is less potent on dwarves and elves are immune altogether
eragon shivered as he remembered his first sight of the ra zac in carvahall and how he had been unable to flee once they noticed him
it felt like a dream where i wanted to run but i could not move no matter how hard i tried
as good a description as any said oromis
though the ra zac cannot use magic they are not to be underestimated
if they know that you hunt them they will not reveal themselves but keep to the shadows where they are strong and plot to ambush you as they did by dras leona
even brom is experience could not protect him from them
never grow overconfident eragon
never grow arrogant for then you will be careless and your enemies will exploit your weakness
oromis fixed eragon with a steady gaze
the ra zac remain pupae for twenty years while they mature
on the first full moon of their twentieth year they shed their exoskeletons spread their wings and emerge as adults ready to hunt all creatures not just humans
then the ra zac is mounts the ones they fly on are really
