she was a huntress and endowed with all the savage beauty that the term implied
arya is angled features and panther grace perfectly matched the dragon beside her
no discrepancy existed between their demeanors as they stood bathed in dawn is first rays
a tingle of awe and joy shuddered along eragon is ** was where he belonged as a rider
of all the things in alagaesia he had been lucky enough to be joined withthis
the wonder of it brought tears to his eyes and a smile of wild exultation that dispelled all his doubts and fears in a surge of pure emotion
still smiling he mounted the hill and took his place by saphira as they surveyed the new day
arya looked at him
eragon met her gaze and something lurched within him
he flushed without knowing why feeling a sudden connection with her a sense that she understood him better than anyone other than saphira
his reaction confused him for no one had affected him in that manner before
throughout the rest of the day all eragon had to do was think back on that moment to make himself smile and set his insides churning with a mixture of odd sensations he could not identify
he spent most of his time seated against the raft is cabin working on orik is ring and watching the changing landscape
around midday they passed the mouth of a valley and another river melded into the az ragni doubling its size and speed until the shores were over a mile apart
it was all the dwarves could do to keep the rafts from being tossed like flotsam before the inexorable current and to avoid smashing into the trees that occasionally floated by
a mile after the rivers joined the az ragni turned north and flowed past a lonely cloud wreathed peak that stood separate from the main body of the beor range like a gigantic watchtower built to keep vigil over the plains
the dwarves bowed to the peak when they saw it and orik told eragon there is moldun the proud
he is the last true mountain we shall see on this journey
when the rafts were moored for the evening eragon saw orik unwrap a long black box inlaid with mother of pearl rubies and curved lines of silver
orik flicked a clasp then raised the lid to reveal an unstrung bow nestled in red velvet
the bow is reflexed limbs were ebony which formed the background for intricate patterns of vines flowers animals and runes all executed in the finest gold
it was such a luxurious weapon eragon wondered how anyone dared use it
orik strung the bow it was nearly as tall as he was but still no bigger than a child is bow by eragon is standards put the box away and said i am going to find some fresh meat
i will be back in an ** with that he disappeared into the brush
thorv grunted disapprovingly but made no move to stop him
true to his word orik returned with a brace of long necked geese
i found a flock of them perched in a tree he said tossing the birds to duthmer
as orik retrieved the bejeweled case eragon asked what kind of wood is your bow made of
wood orik laughed shaking his head
you can not make a bow this short out of wood and cast an arrow more than twenty yards it breaks or follows the string after a few shots
no this is an urgal horn **
eragon eyed him suspiciously sure that the dwarf was trying to fool him
horn is not flexible or springy enough to make a bow
ah chortled orik that is because you have to know how to treat it right
we first learned to do it with feldunost horns but it works just as well with an urgal is
it is done by cutting the horn in half lengthwise then trimming the outside coil until it is the right thickness
the strip is boiled flat and sanded into the final shape before being fixed to the belly of an ash stave with glue made from fish scales and the skin from the roof of trout is mouths
then the back of the stave is covered with multiple layers of sinew they give the bow itssnap
the last step is decoration
the entire process can take almost a decade
i ve never heard of a bow built like that before said eragon
it made his own weapon seem no more than a crudely hacked branch
how far does it shoot
see for yourself said orik
