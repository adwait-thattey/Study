behind the counter stood the butcher sloan
a small man he wore a cotton shirt and a long bloodstained smock
an impressive array of knives swung from his belt
he had a sallow pockmarked face and his black eyes were suspicious
he polished the counter with a ragged cloth
sloan is mouth twisted as eragon entered
well the mighty hunter joins the rest of us mortals
how many did you bag this time
none was eragon is curt reply
he had never liked sloan
the butcher always treated him with disdain as if he were something unclean
a widower sloan seemed to care for only one person his daughter katrina on whom he doted
i am amazed said sloan with affected astonishment
he turned his back on eragon to scrape something off the wall
and that is your reason for coming here
if that is the case let is see your ** sloan tapped his fingers when eragon shifted his feet and remained silent
come on either you have it or you do not
which is it
i do not really have any money but i do
what no money the butcher cut him off sharply
and you expect to buy ** are the other merchants giving away their wares should i just hand you the goods without charge besides he said abruptly it is late
come back tomorrow with money
i am closed for the day
eragon glared at him
i can not wait until tomorrow sloan
it will be worth your while though i found something to pay you ** he pulled out the stone with a flourish and set it gently on the scarred counter where it gleamed with light from the dancing flames
stole it is more likely muttered sloan leaning forward with an interested expression
ignoring the comment eragon asked will this be enough
sloan picked up the stone and gauged its weight speculatively
he ran his hands over its smoothness and inspected the white veins
with a calculating look he set it down
it is pretty but how much is it worth
i do not know admitted eragon but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it unless it had some value
obviously said sloan with exaggerated patience
but how much value since you do not know i suggest that you find a trader who does or take my offer of three crowns
that is a miser is ** it must be worth at least ten times that protested eragon
three crowns would not even buy enough meat to last a week
sloan shrugged
if you do not like my offer wait until the traders arrive
either way i am tired of this conversation
the traders were a nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited carvahall every spring and winter
they bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers had managed to grow or make and sold what they needed to live through another year seeds animals fabric and supplies like salt and sugar
but eragon did not want to wait until they arrived it could be a while and his family needed the meat now
fine i accept he snapped
good i will get you the meat
not that it matters but where did you find this
two nights ago in the spine
get ** demanded sloan pushing the stone away
he stomped furiously to the end of the counter and started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife
why asked eragon
he drew the stone closer as if to protect it from sloan is wrath
i wo not deal with anything you bring back from those damned ** take your sorcerer is stone ** sloan is hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the knife but he seemed not to notice
he continued to scrub staining the blade with fresh blood
you refuse to sell to **
** unless you pay with coins sloan growled and hefted the knife sidling away
go before i make **
the door behind them slammed open
eragon whirled around ready for more trouble
in stomped horst a hulking man
sloan is daughter katrina a tall girl of sixteen trailed behind him with a determined expression
eragon was surprised to see her she usually absented herself from any arguments involving her father
sloan glanced at them warily then started to accuse eragon
he wo not
quiet announced horst in a rumbling voice cracking his knuckles at the same time
he was carvahall is smith as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested
his powerful arms were bare to the elbow a great expanse of hairy muscular chest was visible through the top of his shirt
