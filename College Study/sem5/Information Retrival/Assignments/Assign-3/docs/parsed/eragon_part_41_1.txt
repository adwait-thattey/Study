this way snapped the bald man
he stepped back keeping the dagger pressed under murtagh is chin then wheeled to the right disappearing through an arched doorway
the warriors cautiously followed him their attention centered on eragon and saphira
the horses were led into a different tunnel
dazed by the turn of events eragon started after murtagh
he glanced at saphira to confirm that arya was still tied to her ** has to get the ** he thought frantically knowing that even then the skilna bragh was fulfilling its deadly purpose within her flesh
he hurried through the arched doorway and down a narrow corridor after the bald man
the warriors kept their weapons pointed at him
they swept past a sculpture of a peculiar animal with thick quills
the corridor curved sharply to the left then to the right
a door opened and they entered a bare room large enough for saphira to move around with ease
there was a hollow boom as the door closed followed by a loud scrape as a bolt was secured on the outside
eragon slowly examined his surroundings zar roc tight in his hand
the walls floor and ceiling were made of polished white marble that reflected a ghost image of everyone like a mirror of veined milk
one of the unusual lanterns hung in each corner
there is an injured he began but a sharp gesture from the bald man cut him off
do not ** it must wait until you have been ** he shoved murtagh over to one of the warriors who pressed a sword against murtagh is neck
the bald man clasped his hands together softly
remove your weapons and slide them to ** a dwarf unbuckled murtagh is sword and dropped it on the floor with a clank
loath to be parted with zar roc eragon unfastened the sheath and set it and the blade on the floor
he placed his bow and quiver next to them then pushed the pile toward the warriors
now step away from your dragon and slowly approach me commanded the bald man
puzzled eragon moved forward
when they were a yard apart the man said stop ** now remove the defenses from around your mind and prepare to let me inspect your thoughts and memories
if you try to hide anything from me i will take what i want by force
which would drive you mad
if you do not submit your companion will be killed
to be sure you are not in galbatorix is service and to understand why hundreds of urgals are banging on our front door growled the bald man
his close set eyes shifted from point to point with cunning speed
no one may enter farthen dur without being tested
there is not time
we need a ** protested eragon
** roared the man pressing down his robe with thin fingers
until you are examined your words are **
but she is ** retorted eragon angrily pointing at arya
they were in a precarious position but he would let nothing else happen until arya was cared for
it will have to ** no one will leave this room until we have discovered the truth of this matter
unless you wish
the dwarf who had saved eragon from the lake jumped forward
are you blind egraz carn ca not you see that is an elf on the dragon we cannot keep her here if she is in danger
ajihad and the king will have our heads if she is allowed to **
the man is eyes tightened with anger
after a moment he relaxed and said smoothly of course orik we would not want that to ** he snapped his fingers and pointed at arya
remove her from the ** two human warriors sheathed their swords and hesitantly approached saphira who watched them steadily
quickly **
the men unstrapped arya from the saddle and lowered the elf to the floor
one of the men inspected her face then said sharply it is the dragon egg courier **
what exclaimed the bald man
the dwarf orik is eyes widened with astonishment
the bald man fixed his steely gaze on eragon and said flatly you have much explaining to do
eragon returned the intense stare with all the determination he could muster
she was poisoned with the skilna bragh while in prison
only tunivor is nectar can save her now
the bald man is face became inscrutable
he stood motionless except for his lips which twitched occasionally
very well
take her to the healers and tell them what she needs
