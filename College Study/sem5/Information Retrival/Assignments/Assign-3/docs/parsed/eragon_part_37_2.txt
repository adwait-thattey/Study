they had covered over sixteen leagues in one day
eragon leaned against snowfire is neck happy with the distance they had gone
let is find a gully or hollow where we can sleep ** they stopped at a small stand of juniper trees and laid their blankets beneath them
saphira waited patiently as they untied the elf from her belly
i will take the first watch and wake you at midmorning said murtagh setting his bare sword across his knees
eragon mumbled his assent and pulled the blankets over his shoulders
nightfall found them worn and drowsy but determined to continue
as they prepared to leave saphira observed to eragon this is the third night since we rescued you from gil ead and the elf still has not woken
i am worried
and she continued she has neither drunk nor eaten in that time
i know little of elves but she is slender and i doubt she can survive much longer without nourishment
what is wrong asked murtagh over tornac is back
the elf said eragon looking down at her
saphira is troubled that she has not woken or eaten it disturbs me too
i healed her wounds at least on the surface but it does not seem to have done her any good
maybe the shade tampered with her mind suggested murtagh
then we have to help her
murtagh knelt by the elf
he examined her intently then shook his head and stood
as far as i can tell she is only sleeping
it seems as if i could wake her with a word or a touch yet she slumbers on
her coma might be something elves self induce to escape the pain of injury but if so why does not she end it there is no danger to her now
but does she know that asked eragon quietly
murtagh put a hand on his shoulder
this must wait
we have to leave now or risk losing our hard won lead
you can tend to her later when we stop
one thing first said eragon
he soaked a rag then squeezed the cloth so water dripped between the elf is sculpted lips
he did that several times and dabbed above her straight angled eyebrows feeling oddly protective
they headed through the hills avoiding the tops for fear of being spotted by sentries
saphira stayed with them on the ground for the same reason
despite her bulk she was stealthy only her tail could be heard scraping over the ground like a thick blue snake
eventually the sky brightened in the east
the morning star aiedail appeared as they reached the edge of a steep bank covered with mounds of brush
water roared below as it tore over boulders and sluiced through branches
the ** said eragon over the noise
murtagh nodded
** we have to find a place to ford safely
that is not necessary said ** can carry you across no matter how wide the river is
eragon looked up at her blue gray ** about the horses we can not leave them behind
they re too heavy for you to lift
as long as you re not on them and they do not struggle too much i am sure that i can carry them
if i can dodge arrows with three people on my back i can certainly fly a horse in a straight line over a river
i believe you but let is not attempt it unless we have to
it is too dangerous
she clambered down the ** can not afford to squander time here
eragon followed her leading snowfire
the bank came to an abrupt end at the ramr where the river ran dark and swift
white mist wafted up from the water like blood steaming in winter
it was impossible to see the far side
murtagh tossed a branch into the torrent and watched it race away bobbing on the rough water
how deep do you think it is asked eragon
i can not tell said murtagh worry coloring his voice
can you see how far across it is with magic
i do not think so not without lighting up this place like a beacon
with a gust of air saphira took off and soared over the ramr
after a short time she said i am on the other bank
the river is over a half mile wide
you could not have chosen a worse place to cross the ramr bends at this point and is at its widest
a half ** exclaimed eragon
he told murtagh about saphira is offer to fly them
i d rather not try it for the horses sake
tornac is not as accustomed to saphira as snowfire
he might panic and injure them both
ask saphira to look for shallows where we can swim over safely
