ah i must go now
pray to sindri for luck would you we are about to venture into a lava field none have dared cross before
when all of the clan chiefs were seated around the table in the center of the room those watching from the perimeter including eragon took their own seats from among the ring of chairs set against the curving wall
eragon did not relax into his however as many of the dwarves did but sat upon the edge ready to fight at the slightest hint of danger
as gannel the black eyed warrior priest of durgrimst quan rose from the table and began to speak in dwarvish hundfast sidled closer to eragon is right side and murmured a continuous translation
the dwarf said greetings again mine fellow clan chiefs
but whether tis well met or not i am undecided for certain disturbing rumors rumors of rumors if truth be told have reached mine ears
i have no information beyond these vague and worrisome mutterings nor proof upon which to found an accusation of misdeeds
however as today is mine day to preside over this our congregation i propose that we delay our most serious debates for the moment and if you are agreeable allow me to pose a few questions to the meet
the clan chiefs muttered among themselves and then iorunn bright dimpling iorunn said i have no objection grimstborith gannel
you have aroused mine curiosity with these cryptic insinuations
let us hear what questions you have
aye let us hear them said nado
let us hear them agreed manndrath and all the rest of the clan chiefs including vermund
having received the permission he sought gannel rested his knuckles upon the table and was silent for a span garnering the attention of everyone in the room
then he spoke
yesterday while we were lunching in our chosen places of repast knurlan throughout the tunnels underneath the southern quadrant of tronjheim heard a noise
reports of its loudness differ but that so many noticed it over so large an area proves that it was no small disturbance
like you i received the usual warnings of a possible cave in
what you may not be aware of however is that just two hours past
hundfast hesitated and quickly whispered the word is difficult to render in this tongue
runners of the tunnels i ** and then he resumed translating as before
runners of the tunnels discovered evidence of a mighty fight within one of the ancient tunnels that our famed forefather korgan longbeard excavated
the floor was painted with blood the walls were dark with soot from a lantern a warrior of careless blade did breach cracks split the surrounding stone and sprawled throughout were seven charred and mangled bodies with signs that others may have been removed
nor were these the remnants of some obscure skirmish from the battle of farthen dur
** for the blood had yet to dry the soot was soft the cracks were most obviously freshly broken and i am told the residue of powerful magics could still be detected within the area
even now several of our most accomplished spellcasters are attempting to reconstruct a pictorial facsimile of what occurred but they have little hope of success as those involved were wrapped about with such devious enchantments
so my first question for the meet is this do any of you possess further knowledge of this mysterious action
as gannel concluded his speech eragon tensed his legs ready to spring up if the purple veiled dwarves of az sweldn rak anhuin should reach for their blades
orik cleared his throat and said i believe that i can satisfy some of your curiosity upon that point gannel
however since my answer must of necessity be a lengthy one i suggest you ask your other questions before i begin
a frown darkened gannel is brow
rapping his knuckles against the table he said very well
in what is undoubtedly related to the clash of arms in korgan is tunnels i have had reports of numerous knurlan moving through tronjheim and with furtive intent gathering here and there into large bands of armed men
my agents were unable to ascertain the clan of the warriors but that any of this council should attempt to surreptitiously marshal their forces whilst we are engaged in a meet to decide who should succeed king hrothgar suggests motives of the darkest kind
