roran killed several of the soldiers himself but for the most part he hung back and concentrated upon directing the assault as was his responsibility now
he was still stiff and sore from the flogging he had endured and he did not want to exert himself any more than necessary for fear of cracking the mat of scabs that covered his back
until that point roran had had no difficulty maintaining discipline among the twenty humans and twenty urgals
although it was obvious that neither group liked nor trusted the other an attitude he shared for he regarded the urgals with the same degree of suspicion and distaste as would any man who had been raised in proximity to the spine they had succeeded in working together during the past three days with nary a raised voice
that both groups had managed to cooperate so well had he knew little to do with his prowess as a commander
nasuada and nar garzhvog had taken great care in picking the warriors who were to travel with him selecting only those with a reputation for a quick blade sound judgment and above all a calm and even disposition
however in the aftermath of the attack on the supply train as his men were busy dragging the bodies of the soldiers and the wagoners into a pile and roran was riding up and down the line of wagons overseeing the work he heard an agonized howl from somewhere by the far end of the train
thinking that perhaps another contingent of soldiers had chanced upon them roran shouted to carn and several other men to join him and then touched his spurs to snowfire is flanks and galloped toward the rear of the wagons
four urgals had tied an enemy soldier to the trunk of a gnarled willow tree and were amusing themselves by poking and prodding him with their swords
swearing roran jumped down from snowfire and with a single blow of his hammer put the man out of his misery
a swirling cloud of dust swept over the group as carn and four other warriors galloped up to the willow tree
they reined in their steeds and spread out on either side of roran holding their weapons at the ready
the largest urgal a ram named yarbog stepped forward
stronghammer why did you stop our sport he would have danced for us for many more minutes
from between clenched teeth roran said so long as you are under my command you will not torture captives without cause
am i understood many of these soldiers have been forced to serve galbatorix against their will
many of them are our friends or family or neighbors and while we must fight them i will not have you treat them with unnecessary cruelty
if not for the whims of fate any one of us humans might be standing in their place
they are not our enemy galbatorix is as he is yours
the urgal is heavy brow beetled nearly obscuring his deep set yellow eyes
but you will still kill them yes why cannot we enjoy seeing them wriggle and dance first
roran wondered if the urgal is skull was too thick to crack with his hammer
struggling to restrain his anger he said because it is wrong if nothing ** pointing at the dead soldier he said what if he had been one of your own race who had been enthralled by the shade durza would you have tormented him as well
of course said yarbog
they would want us to tickle them with our swords so that they would have an opportunity to prove their bravery before they died
is it not the same with you hornless humans or have you no stomach for pain
roran was not sure how serious an insult it was among the urgals to call another hornless but even so he had no doubt that questioning someone is courage was as offensive to urgals as it was to humans if not more so
any one of us could withstand more pain without crying out than you yarbog he said tightening his grip on his hammer and shield
now unless you wish to experience agony the likes of which you cannot imagine surrender your sword to me then untie that poor wretch and carry him over to the rest of the bodies
after that go see to the packhorses
they are yours to care for until we return to the varden
without waiting for an acknowledgment from the urgal roran turned and grasped snowfire is reins and prepared to climb back onto the stallion
