saphira and i came as fast as we could
how is katrina
once this is over you will have to tell me everything that is happened to you since i left
roran pressed his lips together and nodded
then he pointed at brisingr and said where did you get the sword
bris eragon started to say but then the eleven other elves whom islanzadi had assigned to protect him and saphira sprinted out of the column of men and surrounded the two of them
arya and blodhgarm rejoined them as well arya wiping clean the slim blade of her sword
before eragon could resume speaking jormundur rode through the gates and hailed him shouting ** well met **
eragon greeted him in return and asked what should we do now
whatever you see fit jormundur replied reining in his brown charger
we have to fight our way up to the keep
it does not look as if saphira would fit between most of the houses so fly around and harry their forces where you can
if you could break open the keep or capture lady lorana it would be a great help
jormundur gestured over his shoulder
at the rear of the army coordinating our forces with king ** jormundur glanced out over the influx of warriors then looked back at eragon and roran
stronghammer your place is with your men not gossiping with your ** then the lean wiry commander spurred his horse forward and rode up the gloomy street shouting orders to the varden
as roran and arya started to follow eragon grabbed roran by the shoulder and tapped arya is blade with his own
wait he said
** both arya and roran demanded in exasperated tones
yes what saphira asked
we should not be sitting and talking when there is sport to be had
my father eragon exclaimed
it is not morzan it is **
even arya appeared surprised
are you sure eragon how do you know
of course i am ** i will explain later but i could not wait to tell you the truth
roran shook his head
brom
i never would have guessed but i suppose it makes sense
you must be glad to be rid of morzan is name
more than glad eragon said grinning
roran clapped him on the back then said watch yourself eh and trotted after horst and the other villagers
arya moved away in the same direction but before she went more than a few steps eragon called her name and said the cripple who is whole has left du weldenvarden and joined islanzadi at gil ** arya is green eyes widened and her lips parted as if she were about to ask a question
before she could the column of inrushing warriors swept her deeper into the city
blodhgarm sidled closer to eragon
shadeslayer why did the mourning sage leave the forest
he and his companion felt that the time had come to strike against the empire and to reveal their presence to galbatorix
the elf is fur rippled
that is indeed momentous news
eragon climbed back onto saphira
to blodhgarm and his other guards he said work your way up to the keep
we will meet you there
without waiting for the elf to answer saphira jumped onto the stairs leading to the top of the city walls
the stone steps cracked under her weight as she climbed up to the wide parapet from which she took flight over the burning hovels outside feinster flapping quickly to gain altitude
arya will have to give us permission before we can tell anyone else about oromis and glaedr said eragon remembering the oath of secrecy he orik and saphira had sworn to queen islanzadi during their first visit to ellesmera
i am sure she will once she hears our account said saphira
eragon and saphira flew from place to place within feinster landing wherever they spotted a large clump of men or wherever members of the varden appeared beleaguered
unless someone immediately attacked eragon attempted to convince each group of enemies to surrender
he failed as often as he succeeded but he felt better for having tried for many of the men who thronged the streets were ordinary citizens of feinster and not trained soldiers
to each eragon said the empire is our foe not you
do not take up arms against us and you shall have no cause to fear ** the few times eragon saw a woman or child running through the dark city he ordered them to hide in the nearest house and without exception they obeyed
