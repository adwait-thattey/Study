the deep lake kostha merna filled the valley blocking their way
the water gleamed with flickering starlight
the mountain walls restricted passage around kostha merna to a thin strip of shore on either side of the lake both no more than a few steps wide
at the lake is far end a broad sheet of water tumbled down a black cliff into boiling mounds of froth
do we go to the falls asked murtagh tightly
** eragon took the lead and picked his way along the lake is left side
the pebbles underfoot were damp and slime covered
there was barely enough room for saphira between the sheer valley wall and the lake she had to walk with two feet in the water
they were halfway to the waterfall when murtagh warned **
eragon whirled around rocks spraying from under his heel
by the shore of kostha merna where they had been only minutes before hulking figures streamed out of the forest
the urgals massed before the lake
one of them gestured at saphira guttural words drifted over the water
immediately the horde split and started around both sides of the lake leaving eragon and murtagh without an escape route
the narrow shore forced the bulky kull to march single file
** barked murtagh drawing his sword and slapping the horses on their flanks
saphira took off without warning and wheeled back toward the urgals
** cried eragon shouting with his mind come ** but she continued heedless to his pleas
with an agonizing effort he tore his gaze from her and plunged forward wrenching zar roc from its sheath
saphira dived at the urgals bellowing fiercely
they tried to scatter but were trapped against the mountainside
she caught a kull between her talons and carried the screaming creature aloft tearing at him with her fangs
the silent body crashed into the lake a moment later an arm and a leg missing
the kull continued around kostha merna undeterred
with smoke streaming from her nostrils saphira dived at them again
she twisted and rolled as a cloud of black arrows shot toward her
most of the darts glanced off her scaled sides leaving no more than bruises but she roared as the rest pierced her wings
eragon is arms twinged with sympathetic pain and he had to restrain himself from rushing to her defense
fear flooded his veins as he saw the line of urgals closing in on them
he tried to run faster but his muscles were too tired the rocks too slippery
then with a loud splash saphira plunged into kostha merna
she submerged completely sending ripples across the lake
the urgals nervously eyed the dark water lapping their feet
one growled something indecipherable and jabbed his spear at the lake
the water exploded as saphira is head shot out of the depths
her jaws closed on the spear breaking it like a twig as she tore it out of the kull is hands with a vicious twist
before she could seize the urgal himself his companions thrust at her with their spears bloodying her nose
saphira jerked back and hissed angrily beating the water with her tail
keeping his spear pointed at her the lead kull tried to edge past but halted when she snapped at his legs
the string of urgals was forced to stop as she held him at bay
meanwhile the kull on the other side of the lake still hurried toward the falls
i ve trapped them she told eragon tersely but hurry i cannot hold them long
archers on the shore were already taking aim at her
eragon concentrated on going faster but a rock gave under his boot and he pitched forward
murtagh is strong arm kept him on his feet and clasping each other is forearms they urged the horses forward with shouts
they were almost to the waterfall
the noise was overwhelming like an avalanche
a white wall of water gushed down the cliff pounding the rocks below with a fury that sent mist spraying through the air to run down their faces
four yards from the thunderous curtain the beach widened giving them room to maneuver
saphira roared as an urgal spear grazed her haunch then retreated underwater
with her withdrawal the kull rushed forward with long strides
they were only a few hundred feet away
what do we do now murtagh demanded coldly
