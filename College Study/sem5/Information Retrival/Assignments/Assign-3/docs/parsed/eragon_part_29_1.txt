eragon twisted under the blankets reluctant to open his eyes
he dozed then a fuzzy thought entered his mind
how did i get here confused he pulled the blankets tighter and felt something hard on his right arm
he tried to move his wrist
it zinged with ** ** he bolted upright
he lay in a small clearing that was empty save a small campfire heating a stew filled pot
a squirrel chattered on a branch
his bow and quiver rested alongside the blankets
attempting to stand made him grimace as his muscles were feeble and sore
there was a heavy splint on his bruised right arm
where is everyone he wondered forlornly
he tried to call saphira but to his alarm could not feel her
ravenous hunger gripped him so he ate the stew
still hungry he looked for the saddlebags hoping to find a chunk of bread
neither the saddlebags nor the horses were in the ** am sure there is a good reason for this he thought suppressing a surge of uneasiness
he wandered about the clearing then returned to his blankets and rolled them up
without anything better to do he sat against a tree and watched the clouds overhead
hours passed but brom and saphira did not show ** hope nothing is wrong
as the afternoon dragged on eragon grew bored and started to explore the surrounding forest
when he became tired he rested under a fir tree that leaned against a boulder with a bowl shaped depression filled with clear dew water
eragon stared at the water and thought about brom is instructions for ** i can see where saphira is
brom said that scrying takes a lot of energy but i am stronger than he is
he breathed deeply and closed his eyes
in his mind he formed a picture of saphira making it as lifelike as possible
it was more demanding than he expected
then he said draumr ** and gazed at the water
its surface became completely flat frozen by an invisible force
the reflections disappeared and the water became clear
on it shimmered an image of saphira
her surroundings were pure white but eragon could see that she was flying
brom sat on her back beard streaming sword on his knees
eragon tiredly let the image ** least they re safe
he gave himself a few minutes to recuperate then leaned back over the ** how are you in his mind he saw his cousin clearly
impulsively he drew upon the magic and uttered the words
the water grew still then the image formed on its surface
roran appeared sitting on an invisible chair
like saphira his surroundings were white
there were new lines on roran is face he looked more like garrow than ever before
eragon held the image in place as long as he ** roran in therinsford he is certainly nowhere i ve been
the strain of using magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead
he sighed and for a long time was content just to sit
then an absurd notion struck ** if i tried to scry something i created with my imagination or saw in a dream he ** i d be shown what my own consciousness looks like
it was too tempting an idea to pass by
he knelt by the water once ** shall i look for he considered a few things but discarded them all when he remembered his dream about the woman in the cell
after fixing the scene in his mind he spoke the words and watched the water intently
he waited but nothing happened
disappointed he was about to release the magic when inky blackness swirled across the water covering the surface
the image of a lone candle flickered in the darkness brightening to illuminate a stone cell
the woman from his dream was curled up on a cot in one corner
she lifted her head dark hair falling back and stared directly at eragon
he froze the force of her gaze keeping him in place
chills ran up his spine as their eyes locked
then the woman trembled and collapsed limply
the water cleared
eragon rocked back on his heels gasping
this can not ** she should not be real i only dreamed about ** how could she know i was looking at her and how could i have scryed into a dungeon that i ve never seen he shook his head wondering if any of his other dreams had been visions
the rhythmic thump of saphira is wings interrupted his thoughts
he hurried back to the clearing arriving just as saphira landed
