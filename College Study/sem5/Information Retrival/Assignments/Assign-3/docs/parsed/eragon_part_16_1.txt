dreams roiled in eragon is mind breeding and living by their own ** watched as a group of people on proud horses approached a lonely river
many had silver hair and carried tall lances
a strange fair ship waited for them shining under a bright moon
the figures slowly boarded the vessel two of them taller than the rest walked arm in arm
their faces were obscured by cowls but he could tell that one was a woman
they stood on the deck of the ship and faced the shore
a man stood alone on the pebble beach the only one who had not boarded the ship
he threw back his head and let out a long aching cry
as it faded the ship glided down the river without a breeze or oars out into the flat empty land
the vision clouded but just before it disappeared eragon glimpsed two dragons in the sky
eragon was first aware of the creaking back and forth back and forth
the persistent sound made him open his eyes and stare at the underside of a thatched roof
a rough blanket was draped over him concealing his nakedness
someone had bandaged his legs and tied a clean rag around his knuckles
he was in a single room hut
a mortar and pestle sat on a table with bowls and plants
rows of dried herbs hung from the walls and suffused the air with strong earthy aromas
flames writhed inside a fireplace before which sat a rotund woman in a wicker rocking chair the town healer gertrude
her head lolled eyes closed
a pair of knitting needles and a ball of wool thread rested in her lap
though eragon felt drained of willpower he made himself sit up
that helped to clear his mind
he sifted through his memories of the last two days
his first thought was of garrow and his second was of ** hope she is in a safe place
he tried to contact her but could not
wherever she was it was far from ** least brom got me to carvahall
i wonder what happened to him there was all that blood
gertrude stirred and opened her sparkling eyes
oh she said
you re awake
** her voice was rich and warm
how do you feel
gertrude dragged the chair close to the bed
over at horst is
there was not enough room to keep both of you here
and let me tell you it is kept me on my toes having to run back and forth checking to see if the two of you were all right
eragon swallowed his worries and asked how is he
there was a long delay as she examined her hands
not good
he has a fever that refuses to break and his injuries are not healing
i have to see ** he tried to get up
not until you eat she said sharply pushing him down
i did not spend all this time sitting by your side so you can get back up and hurt yourself
half the skin on your legs was torn off and your fever broke only last night
do not worry yourself about garrow
he will be fine
he is a tough ** gertrude hung a kettle over the fire then began chopping parsnips for soup
how long have i been here
two ** meant his last meal had been four mornings ** just thinking about it made eragon feel ** is been on her own this entire time i hope she is all right
the whole town wants to know what happened
they sent men down to your farm and found it ** eragon nodded he had expected that
your barn was burned down
is that how garrow was injured
i
i do not know said eragon
i was not there when it happened
well no matter
i am sure it will all get ** gertrude resumed knitting while the soup cooked
that is quite a scar on your palm
he reflexively clenched his hand
yes
several possible answers came to mind
he chose the simplest one
i ve had it ever since i can remember
i never asked garrow where it came from
** the silence remained unbroken until the soup reached a rolling boil
gertrude poured it in a bowl and handed it to eragon with a spoon
he accepted it gratefully and took a cautious sip
it was delicious
when he finished he asked can i visit garrow now
gertrude sighed
you re a determined one are not you well if you really want to i wo not stop you
put on your clothes and we will go
she turned her back as he struggled into his pants wincing as they dragged over the bandages and then slipped on his shirt
gertrude helped him stand
his legs were weak but they did not pain him like before
