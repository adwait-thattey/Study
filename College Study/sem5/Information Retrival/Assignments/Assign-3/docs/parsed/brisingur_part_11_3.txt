he twisted nearly in half as he rolled away from where he had been lying
scrabbling backward he pushed himself to his feet and raised his arms in front of himself to deflect oncoming blows
the dark of night surrounded him
above the impartial stars continued to gyrate in their endless celestial dance
below not a creature stirred nor could he hear anything but the gentle wind caressing the grass
eragon stabbed outward with his mind convinced that someone was about to attack him
he extended himself over a thousand feet in every direction but found no one else in the vicinity
at last he lowered his hands
his chest heaved and his skin burned and he stank of sweat
in his mind a tempest roared a whirlwind of flashing blades and severed limbs
for a moment he thought he was in farthen dur fighting the urgals and then on the burning plains crossing swords with men like himself
each location was so real he would have sworn some strange magic had transported him backward through space and time
he saw standing before him the men and the urgals whom he had slain they appeared so real he wondered if they would speak
and while he no longer bore the scars of his wounds his body remembered the many injuries he had suffered and he shuddered as he again felt swords and arrows piercing his flesh
with a shapeless howl eragon fell to his knees and wrapped his arms around his stomach hugging himself as he rocked back and forth
it is all right
it is all right
he pressed his forehead against the ground curling into a hard tight ball
his breath was hot against his belly
none of the epics brom had recited in carvahall mentioned that such visions had bedeviled the heroes of old
none of the warriors eragon had met in the varden seemed troubled by the blood they shed
and even though roran admitted he disliked killing he did not wake up screaming in the middle of the night
i am weak thought eragon
a man should not feel like this
a rider should not feel like this
garrow or brom would have been fine i know
they did what needed to be done and that was that
no crying about it no endless worrying or gnashing of teeth
i am weak
jumping up he paced around his nest in the grass trying to calm himself
after half an hour when apprehension still clenched his chest in an iron grip and his skin itched as if a thousand ants crawled underneath it and he started at the slightest noise eragon grabbed his pack and set off at a dead run
he cared not what lay before him in the unknown darkness nor who might notice his headlong flight
he only sought to escape his nightmares
his mind had turned against him and he could not rely upon rational thought to dispel his panic
his one recourse then was to trust in the ancient animal wisdom of his flesh which told him to move
if he ran fast and hard enough perhaps he could anchor himself in the moment
perhaps the thrashing of his arms the thudding of his feet on dirt the slick chill of sweat under his arms and a myriad of other sensations would by their sheer weight and number force him to forget
eragon squinted at them
in palancar valley when the starlings returned after winter they often formed groups so large they transformed day into night
this flock was not that large yet it reminded him of evenings spent drinking mint tea with garrow and roran on the porch of their house watching a rustling black cloud turn and twist overhead
lost in memory he stopped and sat on a rock so he could retie the laces on his boots
the weather had changed it was cool now and a gray smudge to the west hinted at the possibility of a storm
the vegetation was lusher with moss and reeds and thick clumps of green grass
several miles away five hills dotted the otherwise smooth land
a stand of thick oak trees adorned the central hill
above the hazy mounds of foliage eragon glimpsed the crumbling walls of a long abandoned building constructed by some race in ages past
curiosity aroused he decided to break his fast among the ruins
they were sure to contain plentiful game and foraging would provide him with an excuse to do a bit of exploring before continuing on his way
