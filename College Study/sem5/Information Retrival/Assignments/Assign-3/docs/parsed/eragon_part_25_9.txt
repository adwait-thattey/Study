brom sighed
he went to his nightstand and dipped his fingers in a basin of rose water
galbatorix wants your willing cooperation
without that you re worse than useless to him
so the question becomes if you are ever faced with this choice are you willing to die for what you believe in for that is the only way you will deny him
the question hung in the air
brom finally said it is a difficult question and not one you can answer until you re faced with it
keep in mind that many people have died for their beliefs it is actually quite common
the real courage is in living and suffering for what you believe
it was late in the morning when eragon woke
he dressed washed his face in the basin then held the mirror up and brushed his hair into place
something about his reflection made him stop and look closer
his face had changed since he had run out of carvahall just a short while ago
any baby fat was gone now stripped away by traveling sparring and training
his cheekbones were more prominent and the line of his jaw was sharper
there was a slight cast to his eyes that when he looked closely gave his face a wild alien appearance
he held the mirror at arm is length and his face resumed its normal semblance but it still did not seem quite his own
a little disturbed he slung his bow and quiver across his back then left the room
before he had reached the end of the hall the butler caught up with him and said sir neal left with my master for the castle earlier
he said that you could do whatever you want today because he will not return until this evening
eragon thanked him for the message then eagerly began exploring teirm
for hours he wandered the streets entering every shop that struck his fancy and chatting with various people
eventually he was forced back to jeod is by his empty stomach and lack of money
when he reached the street where the merchant lived he stopped at the herbalist is shop next door
it was an unusual place for a store
the other shops were down by the city wall not crammed between expensive houses
he tried to look in the windows but they were covered with a thick layer of crawling plants on the interior
curious he went inside
at first he saw nothing because the store was so dark but then his eyes adjusted to the faint greenish light that filtered through the windows
a colorful bird with wide tail feathers and a sharp powerful beak looked at eragon inquisitively from a cage near the window
the walls were covered with plants vines clung to the ceiling obscuring all but an old chandelier and on the floor was a large pot with a yellow flower
a collection of mortars pestles metal bowls and a clear crystal ball the size of eragon is head rested on a long counter
he walked to the counter carefully stepping around complex machines crates of rocks piles of scrolls and other objects he did not recognize
the wall behind the counter was covered with drawers of every size
some of them were no larger than his smallest finger while others were big enough for a barrel
there was a foot wide gap in the shelves far above
a pair of red eyes suddenly flashed from the dark space and a large fierce cat leapt onto the counter
it had a lean body with powerful shoulders and oversized paws
a shaggy mane surrounded its angular face its ears were tipped with black tufts
white fangs curved down over its jaw
altogether it did not look like any cat eragon had ever seen
it inspected him with shrewd eyes then flicked its tail dismissively
on a whim eragon reached out with his mind and touched the cat is consciousness
gently he prodded it with his thoughts trying to make it understand that he was a friend
you do not have to do that
eragon looked around in alarm
the cat ignored him and licked a ** where are you he asked
no one answered
puzzled he leaned against the counter and reached for what looked like a wood rod
stop playing games saphira he snapped then picked up the rod
a shock of electricity exploded through his body and he fell to the floor writhing
the pain slowly faded leaving him gasping for air
the cat jumped down and looked at him
