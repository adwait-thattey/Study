he was as gentle as possible unlike the twins who had ravaged his own mind in a similar procedure the day he arrived at farthen dur
roran stood guard pacing back and forth in front of the open doorway
every second that went by increased his agitation he twirled his hammer and tapped the head of it against his upper thigh as if keeping time with a piece of music
at last eragon released katrina
i am done
what did you find she whispered
she hugged herself her forehead creased with worry lines as she waited for his verdict
silence filled the cell as roran came to a standstill
nothing but your own thoughts
you are free of any spells
of course she is growled roran and again wrapped her in his arms
together the three of them exited the cell
brisingr iet tauthr said eragon gesturing at the werelight that still floated near the ceiling of the hallway
at his command the glowing orb darted to a spot directly over his head and remained there bobbing like a piece of driftwood in the surf
eragon took the lead as they hurried back through the jumble of tunnels toward the cavern where they had landed
as he trotted across the slick rock he watched for the remaining ra zac while at the same time erecting wards to safeguard katrina
behind him he heard her and roran exchange a series of brief phrases and lone words i love you
horst and others safe
always
for you
yes
yes
yes
** the trust and affection they shared were so obvious it roused a dull ache of longing inside eragon
when they were about ten yards from the main cavern and could just begin to see by the faint glow ahead of them eragon extinguished the werelight
a few feet later katrina slowed then pressed herself against the side of the tunnel and covered her face
i can not
it is too bright my eyes hurt
roran quickly moved in front of her casting her in his shadow
when was the last time you were outside
i do not know
a hint of panic crept into her voice
i do not ** not since they brought me here
roran am i going blind she sniffed and began to cry
her tears surprised eragon
he remembered her as someone of great strength and fortitude
but then she had spent many weeks locked in the dark fearing for her life
i might not be myself either if i were in her place
no you re fine
you just need to get used to the sun ** roran stroked her hair
come on do not let this upset you
everything is going to be all right
you re safe now
safe katrina
you hear me
although he hated to ruin one of the tunics the elves had given him eragon tore off a strip of cloth from the bottom edge of his garment
he handed it to katrina and said tie this over your eyes
you should be able to see through it well enough to keep from falling or running into anything
she thanked him and then blindfolded herself
once again advancing the trio emerged into the sunny bloodsplattered main cavern which stank worse than before owing to the noxious fumes that drifted from the body of the lethrblaka even as saphira appeared from within the depths of the lancet opening opposite them
seeing her katrina gasped and clung to roran digging her fingers into his arms
eragon said katrina allow me to introduce you to saphira
i am her rider
she can understand if you speak to her
it is an honor o dragon katrina managed to say
she dipped her knees in a weak imitation of a curtsy
saphira inclined her head in return
then she faced eragon
i searched the lethrblaka is nest but all i found was bones bones and more bones including several that smelled of fresh meat
the ra zac must have eaten the slaves last night
i wish we could have rescued them
i know but we cannot protect everyone in this war
gesturing at saphira eragon said go on climb onto her
i will join you in a moment
katrina hesitated then glanced at roran who nodded and murmured it is all right
saphira brought us ** together the couple skirted the corpse of the lethrblaka as they went over to saphira who crouched flat upon her belly so that they could mount her
cupping his hands to form a step roran lifted katrina high enough to pull herself over the upper part of saphira is left foreleg
