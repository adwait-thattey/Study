the dragon was no longer than his forearm yet it was dignified and noble
its scales were deep sapphire blue the same color as the stone
but not a stone he realized an egg
the dragon fanned its wings they were what had made it appear so contorted
the wings were several times longer than its body and ribbed with thin fingers of bone that extended from the wing is front edge forming a line of widely spaced talons
the dragon is head was roughly triangular
two diminutive white fangs curved down out of its upper jaw
they looked very sharp
its claws were also white like polished ivory and slightly serrated on the inside curve
a line of small spikes ran down the creature is spine from the base of its head to the tip of its tail
a hollow where its neck and shoulders joined created a larger than normal gap between the spikes
eragon shifted slightly and the dragon is head snapped around
hard ice blue eyes fixed on him
he kept very still
it might be a formidable enemy if it decided to attack
the dragon lost interest in eragon and awkwardly explored the room squealing as it bumped into a wall or furniture
with a flutter of wings it leapt onto the bed and crawled to his pillow squeaking
its mouth was open pitifully like a young bird is displaying rows of pointed teeth
eragon sat cautiously on the end of the bed
the dragon smelled his hand nibbled his sleeve
he pulled his arm back
a smile tugged at eragon is lips as he looked at the small creature
tentatively he reached out with his right hand and touched its flank
a blast of icy energy surged into his hand and raced up his arm burning in his veins like liquid fire
he fell back with a wild cry
an iron clang filled his ears and he heard a soundless scream of rage
every part of his body seared with pain
he struggled to move but was unable to
after what seemed like hours warmth seeped back into his limbs leaving them tingling
shivering uncontrollably he pushed himself upright
his hand was numb his fingers paralyzed
alarmed he watched as the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffused white oval
the skin itched and burned like a spider bite
his heart pounded frantically
eragon blinked trying to understand what had occurred
something brushed against his consciousness like a finger trailing over his skin
he felt it again but this time it solidified into a tendril of thought through which he could feel a growing curiosity
it was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had fallen away and he was now free to reach out with his mind
he was afraid that without anything to hold him back he would float out of his body and be unable to return becoming a spirit of the ether
scared he pulled away from the contact
the new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes
he glared suspiciously at the motionless dragon
a scaly leg scraped against his side and he jerked back
but the energy did not shock him again
puzzled he rubbed the dragon is head with his right hand
a light tingling ran up his arm
the dragon nuzzled him arching its back like a cat
he slid a finger over its thin wing membranes
they felt like old parchment velvety and warm but still slightly damp
hundreds of slender veins pulsed through them
again the tendril touched his mind but this time instead of curiosity he sensed an overpowering ravenous hunger
he got up with a sigh
this was a dangerous animal of that he was sure
yet it seemed so helpless crawling on his bed he could only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it
the dragon wailed in a reedy tone as it looked for food
eragon quickly scratched its head to keep it ** will think about this later he decided and left the room carefully closing the door
returning with two strips of dried meat he found the dragon sitting on the windowsill watching the moon
he cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the dragon
it smelled the square cautiously then jabbed its head forward like a snake and snatched the meat from his fingers swallowing it whole with a peculiar jerk
the dragon prodded eragon is hand for more food
he fed it careful to keep his fingers out of the way
