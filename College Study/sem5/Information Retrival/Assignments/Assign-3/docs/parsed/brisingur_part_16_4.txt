blodhgarm is musk surrounded him like a cloud thick and heady a warm smoky scent that contained hints of crushed juniper berries and that set saphira is nostrils to tingling
all the women in the varden seem to have fallen in love with him she said
they stalk him wherever he goes desperate to talk with him but too shy to utter so much as a squeak when he looks at them
maybe only females can smell him
he cast a concerned glance at arya
she does not seem to be affected
she has protection against magical influences
i hope so
do you think we should put a stop to blodhgarm
what he is doing is a sneaky underhanded way of gaining a woman is heart
is it any more underhanded than adorning yourself with fine clothing to catch the eye of your beloved blodhgarm has not taken advantage of the women who are fascinated by him and it seems improbable that he would have composed the notes of his scent to appeal specifically to human women
rather i would guess it is an unintended consequence and that he created it to serve another purpose altogether
unless he discards all semblance of decency i think we should refrain from interfering
what about nasuada is she vulnerable to his charms
nasuada is wise and wary
she had trianna place a ward around her that protects her against blodhgarm is influence
when they arrived at the tents the crowd swelled in size until half the varden appeared to be gathered around saphira
eragon raised his hand in response as people shouted ** and ** and he heard others say where have you been shadeslayer tell us of your ** a fair number referred to him as the bane of the ra zac which he found so immensely satisfying he repeated the phrase four times to himself under his breath
people also shouted blessings upon his health and saphira is too and invitations to dine and offers of gold and jewelry and piteous requests for aid would he please heal a son who had been born blind or would he remove a growth that was killing a man is wife or would he fix a horse is broken leg or repair a bent sword for as the man bellowed it was my grandfather ** twice a woman is voice cried out shadeslayer will you marry me and while he looked he was unable to identify the source
throughout the commotion the twelve elves hovered close
the knowledge that they were watching for that which he could not see and listening for that which he could not hear was a comfort to eragon and allowed him to interact with the massed varden with an ease that had escaped him in the past
then from between the curving rows of woolen tents the former villagers of carvahall began to appear
dismounting eragon walked among the friends and acquaintances of his childhood shaking hands slapping shoulders and laughing at jokes that would be incomprehensible to anyone who had not grown up around carvahall
horst was there and eragon grasped the smith is brawny forearm
welcome back eragon
well done
we re in your debt for avenging us on the monsters that drove us from our homes
i am glad to see you are still in one piece eh
the ra zac would have had to move a sight faster to chop any parts off of ** said eragon
then he found himself greeting horst is sons albriech and baldor and then loring the shoemaker and his three sons tara and morn who had owned carvahall is tavern fisk felda calitha delwin and lenna and then fierce eyed birgit who said i thank you eragon son of none
i thank you for ensuring that the creatures who ate my husband were properly punished
my hearth is yours now and forever
before eragon could respond the crowd swept them apart
son of none he thought
** i have a father and everyone hates him
then to his delight roran shouldered his way out of the throng katrina beside him
he and roran embraced and roran growled that was a fool thing to do staying behind
i ought to knock your block off for abandoning us like that
next time give me advance warning before you traipse off on your own
it is getting to be a habit with you
and you should have seen how upset saphira was on the flight back
eragon put a hand on saphira is left foreleg and said i am sorry i could not tell you beforehand that i planned to stay but i did not realize it was necessary until the very last moment
