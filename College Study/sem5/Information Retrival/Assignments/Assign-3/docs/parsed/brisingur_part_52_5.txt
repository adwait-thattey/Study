when oromis had finished teaching him how to shift objects the elf asked since you have declined lord fiolr is offer of tamerlein will you and saphira stay in ellesmera much longer
i do not know master replied eragon
there is something more i wish to try with the menoa tree but if it does not succeed then i suppose we will have no choice but to depart for the varden empty handed
oromis nodded
before you leave return here with saphira one last time
it will work because it must
besides do you have a better idea
no but i like it not
we do not know how she might react
remember before linnea sang herself into the tree she killed the young man who betrayed her affections
she might resort to violence again
she wo not dare not while you are there to protect me
with a faint whisper of wind saphira alighted upon a knuckle like root several hundred feet from the base of the menoa tree
the squirrels in the enormous pine screamed warnings to their brethren as they noticed her arrival
sliding down onto the root eragon rubbed his palms on his thighs then muttered right let is not waste ** with light footsteps he ran up the root to the trunk of the tree holding his arms out on either side to maintain his balance
saphira followed at a slower pace her claws splitting and cracking the bark she trod over
eragon squatted on a slippery patch of wood and hooked his fingers through a crevice in the trunk of the tree in order to keep himself from toppling over
he waited until saphira was standing above him and then he closed his eyes breathed deeply of the cool moist air and pushed his thoughts out toward the tree
the menoa tree made no attempt to stop him from touching her mind for her consciousness was so large and alien and so intertwined with that of the other plant life of the forest it did not need to defend itself
anyone who attempted to seize control of the tree would also have to establish their mental dominance over a large swath of du weldenvarden a feat which no single person could hope to achieve
from the tree eragon felt a sense of warmth and light and of the earth pressing against her roots for hundreds of yards in every direction
he felt the stir of a breeze through the tree is tangled branches and the flow of sticky sap seeping over a small cut in its bark and he received a host of similar impressions from the other plants the menoa tree watched over
compared with the awareness it had displayed during the blood oath celebration the tree almost seemed to be asleep the only sentient thought eragon could detect was so long and slow moving it was impossible to decipher
summoning all of his resources eragon flung a mental shout at the menoa tree
please listen to me o great ** i need your ** the entire land is at war the elves have left the safety of du weldenvarden and i do not have a sword to fight ** the werecat solembum told me to look under the menoa tree when i needed a weapon
well that time has ** please listen to me o mother of the ** help me in my ** while he spoke eragon pressed against the tree is consciousness images of thorn and murtagh and the armies of the empire
adding several more memories to the mix saphira bolstered his efforts with the force of her own mind
eragon did not rely on words and images alone
from within himself and saphira he funneled a steady stream of energy into the tree a gift of good faith that he hoped might also rouse the menoa tree is curiosity
several minutes elapsed and still the tree did not acknowledge them but eragon refused to abandon their attempt
the tree he reasoned moved at a slower pace than humans or elves it was only to be expected that it would not immediately respond to their request
we cannot spare much more of our strength said saphira not if we are to return to the varden in a timely fashion
eragon agreed and reluctantly stemmed the flow of energy
while they continued to plead with the menoa tree the sun reached its zenith and then began to descend
clouds billowed and shrank and scuttled across the dome of the sky
birds darted over the trees angry squirrels chattered butterflies meandered from spot to spot and a line of red ants marched past eragon is boot carrying small white larvae in their pincers
