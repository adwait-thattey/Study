sometimes said saphira gently there are no answers
learn what you can about murtagh from this
then forgive him
and if you can not forgive at least forget for he meant you no harm however rash the act was
your head is still attached yes
frowning eragon shifted in the saddle
he shook himself like a horse trying to rid itself of a fly and checked murtagh is position over saphira is shoulder
a patch of color farther back along their route caught his attention
camped by a streambed they had crossed late yesterday were the urgals
eragon is heartbeat quickened
how could the urgals be on foot yet still gain on them saphira saw the monsters as well and tilted her wings brought them close to her body and slipped into a steep dive splitting the ** do not think they spotted us she said
eragon hoped not
he squinted against the blast of air as she increased the angle of their ** chieftain must be driving them at a breakneck pace he said
yes maybe they will all die of exhaustion
when they landed murtagh asked curtly what now
the urgals are overtaking us said eragon
he pointed back toward the column is camp
how far do we still have to go asked murtagh putting his hands against the sky and measuring the hours until sunset
normally
i would guess another five days
at the speed we ve been traveling only three
but unless we get there tomorrow the urgals will probably catch us and arya will certainly die
we can not count on it objected eragon
the only way we can get to the varden in time is if we do not stop for anything least of all sleep
that is our only chance
murtagh laughed bitterly
how can you expect to do that we ve already gone days without adequate sleep
unless riders are made of different stuff than us mortals you re as tired as i am
we ve covered a staggering distance and the horses in case you have not noticed are ready to drop
another day of this might kill us all
eragon shrugged
so be it
we do not have a choice
murtagh gazed at the mountains
i could leave and let you fly ahead with saphira
that would force the urgals to divide their troops and would give you a better chance of reaching the varden
it would be suicide said eragon crossing his arms
somehow those urgals are faster on foot than we are on horseback
they would run you down like a deer
the only way to evade them is to find sanctuary with the ** despite his words he was unsure if he wanted murtagh to ** like him eragon confessed to himself but i am no longer certain if that is a good thing
i will escape later said murtagh abruptly
when we get to the varden i can disappear down a side valley and find my way to surda where i can hide without attracting too much attention
sleep or no sleep i will see you to the varden promised murtagh
with newfound determination they struggled to distance themselves from the urgals yet their pursuers continued to creep nearer
at nightfall the monsters were a third closer than they had been that morning
as fatigue eroded his and murtagh is strength they slept in turns on the horses while whoever was awake led the animals in the right direction
eragon relied heavily on arya is memories to guide them
because of the alien nature of her mind he sometimes made mistakes as to the route costing them precious time
they gradually angled toward the foothills of the eastern arm of mountains looking for the valley that would lead them to the varden
midnight arrived and passed without any sign of it
when the sun returned they were pleased to see that the urgals were far behind
this is the last day said eragon yawning widely
if we re not reasonably close to the varden by noon i am going to fly ahead with arya
you will be free to go wherever you want then but you will have to take snowfire with you
i wo not be able to come back for him
that might not be necessary we could still get there in time said murtagh
he rubbed the pommel of his sword
eragon shrugged
we ** he went to arya and put a hand on her forehead
it was damp and dangerously hot
her eyes wandered uneasily beneath her eyelids as if she suffered a nightmare
eragon pressed a damp rag to her brow wishing he could do more
