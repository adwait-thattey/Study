when eragon woke his eyes were gritty his body stiff
the cave was empty except for the horses
the litter was gone no sign of brom remained
he walked to the entrance and sat on the pitted ** the witch angela was correct there was a death in my future he thought staring bleakly at the land
the topaz sun brought a desert heat to the early morning
a tear slid down his listless face and evaporated in the sunlight leaving a salty crust on his skin
he closed his eyes and absorbed the warmth emptying his mind
with a fingernail he aimlessly scratched the sandstone
when he looked he saw that he had writtenwhy me
he was still there when murtagh climbed up to the cave carrying a pair of rabbits
without a word he seated himself by eragon
how are you he asked
murtagh considered him thoughtfully
will you recover eragon shrugged
after a few minutes of reflection murtagh said i dislike asking this at such a time but i must know
is your bromthe brom the one who helped steal a dragon egg from the king chased it across the empire and killed morzan in a duel i heard you say his name and i read the inscription you put on his grave but i must know for certain was that he
it was said eragon softly
a troubled expression settled on murtagh is face
how do you know all that you talk about things that are secret to most and you were trailing the ra zac right when we needed help
are you one of the varden
murtagh is eyes became inscrutable orbs
i am running away like ** there was restrained sorrow in his words
i do not belong to either the varden or the empire
nor do i owe allegiance to any man but myself
as for my rescuing you i will admit that i ve heard whispered tales of a new rider and reasoned that by following the ra zac i might discover if they were true
i thought you wanted to kill the ra zac said eragon
murtagh smiled grimly
i do but if i had i never would have met you
but brom would still be alive
i wish he were here
he would know whether to trust ** remembered how brom had sensed trevor is intentions in daret and wondered if he could do the same with murtagh
he reached for murtagh is consciousness but his probe abruptly ran into an iron hard wall which he tried to circumvent
murtagh is entire mind was ** did he learn to do that brom said that few people if any could keep others out of their mind without training
so who is murtagh to have this ability pensive and lonely eragon asked where is saphira
i do not know said murtagh
she followed me for a time when i went hunting then flew off on her own
i have not seen her since before ** eragon rocked onto his feet and returned to the cave
murtagh followed
what are you going to do now
i am not ** and i do not want to think about it either
he rolled up his blankets and tied them to cadoc is saddlebags
his ribs hurt
murtagh went to prepare the rabbits
as eragon shifted things in his bags he uncovered zar roc
the red sheath glinted brightly
he took out the sword
weighed it in his hands
he had never carried zar roc nor used it in combat except when he and brom had sparred because he had not wanted people to see it
that concerned eragon no more
the ra zac had seemed surprised and frightened by the sword that was more than enough reason for him to wear it
with a shudder he pulled off his bow and belted on zar ** this moment on i will live by the sword
let the whole world see what i am
i have no fear
i am a rider now fully and completely
he sorted through brom is bags but found only clothes a few odd items and a small pouch of coins
eragon took the map of alagaesia and put the bags away then crouched by the fire
murtagh is eyes narrowed as he looked up from the rabbit he was skinning
that sword
may i see it he asked wiping his hands
eragon hesitated reluctant to relinquish the weapon for even a moment then nodded
murtagh examined the symbol on the blade intently
his face darkened
where did you get this
brom gave it to me
why
murtagh shoved the sword back and crossed his arms angrily
he was breathing hard
that sword he said with emotion was once as well known as its owner
the last rider to carry it was morzan a brutal savage man
