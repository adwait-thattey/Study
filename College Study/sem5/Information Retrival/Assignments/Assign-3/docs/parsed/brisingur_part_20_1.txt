along with angela eragon made his apologies for their tardiness and then he listened as nasuada explained to elva the value of her abilities to the varden as if she does not already know eragon commented to saphira and entreated her to release eragon from his promise to try to undo the effects of his blessing
she said she understood that what she was asking of elva was difficult but the fate of the entire land was at stake and was it not worth sacrificing one is own comfort to help rescue alagaesia from galbatorix is evil clutches it was a magnificent speech eloquent impassioned and full of arguments intended to appeal to elva is more noble sentiments
elva who had been resting her small pointed chin on her fists raised her head and said ** shocked silence pervaded the pavilion
transferring her unblinking gaze from one person to the next she elaborated eragon angela you both know what it is like to share someone is thoughts and emotions as they die
you know how horrible how wrenching it is how it feels as if part of yourself has vanished forever
and that is only from the death of one person
neither of you has to endure the experience unless you want to whereas i
i have no choice but to share them all
i feel every death around me
even now i can feel the life ebbing out of sefton one of your swordsmen nasuada who was wounded on the burning plains and i know what words i could say to him that would lessen his terror of obliteration
his fear is so great oh it makes me ** with an incoherent cry she cast up her arms before her face as if to ward off a blow
then ah he has gone
but there are others
there are always others
the line of dead never ** the bitter mocking quality of her voice intensified a travesty of a child is normal speech
do you truly understand nasuada lady nightstalker
she who would be queen of the world do you truly understand i am privy to all of the agony around me whether physical or mental
i feel it as if it were my own and eragon is magic drives me to alleviate the discomfort of those who suffer regardless of the cost to myself
and if i resist the urge as i am this very moment my body rebels against me my stomach turns acid my head throbs as if a dwarf is hammering on it and i find it hard to move much less think
is this what you would wish on me nasuada
night and day i have no respite from the pain of the world
since eragon blessed me i have known nothing but hurt and fear never happiness or pleasure
the lighter side of life the things that make this existence bearable these are denied me
never do i see them
never do i share in them
only darkness
only the combined misery of all the men women and children within a mile battering at me like a midnight storm
this blessing has deprived me of the opportunity to be like other children
it has forced my body to mature faster than normal and my mind even faster still
eragon may be able to remove this ghastly ability of mine and the compulsion that accompanies it but he cannot return me to what i was nor what i should be not without destroying who i have become
i am a freak neither a child nor an adult forever doomed to stand apart
i am not blind you know
i see how you recoil when you hear me ** she shook her head
no this is too much to ask of me
i will not continue like this for the sake of you nasuada nor the varden nor the whole of alagaesia nor even for my dear mother were she still alive today
it is not worth it not for anything
i could go live by myself so that i would be free of other people is afflictions but i do not want to live like that
no the only solution is for eragon to attempt to correct his ** her lips curved in a sly smile
and if you disagree with me if you think i am being stupid and selfish why then you would do well to remember that i am hardly more than a swaddling babe and have yet to celebrate my second birthday
only fools expect an infant to martyr herself for the greater good
but infant or not i have made my decision and nothing you can say will convince me otherwise
in this i am as iron
