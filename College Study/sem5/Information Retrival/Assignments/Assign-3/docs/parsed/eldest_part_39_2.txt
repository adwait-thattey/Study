the wide membrane became translucent whenever lightning pulsed in jagged shards of light
what time do you think it is
several hours before we must meet oromis
go on sleep and recover
i will keep guard
he did just that despite the tree is churning
oromis is timepiece buzzed like a giant hornet blaring in eragon is ears until he retrieved the bauble and wound the mechanism
his bashed knee had turned purple he was sore both from his attack and the elves dance of snake and crane and he could do no more than croak with his ragged throat
the worst injury though was his sense of foreboding that this would not be the last time durza is wound would trouble him
the prospect sickened him draining his strength and will
so many weeks passed between attacks he said i began to hope that maybe just maybe i was healed
i suppose sheer luck is the only reason i was spared that long
extending her neck saphira nuzzled him on the ** know you are not alone little one
i will do everything i can to help
he responded with a weak smile
then she licked his face and added you should get ready to leave
i ** stared at the floor unwilling to move then dragged himself to the wash closet where he scrubbed himself clean and used magic to shave
he was in the middle of drying himself when he felt a presence touch his mind
without pausing to think eragon began to fortify his mind concentrating on an image of his big toe to the exclusion of all else
then he heard oromis say admirable but unnecessary
bring zar roc with you today
the presence vanished
eragon released a shaky ** need to be more alert he told ** would have been at his mercy if he were an enemy
when his ablutions were complete eragon unhooked the membrane from the wall and mounted saphira cradling zar roc in the crook of his arm
saphira took flight with a rush of air angling toward the crags of tel naeir
from their high vantage point they could see the damage that the storm had wreaked on du weldenvarden
no trees had fallen in ellesmera but farther away where the elves magic was weaker numerous pines had been knocked over
the remaining wind made the crossed branches and trees rub together producing a brittle chorus of creaks and groans
clouds of golden pollen as thick as dust streamed out from the trees and flowers
while they flew eragon and saphira exchanged memories of their separate lessons from the day before
he told her what he had learned about ants and the ancient language and she told him about downdrafts and other dangerous weather patterns and how to avoid them
thus when they landed and oromis interrogated eragon about saphira is lessons and glaedr interrogated saphira about eragon is they were able to answer every question
aye
well played bjartskular added glaedr to saphira
as before saphira was sent off with glaedr while eragon remained on the cliffs although this time he and saphira were careful to maintain their link so as to absorb each other is instruction
as the dragons departed oromis observed your voice is rougher today eragon
are you sick
my back hurt again this morning
ah
you have my ** he motioned with one finger
wait here
eragon watched as oromis strode into his hut and then reappeared looking fierce and warlike with his silver mane rippling in the wind and his bronze sword in hand
today he said we shall forgo the rimgar and instead cross our two blades naegling and zar roc
draw thy sword and guard its edge as your first master taught you
eragon wanted nothing more than to refuse
however he had no intention of breaking his vow or letting his resolve waver in front of oromis
he swallowed his ** is what it means to be a rider he thought
drawing upon his reserves he located the nub deep within his mind that connected him to the wild flow of magic
he delved into it and the energy suffused him
geuloth du knifr he said and a winking blue star popped into existence between his thumb and forefinger jumping from one to the next as he ran it down zar roc is perilous length
the instant their swords met eragon knew that he was as out matched by oromis as by durza and arya
