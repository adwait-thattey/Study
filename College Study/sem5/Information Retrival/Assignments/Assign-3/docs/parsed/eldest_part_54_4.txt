his right shoulder burned where the ra zac had bit him but he pressed on
from the porthole where the anchor chain entered the ship he clambered up the ridges that supported the painted figurehead over the railing and onto the deck
uthar was already there dripping and panting
clubs in hand they padded toward the aft of the ship using whatever cover they could find
they stopped not ten feet behind the sentries
the two men leaned on the railing bandying words with birgit
in a flash roran and uthar burst into the open and struck the sentries on the head before they could draw their sabers
below birgit waved for jeod and the rest of their group and between them they raised the gangway and slid one end across to the ship where uthar lashed it to the railing
as nolfavrell ran aboard roran tossed his rope to the boy and said tie and gag these two
then everyone but gertrude descended belowdecks to hunt for the remaining sentries
they found four additional men the purser the bosun the ship is cook and the ship is cook is assistant all of whom were trundled out of bed knocked on the head if they resisted and then securely trussed
in this birgit again proved her worth capturing two men herself
jeod had the unhappy prisoners placed in a line on the deck so they could be watched at all times then declared we have much to do and little time
roran uthar is captain on thedragon wing
you and the others will take your orders from him
for the next two hours the ship was a frenzy of activity
the sailors tended to the rigging and sails while roran and those from carvahall worked to empty the hold of extraneous supplies such as bales of raw wool
these they lowered overboard to prevent anyone on the wharf from hearing a splash
if the entire village was to fit on thedragon wing they needed to clear as much space as possible
roran was in the midst of fitting a cable around a barrel when he heard the hoarse cry someone is ** everyone on deck except jeod and uthar dropped to their bellies and reached for their weapons
the two men who remained standing paced the ship as if they were sentries
roran is heart pounded while he lay motionless wondering what was about to happen
he held his breath as jeod addressed the intruder
then footsteps echoed on the gangway
she wore a plain dress her hair was bound under a kerchief and she carried a burlap sack over one shoulder
she spoke not a word but stowed her gear in the main cabin and returned to stand by jeod
roran thought he had never seen a happier man
the sky above the distant mountains of the spine had just begun to brighten when one of the sailors in the rigging pointed north and whistled to indicate he had spotted the villagers
roran moved even faster
what time they had was now gone
he rushed up on deck and peered at the dark line of people advancing down the coast
this part of their plan depended on the fact that unlike other coastal cities teirm is outer wall had not been left open to the sea but rather completely enclosed the bulk of the city in order to ward off frequent pirate attacks
this meant that the buildings skirting the harbor were left exposed and that the villagers could walk right up to thedragon wing
at uthar is command the sailors brought out armfuls of javelins for the great bows on deck as well as casks of foul smelling tar which they knocked open and used to paint the upper half of the javelins
they then drew and loaded the ballistae on the starboard side it took two men per bow to pull out the sinew cord until it caught on its hook
the villagers were two thirds of the way to the ship before the soldiers patrolling the battlements of teirm spotted them and trumpeted the alarm
even before that first note faded uthar bellowed light and fire **
dashing open jeod is lantern nolfavrell ran from one ballista to the next holding the flame to the javelins until the tar ignited
the instant a missile caught the man behind the bow pulled the release line and the javelin vanished with a heavythunk
in all twelve blazing bolts shot from thedragon wing and pierced the ships and buildings along the bay like roaring red hot meteors from the heavens above
