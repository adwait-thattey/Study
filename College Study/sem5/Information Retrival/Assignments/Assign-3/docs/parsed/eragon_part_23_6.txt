when they reached brom eragon saw him standing in a clearing waving his arms
saphira landed and eragon jumped off her and looked for danger
the horses were tied to a tree on the edge of the clearing but otherwise brom was alone
eragon trotted over and asked what is wrong
brom scratched his chin and muttered a string of curses
do not ever block me out like that again
it is hard enough for me to reach you without having to fight to make myself heard
he snorted
i was farther down the river when i noticed that the ra zac is tracks had ceased
i backtracked until i found where they had disappeared
look at the ground and tell me what you see
eragon knelt and examined the dirt and found a confusion of impressions that were difficult to decipher
numerous ra zac footprints overlapped each other
eragon guessed that the tracks were only a few days old
superimposed over them were long thick gouges torn into the ground
they looked familiar but eragon could not say why
he stood shaking his head
i do not have any idea what
then his eyes fell on saphira and he realized what had made the gouges
every time she took off her back claws dug into the ground and ripped it in the same manner
this does not make any sense but the only thing i can think of is that the ra zac flew off on dragons
or else they got onto giant birds and disappeared into the heavens
tell me you have a better explanation
brom shrugged
i ve heard reports of the ra zac moving from place to place with incredible speed but this is the first evidence i ve had of it
it will be almost impossible to find them if they have flying steeds
they are not dragons i know that much
a dragon would never consent to bear a ra zac
what do we do saphira can not track them through the sky
even if she could we would leave you far behind
there is no easy solution to this riddle said brom
let is have lunch while we think on it
perhaps inspiration will strike us while we ** eragon glumly went to his bags for food
they ate in silence staring at the empty sky
once again eragon thought of home and wondered what roran was doing
a vision of the burnt farm appeared before him and grief threatened to overwhelm ** will i do if we can not find the ra zac what is my purpose then i could return to carvahall he plucked a twig from the ground and snapped it between two fingers or just travel with brom and continue my ** stared out at the plains hoping to quiet his thoughts
when brom finished eating he stood and threw back his hood
i have considered every trick i know every word of power within my grasp and all the skills we have but i still do not see how we can find the ra ** eragon slumped against saphira in despair
saphira could show herself at some town
that would draw the ra zac like flies to honey
but it would be an extremely risky thing to attempt
the ra zac would bring soldiers with them and the king might be interested enough to come himself which would spell certain death for you and me
so what now asked eragon throwing his hands ** you have any ideas saphira
that is up to you said brom
this is your crusade
eragon ground his teeth angrily and stalked away from brom and saphira
just as he was about to enter the trees his foot struck something hard
lying on the ground was a metal flask with a leather strap just long enough to hang off someone is shoulder
a silver insignia eragon recognized as the ra zac is symbol was wrought into it
excited he picked up the flask and unscrewed its cap
a cloying smell filled the air the same one he had noticed when he found garrow in the wreckage of their house
he tilted the flask and a drop of clear shiny liquid fell on his finger
instantly eragon is finger burned as if it were on fire
he yelped and scrubbed his hand on the ground
after a moment the pain subsided to a dull throbbing
a patch of skin had been eaten away
grimacing he jogged back to brom
look what i ** brom took the flask and examined it then poured a bit of the liquid into the cap
eragon started to warn him watch out it will burn
my skin i know said brom
and i suppose you went ahead and poured it all over your hand
