the moment that oromis and glaedr were out of sight saphira said eragon another ** can you believe it
he patted her ** is wonderful
high above du weldenvarden the only sign of habitation in the forest was an occasional ghostly plume of smoke that rose from the crown of a tree and soon faded into clear air
i never expected to encounter another dragon except for shruikan
maybe rescue the eggs from galbatorix yes but that was the extent of my hopes
and now ** wriggled underneath him with ** is incredible is not he he is so old and strong and his scales are so bright
he must be two no three times bigger than me
did you see his claws they
she continued on in that manner for several minutes waxing eloquent about glaedr is attributes
but stronger than her words were the emotions eragon sensed roiling within her eagerness and enthusiasm twined over what he could only identify as a longing adoration
eragon tried to tell saphira what he had learned from oromis since he knew that she had not paid attention but he found it impossible to change the subject of conversation
he sat silently on her back the world an emerald ocean below and felt himself the loneliest man in existence
back at their quarters eragon decided against any sightseeing he was far too tired from the day is events and the weeks of traveling
and saphira was more than content to sit on her bed and chatter about glaedr while he examined the mysteries of the elves wash closet
morning came and with it a package wrapped in onionskin paper containing the razor and mirror that oromis had promised
the blade was of elvish make so it needed no sharpening or stropping
grimacing eragon first bathed in steaming hot water then held up the mirror and confronted his visage
i look older
older and ** only that but his features had become far more angled giving him an ascetic hawklike appearance
he was no elf but neither would anyone take him to be a purebred human if they inspected him closely
pulling back his hair he bared his ears which now tapered to slight points more evidence of how his bond with saphira had changed him
he touched one ear letting his fingers wander over the unfamiliar shape
it was difficult for him to accept the transformation of his flesh
even though he had known it would occur and occasionally welcomed the prospect as the last confirmation that he was a rider the reality of it filled him with confusion
he resented the fact that he had no say in how his body was being altered yet at the same time he was curious where the process would take him
also he was aware that he was still in the midst of his own human adolescence and its attendant realm of mysteries and difficulties
when will i finally know who and what i am
he placed the edge of the razor against his cheek as he had seen garrow do and dragged it across his skin
the hairs came free but they were cut long and ragged
he altered the angle of the blade and tried again with a bit more success
when he reached his chin though the razor slipped in his hand and cut him from the corner of his mouth to the underside of his jaw
he howled and dropped the razor clapping his hand over the incision which poured blood down his neck
spitting the words past bared teeth he said waise ** the pain quickly receded as magic knitted his flesh back together though his heart still pounded from the shock
** saphira
she forced her head and shoulders into the vestibule and nosed open the door to the closet flaring her nostrils at the scent of blood
she eyed the sanguine ** more careful
i d rather you were as ragged as a molting deer than have you decapitate yourself for the sake of a close shave
so would i
go on i am fine
eragon sat glaring at the razor
finally he muttered forget ** composing himself he reviewed his store of words from the ancient language selected those that he needed and then allowed his invented spell to roll off his tongue
a faint stream of black powder fell from his face as his stubble crumbled into dust leaving his cheeks perfectly smooth
satisfied eragon went and saddled saphira who immediately took to the air aiming their course toward the crags of tel naeir
