roran shuddered at sloan is expression and hurried past averting his face so as to avoid meeting his bloodshot gaze
he grabbed a shovel and immediately plunged it into the soil doing his best to forget his worries in the heat of physical exertion
the day progressed in a continuous rush of activity without breaks for meals or rest
the trench grew longer and deeper until it cupped two thirds of the village and reached the banks of the anora river
all the loose dirt was piled on the inside edge of the trench in an attempt to prevent anyone from jumping over it
and to make it difficult to climb out
the wall of trees was finished in early afternoon
roran stopped digging then to help sharpen the innumerable branches which were overlapped and interlocked as much as possible and affix the nets of brambles
occasionally they had to pull out a tree so farmers like ivor could drive their livestock into the safety of carvahall
by evening the fortifications were stronger and more extensive than roran had dared hope though they still required several more hours of work to complete to his satisfaction
he sat on the ground gnawing a hunk of sourdough bread and staring at the stars through a haze of exhaustion
a hand dropped on his shoulder and he looked up to see albriech
** albriech extended a rough shield made of sawed boards pegged together and a six foot long spear
roran accepted them gratefully then albriech proceeded onward distributing spears and shields to whomever he encountered
roran dragged himself upright got his hammer from horst is house and thus armed went to the entrance to the main road where baldor and two others kept watch
wake me when you need to rest roran said then lay on the soft grass underneath the eaves of a nearby house
he arranged his weapons so he could find them in the dark and closed his eyes in eager anticipation
the whisper came from by his right ear
katrina he struggled into a sitting position blinking as she unshuttered a lantern so a key of light struck his thigh
what are you doing here
i wanted to see ** her eyes large and mysterious against her pale face pooled with the night is shadows
she took his arm and led him to a deserted porch far out of earshot of baldor and the other guards
there she placed her hands on his cheeks and softly kissed him but he was too tired and troubled to respond to her affection
she drew away and studied him
what is wrong roran
a bark of humorless laughter escaped him
what is wrong the world is wrong it is as askew as a picture frame knocked on its ** he jammed his fist against his gut
and i am wrong
every time i allow myself to relax i see the soldiers bleeding under my hammer
men ikilled katrina
and their eyes
theireyes ** they knew they were about to die and that they could nothing do about ** he trembled in the darkness
they knew
i knew
and i still had to do it
it could not words failed him as he felt hot tears roll down his cheeks
katrina cradled his head as roran cried from the shock of the past few days
he wept for garrow and eragon he wept for parr quimby and the other dead he wept for himself and he wept for the fate of carvahall
he sobbed until his emotions ebbed and left him as dry and hollow as an old barley husk
forcing himself to take a long breath roran looked at katrina and noticed her own tears
he brushed them away with his thumb like diamonds in the night
katrina
my ** he said it again tasting the words my love
i have naught to give you but my love
still
i must ask
will you marry me
in the dim lantern light he saw pure joy and wonder leap across her face
then she hesitated and troubled doubt appeared
it was wrong for him to ask or for her to accept without sloan is permission
but roran no longer cared he had to know now if he and katrina would spend their lives together
then softly yes roran i will
