** horst shook his finger his mouth full of beans then swallowed
no hunting wo not work
we have to bring our flocks with us
combined we own enough sheep and goats to feed the lot of us for a month or more
i am more worried about keeping the animals from wandering off into the forest replied horst
herding them will be a chore
roran spent the following day assisting whomever he could saying little and generally allowing people to see him working for the good of the village
late that night he tumbled into bed exhausted but hopeful
the advent of dawn pierced roran is dreams and woke him with a sense of momentous expectation
he stood and tiptoed downstairs then went outside and stared at the misty mountains absorbed by the morning is silence
his breath formed a white plume in the air but he felt warm for his heart throbbed with fear and eagerness
after a subdued breakfast horst brought the horses to the front of the house where roran helped albriech and baldor load them with saddlebags and other bundles of supplies
next roran took up his own pack hissing as the leather shoulder strap pressed down on his injury
horst closed the door to the house
he lingered for a moment with his fingers on the steel doorknob then took elain is hand and said let is go
as they walked through carvahall roran saw somber families gathering by their houses with their piles of possessions and yammering livestock
he saw sheep and dogs with bags tied on their backs teary eyed children on donkeys and makeshift sledges hitched to horses with crates of fluttering chickens hung on each side
he saw the fruits of his success and he knew not whether to laugh or to cry
they stopped at carvahall is north end and waited to see who would join them
a minute passed then birgit approached from the side accompanied by nolfavrell and his younger siblings
birgit greeted horst and elain and stationed herself nearby
ridley and his family arrived outside the wall of trees driving over a hundred sheep from the east side of palancar valley
i figured that it would be better to keep them out of carvahall shouted ridley over the animals
next came delwin lenna and their five children orval and his family loring with his sons calitha and thane who gave roran a large smile and then kiselt is clan
those women who had been recently widowed like nolla clustered around birgit
before the sun had cleared the mountain peaks most of the village had assembled along the wall
but not all
morn tara and several others had yet to show themselves and when ivor arrived it was without any supplies
you re staying observed roran
he sidestepped a knot of testy goats that gertrude was attempting to restrain
aye said ivor drawing out the word into a weary admission
he shivered crossed his bony arms for warmth and faced the rising sun lifting his head so as to catch the transparent rays
svart refused to leave
** it was like carving against the grain to get him into the spine in the first place
someone has to look after him an i do not have any children so
he shrugged
doubt i could give up the farm anyway
what will you do when the soldiers arrive
give them a fight that they will remember
roran laughed hoarsely and clapped ivor on the arm doing his best to ignore the unspoken fate that they both knew awaited anyone who remained
a thin middle aged man ethlbert marched to the edge of the congregation and shouted you re all ** with an ominous rustle people turned to look at their accuser
i ve held my peace through this madness but i will not follow a nattering ** if you were not blinded by his words you d see that he is leading you to ** well i wo not ** i will take my chances sneaking past the soldiers and finding refuge in therinsford
they re our own people at least not the barbarians you will find in ** he spat on the ground then spun on his heel and stomped away
afraid that ethlbert might convince others to defect roran scanned the crowd and was relieved to see nothing more than restless muttering
still he did not want to dawdle and give people a chance to change their minds
