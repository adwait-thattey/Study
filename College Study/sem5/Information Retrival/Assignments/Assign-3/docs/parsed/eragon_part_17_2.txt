saphira was right
nothing mattered anymore except the act ** doing is the thing
and what would give him more satisfaction than hunting down the strangers a terrible energy and strength began to grow in him
it grabbed his emotions and forged them into a solid bar of anger with one word stamped on it revenge
his head pounded as he said with conviction i will do it
he severed the contact with saphira and rolled out of bed his body tense like a coiled spring
it was still early morning he had only slept a few ** is more dangerous than an enemy with nothing to lose he ** is what i have become
yesterday he had had difficulty walking upright but now he moved confidently held in place by his iron will
the pain his body sent him was defied and ignored
as he crept out of the house he heard the murmur of two people talking
curious he stopped and listened
elain was saying in her gentle voice
place to stay
we have ** horst answered inaudibly in his bass rumble
yes the poor boy replied elain
this time eragon could hear horst is response
maybe
there was a long pause
i ve been thinking about what eragon said and i am not sure he told us everything
what do you mean asked elain
there was concern in her voice
when we started for their farm the road was scraped smooth by the board he dragged garrow on
then we reached a place where the snow was all trampled and churned up
his footprints and signs of the board stopped there but we also saw the same giant tracks from the farm
and what about his legs i can not believe he did not notice losing that much skin
i did not want to push him for answers earlier but now i think i will
maybe what he saw scared him so much that he does not want to talk about it suggested elain
you saw how distraught he was
that still does not explain how he managed to get garrow nearly all the way here without leaving any tracks
saphira was right thought ** is time to ** many questions from too many ** or later they will find the answers
he continued through the house tensing whenever the floor creaked
the streets were clear few people were up at this time of day
he stopped for a minute and forced himself to ** do not need a horse
saphira will be my steed but she needs a saddle
she can hunt for both of us so i do not have to worry about food though i should get some anyway
whatever else i need i can find buried in our house
he went to gedric is tanning vats on the outskirts of carvahall
the vile smell made him cringe but he kept moving heading for a shack set into the side of a hill where the cured hides were stored
he cut down three large ox hides from the rows of skins hanging from the ceiling
the thievery made him feel guilty but he reasoned it is not really stealing
i will pay gedric back someday along with horst
he rolled up the thick leather and took it to a stand of trees away from the village
he wedged the hides between the branches of a tree then returned to carvahall
now for ** went to the tavern intending to get it there but then smiled tightly and reversed direction
if he was going to steal it might as well be from sloan
he sneaked up to the butcher is house
the front door was barred whenever sloan was not there but the side door was secured with only a thin chain which he broke easily
the rooms inside were dark
he fumbled blindly until his hands came upon hard piles of meat wrapped in cloth
he stuffed as many of them as he could under his shirt then hurried back to the street and furtively closed the door
a woman shouted his name nearby
he clasped the bottom of his shirt to keep the meat from falling out and ducked behind a corner
he shivered as horst walked between two houses not ten feet away
eragon ran as soon as horst was out of sight
his legs burned as he pounded down an alley and back to the trees
he slipped between the tree trunks then turned to see if he was being pursued
no one was there
relieved he let out his breath and reached into the tree for the leather
it was gone
eragon whirled around
brom scowled angrily at him an ugly wound on the side of his head
a short sword hung at his belt in a brown sheath
