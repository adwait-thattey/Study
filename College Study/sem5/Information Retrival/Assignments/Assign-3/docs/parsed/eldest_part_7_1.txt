he stopped and squinted at the sun through his shaggy ** hours till sunset
i wo not be able to stay long
with a sigh he continued along the row of elm trees each of which stood in a pool of uncut grass
this was his first visit to the farm since he horst and six other men from carvahall had removed everything worth salvaging from the destroyed house and burned barn
it had been nearly five months before he could consider returning
once on the hilltop roran halted and crossed his arms
before him lay the remains of his childhood home
a corner of the house still stood crumbling and charred but the rest had been flattened and was already covered with grass and weeds
nothing could be seen of the barn
the few acres they had managed to cultivate each year were now filled with dandelions wild mustard and more grass
here and there stray beets or turnips had survived but that was all
just beyond the farm a thick belt of trees obscured the anora river
roran clenched a fist jaw muscles knotting painfully as he fought back a combination of rage and grief
he stayed rooted to the spot for many long minutes trembling whenever a pleasant memory rushed through him
this place had been his entire life and more
it had been his past
and his future
his father garrow once said the land is a special thing
care for it and it will care for you
not many things will do ** roran had intended to do exactly that up until the moment his world was ruptured by a quiet message from baldor
with a groan he spun away and stalked back toward the road
the shock of that moment still resonated within him
having everyone he loved torn away in an instant was a soul changing event from which he would never recover
it had seeped into every aspect of his behavior and outlook
it also forced roran to think more than ever before
it was as if bands had been cinched around his mind and those bands had snapped allowing him to ponder ideas that were previously unimaginable
such as the fact that he might not become a farmer or that justice the greatest standby in songs and legends had little hold in reality
at times these thoughts filled his consciousness to the point where he could barely rise in the morning feeling bloated with their heaviness
turning on the road he headed north through palancar valley back to carvahall
the notched mountains on either side were laden with snow despite the spring greenery that had crept over the valley floor in past weeks
overhead a single gray cloud drifted toward the peaks
roran ran a hand across his chin feeling the ** caused all this him and his blasted curiosity by bringing that stone out of the spine
it had taken roran weeks to reach that conclusion
he had listened to everyone is accounts
several times he had gertrude the town healer read aloud the letter brom had left him
and there was no other ** that stone was it must have attracted the strangers
for that alone he blamed garrow is death on eragon though not in anger he knew that eragon had intended no harm
no what roused his fury was that eragon had left garrow unburied and fled palancar valley abandoning his responsibilities to gallop off with the old storyteller on some harebrained ** could eragon have so little regard for those left behind did he run because he felt guilty afraid did brom mislead him with wild tales of adventure and why would eragon listen to such things at a time like that
i do not even know if he is dead or alive right now
roran scowled and rolled his shoulders trying to clear his ** is letter
** he had never heard a more ridiculous collection of insinuations and ominous hints
the only thing it made clear was to avoid the strangers which was common sense to begin ** old man was crazy he decided
a flicker of movement caused roran to turn and he saw twelve deer including a young buck with velvet horns trotting back into the trees
he made sure to note their location so he could find them tomorrow
he was proud that he could hunt well enough to support himself in horst is house though he had never been as skilled as eragon
