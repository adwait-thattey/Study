saphira set the pace a leisurely crawl that allowed her and eragon to enjoy the pleasure of each other is company before they immersed themselves in the noise and chaos that were sure to assault them once they neared the camp
eragon inquired after roran and katrina then said have you been eating enough fireweed your breath seems stronger than usual
of course i have
you only notice it because you have been gone for many days
i smell exactly as a dragon should smell and i will thank you not to make disparaging comments about it unless you want me to drop you on your head
besides you humans have nothing to brag about sweaty greasy pungent things that you are
the only creatures in the wild as smelly as humans are male goats and hibernating bears
compared to you the scent of a dragon is a perfume as delightful as a meadow of mountain flowers
come now do not exaggerate
although he said wrinkling his nose since the agaeti blodhren i have noticed that humans tend to be rather smelly
but you cannot lump me in with the rest for i am no longer entirely human
perhaps not but you still need a **
as they crossed the plain more and more men congregated around eragon and saphira providing them with a wholly unnecessary but very impressive honor guard
after so long spent in the wilds of alagaesia the dense press of bodies the cacophony of high excited voices the storm of unguarded thoughts and emotions and the confused motion of flailing arms and prancing horses were overwhelming for eragon
he retreated deep within himself where the discordant mental chorus was no louder than the distant thunder of crashing waves
even through the layers of barriers he sensed the approach of twelve elves running in formation from the other side of the camp swift and lean as yellow eyed mountain cats
wanting to make a favorable impression eragon combed his hair with his fingers and squared his shoulders but he also tightened the armor around his consciousness so that no one but saphira could hear his thoughts
the elves had come to protect him and saphira but ultimately their allegiance belonged to queen islanzadi
while he was grateful for their presence and he doubted their inherent politeness would allow them to eavesdrop on him he did not want to provide the queen of the elves with any opportunity to learn the secrets of the varden nor to gain a hold over him
if she could wrest him away from nasuada he knew she would
on the whole the elves did not trust humans not after galbatorix is betrayal and for that and other reasons he was sure islanzadi would prefer to have him and saphira under her direct command
and of the potentates he had met he trusted islanzadi the least
she was too imperious and too erratic
the twelve elves halted before saphira
they bowed and twisted their hands as arya had done and one by one introduced themselves to eragon with the initial phrase of the elves traditional greeting to which he replied with the appropriate lines
then the lead elf a tall handsome male with glossy blue black fur covering his entire body proclaimed the purpose of their mission to everyone within earshot and formally asked eragon and saphira if the twelve might assume their duties
then eragon asked blodhgarm vodhr did i perchance see you at the agaeti blodhren for he remembered watching an elf with a similar pelt gamboling among the trees during the festivities
blodhgarm smiled exposing the fangs of an animal
i believe you met my cousin liotha
we share a most striking family resemblance although her fur is brown and flecked whereas mine is dark blue
i would have sworn it was you
unfortunately i was otherwise engaged at the time and was unable to attend the celebration
perhaps i shall have the opportunity when next the occasion occurs a hundred years from now
would you not agree saphira said to eragon that he has a pleasant aroma
eragon sniffed the air
i do not smell anything
and i would if there was anything to smell
that is odd
she provided him then with the range of odors she had detected and at once he realized what she meant
