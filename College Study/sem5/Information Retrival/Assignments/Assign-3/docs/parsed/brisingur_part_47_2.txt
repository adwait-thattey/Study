may the stars watch over you eragon replied oromis
then eragon repeated the ceremony with glaedr
as always the touch of the dragon is sanguine consciousness awed and humbled eragon
saphira did not greet either oromis or glaedr she remained where she was her neck drooping until her nose brushed the ground and her shoulders and haunches trembling as if with cold
dry yellow foam encrusted the corners of her open mouth
her barbed tongue hung limp from between her fangs
by way of explanation eragon said we ran into a headwind the day after we left farthen dur and
he fell silent as glaedr lifted his giant head and swung it across the clearing until he was looking down upon saphira who made no attempt to acknowledge his presence
then glaedr breathed out upon her fingers of flame burning within the pits of his nostrils
a sense of relief washed over eragon as he felt energy pour into saphira stilling her tremors and strengthening her limbs
the flames in glaedr is nostrils vanished with a wisp of smoke
i went hunting this morning he said his mental voice resonating throughout eragon is being
you will find what is left of my kills by the tree with the white branch at the far end of the field
eat what you want
silent gratitude emanated from saphira
dragging her limp tail across the grass she crawled over to the tree glaedr had indicated and then settled down and began to tear at the carcass of a deer
come said oromis and gestured toward the table and chairs
on the table was a tray with bowls of fruit and nuts half a round of cheese a loaf of bread a decanter of wine and two crystal goblets
as eragon sat oromis indicated the decanter and asked would you care for a drink to wash the dust from your throat
with an elegant motion oromis unstoppered the decanter and filled both goblets
he handed one to eragon and then settled back into his chair arranging his white tunic with long smooth fingers
eragon sipped the wine
it was mellow and tasted of cherries and plums
master i
an upraised finger from oromis stopped him
unless it is unbearably urgent i would wait until saphira joins us before we discuss what has brought you here
are you agreed
after a moment is hesitation eragon nodded and concentrated upon eating savoring the flavor of the fresh fruit
oromis seemed content to sit beside him in silence drinking his wine and gazing out over the edge of the crags of tel naeir
behind him glaedr watched over the proceedings like a living statue of gold
the better part of an hour passed before saphira rose from her meal crawled over to the stream and lapped the water for another ten minutes
drops of water still clung to her jaws when she turned away from the stream and with a sigh sprawled next to eragon her eyes heavy lidded
she yawned her teeth flashing then exchanged salutations with oromis and glaedr
talk as you want she said
however do not expect me to say much
i may fall asleep at any moment
if you do we shall wait for you to wake before we continue said glaedr
that is most
kind replied saphira and her eyelids drifted even lower
more wine oromis asked and lifted the decanter an inch off the table
when eragon shook his head oromis replaced the decanter then pressed the tips of his fingers together his round fingernails like polished opals
he said you do not need to tell me what has befallen you these past weeks eragon
since islanzadi left the forest arya has kept her informed of the news of the land and every three days islanzadi sends a runner from our army back to du weldenvarden
thus i know of your duel with murtagh and thorn on the burning plains
i know of your trip to helgrind and how you punished the butcher from your village
and i know you attended the dwarves clanmeet in farthen dur and the outcome thereof
whatever you wish to say then you may say without fear of having to educate me about your recent doings
eragon rolled a plump blueberry in the palm of his hand
do you know of elva and what happened when i tried to free her of my curse
yes even that
you may not have succeeded in removing the whole of the spell from her but you paid your debt to the child and that is what a dragon rider is supposed to do fulfill his obligations no matter how small or difficult they be
