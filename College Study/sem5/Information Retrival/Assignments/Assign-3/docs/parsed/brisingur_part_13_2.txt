but tell me nasuada persisted why would you want to know if someone is riding a donkey with a bald patch shaped like a rooster is head
ah that
well the man who owns that particular donkey cheated me at a game of knucklebones out of three buttons and a rather interesting shard of enchanted crystal
angela pursed her lips obviously irked
the knucklebones were loaded
i switched them on him but then he replaced them with a set of his own when i was distracted
i am still not quite sure how he tricked me
it was a valuable ** besides how can you cheat a cheater
before nasuada could respond the six nighthawks came pounding out of the camp and took up positions around her
she hid her distaste as the heat and smell of their bodies assailed her
the odor of the two urgals was especially pungent
then somewhat to her surprise the captain of the shift a burly man with a crooked nose and the name of garven accosted her
my lady may i have a word with you in private he spoke through close set teeth as if struggling to contain a great emotion
angela and elva looked at nasuada for confirmation that she wanted them to withdraw
she nodded and they began walking west toward the jiet river
once nasuada was confident they were out of hearing she began to speak but garven overrode her exclaiming blast it lady nasuada you should not have left us as you **
peace captain she replied
it was a small enough risk and i felt it was important to be here in time to greet the elves
garven is mail rustled as he struck his leg with a bunched fist
a small risk not an hour ago you received proof that galbatorix still has agents hidden among us
he has been able to infiltrate us again and again and yet you see fit to abandon your escort and go racing through a host of potential ** have you forgotten the attack in aberon or how the twins slew your father
captain ** you go too far
i will go even further if it means ensuring your well being
the elves nasuada observed had halved the distance between them and the camp
angry and eager to end the conversation she said i am not without my own protection captain
flicking his eyes toward elva garven said we have suspected as much ** a pause followed as if he were hoping she would volunteer more information
when she remained silent he forged onward if you were actually safe then i was wrong to accuse you of recklessness and i apologize
still safety and the appearance of safety are two different things
for the nighthawks to be effective we have to be the smartest toughest meanest warriors in the land and people have to believe that we re the smartest the toughest and the meanest
they have to believe that if they try to stab you or shoot you with a crossbow or use magic against you that we will stop them
if they believe they have about as much chance of killing you as a mouse does a dragon then they may very well give up the idea as hopeless and we will have averted an attack without ever having to lift a finger
we cannot fight all your enemies lady nasuada
that would take an army
even eragon could not save you if all who want you dead had the courage to act upon their hatred
you might survive a hundred attempts on your life or a thousand but eventually one would succeed
the only way to keep that from happening is to convince the majority of your enemies that they will never get past the nighthawks
our reputation can protect you just as surely as our swords and our armor
it does us no good then for people to see you riding off without us
no doubt we looked a right bunch of fools back there frantically trying to catch up
after all if you do not respect us lady why should anyone else
garven moved closer dropping his voice
we will gladly die for you if we must
all we ask in return is that you allow us to perform our duties
it is a small favor considering
and the day may come when you are grateful we are here
your other protection is human and therefore fallible whatever her arcane powers may be
she has not sworn the same oaths in the ancient language that we of the nighthawks have
