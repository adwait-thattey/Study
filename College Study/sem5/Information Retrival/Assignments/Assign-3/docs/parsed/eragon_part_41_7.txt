he smiled then jerked as she growled again
she must be dreaming he realized
he watched her for a minute then carefully slid out from under her wing
he stood and stretched
the room was cool but not unpleasantly so
murtagh lay on his back in the far corner his eyes closed
as eragon stepped around saphira murtagh stirred
morning he said quietly sitting up
how long have you been awake asked eragon in a hushed voice
awhile
i am surprised saphira did not wake you sooner
i was tired enough to sleep through a thunderstorm said eragon wryly
he sat by murtagh and rested his head against the wall
do you know what time it is
no
it is impossible to tell in here
has anyone come to see us
they sat together without moving or speaking
eragon felt oddly bound to ** ve been carrying his father is sword which would have been his
his inheritance
we re alike in many ways yet our outlook and upbringing are totally different
he thought of murtagh is scar and ** man could do that to a child
saphira lifted her head and blinked to clear her eyes
she sniffed the air then yawned expansively her rough tongue curling at the ** anything happened eragon shook his ** hope they give me more food than that snack last night
i am hungry enough to eat a herd of cows
they d ** positioned herself near the door and settled down to wait tail flicking
eragon closed his eyes enjoying the rest
he dozed awhile then got up and paced around
bored he examined one of the lanterns
it was made of a single piece of teardrop shaped glass about twice the size of a lemon and filled with soft blue light that neither wavered nor flickered
four slim metal ribs wrapped smoothly around the glass meeting at the top to form a small hook and again at the bottom where they melded together into three graceful legs
the whole piece was quite attractive
eragon is inspection was interrupted by voices outside the room
the door opened and a dozen warriors marched inside
the first man gulped when he saw saphira
they were followed by orik and the bald man who declared you have been summoned to ajihad leader of the varden
if you must eat do so while we ** eragon and murtagh stood together watching him warily
where are our horses and can i have my sword and bow back asked eragon
the bald man looked at him with disdain
your weapons will be returned to you when ajihad sees fit not before
as for your horses they await you in the tunnel
now **
as he turned to leave eragon asked quickly how is arya
the bald man hesitated
i do not know
the healers are still with ** he exited the room accompanied by orik
one of the warriors motioned
you go ** eragon went through the doorway followed by saphira and murtagh
they returned through the corridor they had traversed the night before passing the statue of the quilled animal
when they reached the huge tunnel through which they had first entered the mountain the bald man was waiting with orik who held tornac is and snowfire is reins
you will ride single file down the center of the tunnel instructed the bald man
if you attempt to go anywhere else you will be ** when eragon started to climb onto saphira the bald man shouted ** ride your horse until i tell you otherwise
eragon shrugged and took snowfire is reins
he swung into the saddle guided snowfire in front of saphira and told her stay close in case i need your help
murtagh mounted tornac behind saphira
the bald man examined their small line then gestured at the warriors who divided in half to surround them giving saphira as wide a berth as possible
orik and the bald man went to the head of the procession
after looking them over once more the bald man clapped twice and started walking forward
eragon tapped snowfire lightly on his flanks
the entire group headed toward the heart of the mountain
echoes filled the tunnel as the horses hooves struck the hard floor the sounds amplified in the deserted passageway
doors and gates occasionally disturbed the smooth walls but they were always closed
eragon marveled at the sheer size of the tunnel which had been mined with incredible skill the walls floor and ceiling were crafted with flawless precision
