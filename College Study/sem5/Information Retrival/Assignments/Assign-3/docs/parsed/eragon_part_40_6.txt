a formless gray blanket engulfed them limiting their vision to an arm is length
eragon hoped they would not collide with anything in the murk
he stuck out a hand experimentally swinging it through the air
water condensed on it and ran down his arm soaking his sleeve
a blurred gray mass fluttered past his head and he glimpsed a dove its wings pumping frantically
there was a white band around its leg
saphira struck at the bird tongue lashing out jaws gaping
the dove squawked as saphira is sharp teeth snapped together a hair is breadth behind its tail feathers
then it darted away and disappeared into the haze the frenzied thumping of its wings fading to silence
when they breached the top of the clouds saphira is scales were covered with thousands of water droplets that reflected tiny rainbows and shimmered with the blue of her scales
eragon shook himself spraying water from his clothes and shivered
he could no longer see the ground only hills of clouds snaking between the mountains
the trees on the mountains gave way to thick glaciers blue and white under the sun
the glare from the snow forced eragon to close his eyes
he tried to open them after a minute but the light dazzled him
irritated he stared into the crook of his ** can you stand it he asked saphira
my eyes are stronger than yours she replied
it was frigid
the water in eragon is hair froze giving him a shiny helmet
his shirt and pants were hard shells around his limbs
saphira is scales became slick with ice hoarfrost laced her wings
they had never flown this high before yet the mountaintops were still miles above them
saphira is flapping gradually slowed and her breathing became labored
eragon gasped and panted there did not seem to be enough air
fighting back panic he clutched saphira is neck spikes for support
we
have to get out of here he said
red dots swam before his ** can not
breathe
saphira seemed not to hear him so he repeated the message louder this time
again there was no ** can not hear me he realized
he swayed finding it hard to think then pounded on her side and shouted take us **
the effort made him lightheaded
his vision faded into swirling darkness
he regained consciousness as they emerged from the bottom of the clouds
his head was ** happened he asked pushing himself upright and looking around with confusion
he tried to run his fingers through his hair but stopped when he felt ** i know that but why did not you answer me
my brain was confused
your words did not make any sense
when you lost consciousness i knew something was wrong and descended
i did not have to sink far before i realized what had occurred
it is a good thing you did not pass out as well said eragon with a nervous laugh
saphira only swished her tail
he looked wistfully at where the mountain peaks were now concealed by ** pity we could not stand upon one of those summits
well now we know we can only fly out of this valley the way we came in
why did we run out of air how can we have it down here but not up above
i do not know but i will never dare to fly so close to the sun again
we should remember this experience
the knowledge may be useful if we ever have to fight another rider
i hope that never happens said ** is stay down below for now
i ve had enough adventure for one day
they floated on the gentle air currents drifting from one mountain to the next until eragon saw that the urgal column had reached the valley is ** drives them to such speed and how can they bear to sustain it
now that we are closer to them saphira said i can see that these urgals are bigger than the ones we ve met before
they would stand chest and shoulders over a tall man
i do not know what land they march from but it must be a fierce place to produce such brutes
eragon glared at the ground below he could not see the detail that she ** they keep to this pace they will catch murtagh before we find the varden
have hope
the forest may hamper their progress
would it be possible to stop them with magic
eragon shook his ** them
no
there are too many
he thought of the thin layer of mist on the valley floor and ** i might be able to delay them a bit
