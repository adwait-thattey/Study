and what of the urgals asked oromis sipping his tea
are they evil
eragon is knuckles whitened as he gripped his spoon
when i think of death i see an urgal is face
they re worse than beasts
the things they have done
he shook his head unable to continue
eragon what kind of opinion would you form of humans if all you knew of them were the actions of your warriors on the field of battle
that is not
he took a deep breath
it is different
urgals deserve to be wiped out every last one of them
even their females and children the ones who have not harmed you and likely never will the innocents would you kill them and condemn an entire race to the void
they would not spare us given the chance
** exclaimed oromis in biting tones
i never want to hear you use that excuse again that because someone else has done or would do something means that you should too
it is lazy repugnant and indicative of an inferior mind
am i clear
the elf raised his mug to his lips and drank his bright eyes fixed on eragon the entire time
what do you actually know of urgals
i know their strengths weaknesses and how to kill them
it is all i need to know
why do they hate and fight humans though what about their history and legends or the way in which they live
oromis sighed
just remember he said gently that at a certain point your enemies may have to become your allies
such is the nature of life
eragon resisted the urge to argue
he swirled his own tea in its mug accelerating the liquid into a black whirlpool with a white lens of foam at the bottom of the vortex
is that why galbatorix enlisted the urgals
that is not an example i would have chosen but yes
it seems strange that he befriended them
after all they were the ones who killed his dragon
look what he did to us the riders and we were not even responsible for his loss
ah said oromis mad galbatorix may be but he is still as cunning as a fox
i guess that he intended to use the urgals to destroy the varden and the dwarves and others if he had triumphed in farthen dur thereby removing two of his enemies while simultaneously weakening the urgals so that he could dispose of them at his leisure
study of the ancient language devoured the afternoon whereupon they took up the practice of magic
much of oromis is lectures concerned the proper way in which to control various forms of energy such as light heat electricity and even gravity
he explained that since these forces consumed strength faster than any other type of spell it was safer to find them already in existence in nature and then shape them with gramarye instead of trying to create them from nothing
abandoning the subject oromis asked how would you kill with magic
i ve done it many ways said eragon
i ve hunted with a pebble moving and aiming it with magic as well as using the wordjierda to break urgals legs and necks
once withthrysta i stopped a man is heart
there are more efficient methods revealed oromis
what does it take to kill a man eragon a sword through the chest a broken neck the loss of blood all it takes is for a single artery in the brain to be pinched off or for certain nerves to be severed
with the right spell you could obliterate an army
i should have thought of that in farthen dur said eragon disgusted with ** just farthen dur either but also when the kull chased us from the hadarac desert
again why did not brom teach me this
because he did not expect you to face an army for months or years to come it is not a tool given to untested riders
if it is so easy to kill people though what is the point of us or galbatorix raising an army
to be succinct tactics
magicians are vulnerable to physical attack when they are embroiled in their mental struggles
therefore they need warriors to protect them
and the warriors must be shielded at least in part from magical attacks else they would be slain within minutes
these limitations mean that when armies confront one another their magicians are scattered throughout the bulk of their forces close to the edge but not so close as to be in danger
the magicians on both sides open their minds and attempt to sense if anyone is using or is about to use magic
