roran had been occupied at the time preparing to leave for dempton is mill in therinsford but he remembered how distracted eragon had been how he spent every moment he could outdoors doing who knows what
as jeod explained how and why garrow died rage filled roran that eragon had dared keep the dragon secret when it so obviously put everyone in ** is his fault my father died
what was he thinking burst out roran
he hated how jeod looked at him with calm understanding
i doubt eragon knew himself
riders and their dragons are bound together so closely it is often hard to differentiate one from the other
eragon could have no more harmed saphira than he could have sawed off his own leg
he could have muttered roran
because of him i ve had to do things just as painful and i know he could have
you ve a right to feel as you do said jeod but do not forget that the reason eragon left palancar valley was to protect you and all who remained
i believe it was an extremely hard choice for him to make
from his point of view he sacrificed himself to ensure your safety and to avenge your father
and while leaving may not have had the desired effect things would have certainly turned out far worse if eragon had stayed
roran said nothing more until jeod mentioned that the reason brom and eragon had visited teirm was to see if they could use the city is shipping manifests to locate the ra zac is lair
and did they cried roran bolting upright
well where are they then for goodness sake man say it you know how important this is to **
it seemed apparent from the records and i later had a message from the varden that eragon is own account confirmed this that the ra zac is den is in the formation known as helgrind by dras leona
roran gripped his hammer with ** is a long way to dras leona but teirm has access to the only open pass between here and the southern end of the spine
if i can get everyone safely heading down the coast then i could go to this helgrind rescue katrina if she is there and follow the jiet river down to surda
something of roran is thoughts much have revealed themselves on his face because jeod said it can not be done roran
no one man can take helgrind
it is a solid bare black mountain of stone that is impossible to climb
consider the ra zac is foul steeds it seems likely they would have an eyrie near the top of helgrind rather than bed near the ground where they are most vulnerable
how then would you reach them and if you could do you really believe that you could defeat both ra zac and their two steeds if not more i have no doubt you are a fearsome warrior after all you and eragon share blood but these are foes beyond any normal human
roran shook his head
i can not abandon katrina
it may be futile but i must try to free her even if it costs me my life
it wo not do katrina any good if you get yourself killed admonished jeod
if i may offer a bit of advice try to reach surda as you ve planned
once there i am sure you can enlist eragon is help
even the ra zac cannot match a rider and dragon in open combat
in his mind is eye roran saw the huge gray skinned beasts the ra zac rode upon
he was loath to acknowledge it but he knew that such creatures were beyond his ability to kill no matter the strength of his motivation
the instant he accepted that truth roran finally believed jeod is tale for if he did not katrina was forever lost to him
eragon he ** by the blood i ve spilled and the gore on my hands i swear upon my father is grave i will have you atone for what you ve done by storming helgrind with me
if you created this mess then i will have you clean it up
roran motioned to jeod
continue your account
let us hear the rest of this sorry play before the day grows much older
then jeod spoke of brom is death of murtagh son of morzan of capture and escape in gil ead of a desperate flight to save an elf of urgals and dwarves and a great battle in a place called farthen dur where eragon defeated a shade
and jeod told them how the varden left the beor mountains for surda and how eragon was even now deep within du weldenvarden learning the elves mysterious secrets of magic and warfare but would soon return
