i do not know
let me ** cried eragon searching arya is memories for her final instructions
he scanned the ground until he found a rock the size of an apple grabbed it then pounded on the cliff next to the falls shouting ai varden abr du shur tugals gata **
he tried again shouting louder than before but only succeeded in bruising his hand
he turned in despair to murtagh
we re trap his words were cut off as saphira leapt out of the lake dousing them with icy water
she landed on the beach and crouched ready to fight
the horses backpedaled wildly trying to bolt
eragon reached out with his mind to steady ** ** cried saphira
he turned and glimpsed the lead urgal running at him heavy spear raised
up close a kull was as tall as a small giant with legs and arms as thick as tree trunks
murtagh drew back his arm and threw his sword with incredible speed
the long weapon revolved once then struck the kull point first in the chest with a dull crunch
the huge urgal toppled to the ground with a strangled gurgle
before another kull could attack murtagh dashed forward and yanked his sword out of the body
eragon raised his palm shouting jierda theirra ** sharp cracks resounded off the cliff
twenty of the charging urgals fell into kostha merna howling and clutching their legs where shards of bone protruded
without breaking stride the rest of the urgals advanced over their fallen companions
eragon struggled against his weariness putting a hand on saphira for support
a flight of arrows impossible to see in the darkness brushed past them and clattered against the cliff
eragon and murtagh ducked covering their heads
with a small growl saphira jumped over them so that her armored sides shielded them and the horses
a chorus of clinks sounded as a second volley of arrows bounced off her scales
what now shouted murtagh
there was still no opening in the cliff
we can not stay **
eragon heard saphira snarl as an arrow caught the edge of her wing tearing the thin membrane
he looked around wildly trying to understand why arya is instructions had not worked
i do not ** this is where we re supposed to **
why do not you ask the elf to make sure demanded murtagh
he dropped his sword snatched his bow from tornac is saddlebags and with a swift motion loosed an arrow from between the spikes on saphira is back
a moment later an urgal toppled into the water
now she is barely ** how is she going to find the energy to say anything
i do notknow shouted murtagh but you d better think ofsomething because we can not stave off an entire **
we re on the wrong side of the ** i ve seen arya is memories through you and i just realized that this is not the right ** tucked her head against her breast as another flight of arrows sped toward them
her tail flicked in pain as they struck ** can not keep this ** they re tearing me to pieces
eragon slammed zar roc back into its sheath and exclaimed the varden are on the other side of the lake
we have to go through the ** he noted with dread that the urgals across kostha merna were almost to the falls
murtagh is eyes shot toward the violent deluge blocking their way
we will never get the horses through there even if we can hold our own footing
i will convince them to follow us snapped eragon
and saphira can carry ** the urgals cries and bellows made snowfire snort angrily
the elf lolled on his back oblivious to the danger
murtagh shrugged
it is better than being hacked to ** he swiftly cut arya loose from snowfire is saddle and eragon caught the elf as she slid to the ground
i am ready said saphira rising into a half crouch
the approaching urgals hesitated unsure of her intentions
** cried eragon
he and murtagh heaved arya onto saphira then secured her legs in the saddle is straps
the second they were finished saphira swept up her wings and soared over the lake
the urgals behind her howled as they saw her escaping
arrows clattered off her belly
the kull on the other shore redoubled their pace so as to attain the waterfall before she landed
eragon reached out with his mind to force himself into the frightened thoughts of the horses
