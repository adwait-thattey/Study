you wonder why i see you do
because unless this war ends and sooner rather than later it will drive me insane
i find it hard enough to deal with the agonies of everyday life without also having to confront the atrocities of battle
use me to end it and i will ensure that your life is as happy as any human has had the privilege to experience
at that moment the crone scurried back into the room bowed to elva and handed her a new platter of food
it was a physical relief to nasuada as elva looked down and attacked a leg of mutton cramming the meat into her mouth with both hands
she ate with the ravenous intensity of a gorging wolf displaying a complete lack of decorum
with her violet eyes hidden and her dragon mark covered by black bangs she once again appeared to be nothing more than an innocent child
nasuada waited until it became apparent that elva had said all she was going to
then at a gesture from angela she accompanied the herbalist through a side door leaving the pale girl sitting alone in the center of the dark cloth bound room like a dire fetus nestled in its womb waiting for the right moment to emerge
angela made sure that the door was closed and whispered all she does is eat and eat
we can not sate her appetite with the current rations
can you
she will be fed
you need not worry about ** nasuada rubbed her arms trying to eradicate the memory of those awful horrible eyes
has this ever happened to anyone else
angela shook her head until her curly hair bounced on her shoulders
not in the entire history of magic
i tried to cast her future but it is a hopeless quagmire lovely word quagmire because her life interacts with so many others
angela shrugged
she is more dangerous than some and less than others
the one she is most likely to kill though is herself
if she meets someone who is about to be hurt and eragon is spell catches her unawares then she will take the doomed person is place
that is why she stays inside most of the time
how far in advance can she foretell events
two or three hours at the most
leaning against the wall nasuada considered the newest complication in her life
elva could be a potent weapon if she were applied ** her i can discern my opponents troubles and weaknesses as well as what will please them and make them amenable to my wishes
in an emergency the girl could also act as an infallible guard if one of the varden like eragon or saphira had to be protected
she can not be left unsupervised
i need someone to watch her
someone who understands magic and is comfortable enough with their own identity to resist elva is influence
and who i can trust to be reliable and ** immediately discounted trianna
nasuada looked at angela
though she was wary of the herbalist she knew that angela had helped the varden with matters of the utmost delicacy and importance like healing eragon and had asked for nothing in return
nasuada could think of no one else who had the time inclination and expertise to look after elva
i realize said nasuada that this is presumptuous of me as you are not under my command and i know little of your life or duties but i have a favor to ask of you
nasuada faltered disconcerted then forged ahead
would you be willing to keep an eye on elva for me i need
of ** and i will keep two eyes on her if i can spare them
i relish the opportunity to study her
you will have to report to me warned nasuada
the poison dart hidden in the raisin tart
ah well i suppose i can manage
relieved nasuada groaned and sank into a nearby chair
oh what a mess
what aquagmire
as eragon is liegelord i am responsible for his deeds but i never imagined that he would do anything as dreadful as this
it is a blight on my honor as much as his
a ripple of sharp pops filled the room as angela cracked her knuckles
yes
i intend to speak to him about it once he returns from ellesmera
her expression was so fierce it alarmed nasuada
well do not hurt him
we need him
i wo not
permanently
