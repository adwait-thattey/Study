he rested the large rock on his thighs for an instant and then grunting pressed it overhead and locked his arms straight
for a full minute he held the crushing weight in the air
when his shoulders were trembling and about to fail he threw the boulder onto the ground in front of him
it landed with a dull thud leaving an indentation several inches deep in the dirt
on either side of roran twenty of the varden is warriors struggled to lift boulders of similar size
only two succeeded the rest returned to the lighter rocks they were accustomed to
it pleased roran that the months he had spent in horst is forge and the years of farmwork before had given him the strength to hold his own with men who had drilled with their weapons every day since they turned twelve
roran shook the fire from his arms and took several deep breaths the air cool against his bare chest
reaching up he massaged his right shoulder cupping the round ball of muscle and exploring it with his fingers confirming once again that no trace remained of the injury he had suffered when the ra zac had bitten him
he grinned glad to be whole and sound again being as it had seemed no likelier to him than a cow dancing a jig
a yelp of pain caused him to look over at albriech and baldor who were sparring with lang a swarthy battle scarred veteran who taught the arts of war
even two against one lang held his own and with his wooden practice sword he had disarmed baldor knocked him across the ribs and jabbed albriech so hard in the leg he fell sprawling all in the span of a few seconds
roran empathized with them he had just finished his own session with lang and it had left him with several new bruises to go with his faded ones from helgrind
for the most part he preferred his hammer over a sword but he thought he should still be able to handle a blade if the occasion called for it
swords required more finesse than he felt most fights deserved bash a swordsman on the wrist and armored or not he would be too preoccupied with his broken bones to defend himself
after the battle of the burning plains nasuada had invited the villagers from carvahall to join the varden
they had all accepted her offer
those who would have refused had already elected to stay in surda when the villagers stopped in dauth on their way to the burning plains
every able bodied man from carvahall had taken up proper arms discarding their makeshift spears and shields and had worked to become warriors equal to any in alagaesia
the people of palancar valley were accustomed to a hard life
swinging a sword was no worse than chopping wood and it was a far sight easier than breaking sod or hoeing acres of beets in the heat of summer
those who knew a useful trade continued to ply their craft in service to the varden but in their spare time they still strove to master the weapons given to them for every man was expected to fight when the call to battle sounded
roran had devoted himself to the training with unwavering dedication since returning from helgrind
helping the varden defeat the empire and ultimately galbatorix was the one thing he could do to protect the villagers and katrina
he was not arrogant enough to believe that he alone could tip the balance of the war but he was confident in his ability to shape the world and knew that if he applied himself he could increase the varden is chances of victory
he had to stay alive though and that meant conditioning his body and mastering the tools and techniques of slaughter so as to avoid falling to a more experienced warrior
as he crossed the practice field on his way back to the tent he shared with baldor roran passed a strip of grass sixty feet long whereon lay a twenty foot log stripped of its bark and polished smooth by the thousands of hands that rubbed against it every day
without breaking his stride roran turned slipped his fingers under the thick end of the log lifted it and grunting from the strain walked it upright
he gave the log a push then and it toppled over
grabbing the thin end he repeated the process twice more
