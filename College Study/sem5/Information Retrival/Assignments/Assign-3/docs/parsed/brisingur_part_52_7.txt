the werecat knew whereof he spoke there is a nodule of brightsteel ore buried at the very edge of my roots but you shall not have it
you bit me and you burned me and i do not forgive you
alarm tempered eragon is excitement at hearing of the ore is existence
but saphira is the last female ** he exclaimed
surely you would not kill her
dragons breathe fire whispered the voice and a shudder ran through the trees at the edge of the clearing
fires must be extinguished
saphira growled again and said if we cannot stop the man who destroyed the dragon riders he will come here and he will burn the forest around you and then he will destroy you as well elf tree
if you help us though we may be able to stop him
a screech echoed among the trees as two branches scraped against each other
if he tries to kill my seedlings then he will die said the voice
no one is as strong as the whole of the forest
no one can hope to defeat the forest and i speak for the forest
is not the energy we gave you enough to repair your wounds asked eragon
is not it compensation enough
the menoa tree did not answer but rather probed at eragon is mind sweeping through his thoughts like a gust of wind
what are you rider said the tree
i know every creature that lives among this forest but never have i encountered one like you
i am neither elf nor human said eragon
i am something in between
the dragons changed me during the blood oath celebration
why did they change you rider
so that i could better fight galbatorix and his empire
i remember i felt a warping in the world during the celebration but i did not think it was important
so little seems important now save the sun and the rain
eragon said we will heal your root and trunk if that will satisfy you but please may we have the brightsteel
the other trees creaked and moaned like abandoned souls and then soft and fluttering the voice came again
will you give me what i want in return dragon rider
i will eragon said without hesitation
whatever the price he would gladly pay it for a rider is sword
the canopy of the menoa tree grew still and for several minutes all was quiet in the clearing
then the ground began to shake and the roots in front of eragon began to twist and grind shedding flakes of bark as they pulled aside to reveal a bare patch of dirt out of which emerged what appeared to be a lump of corroded iron roughly two feet long and a foot and a half wide
as the ore came to rest on the surface of the rich black soil eragon felt a slight twinge in his lower belly
he winced and rubbed at the spot but the momentary flare of discomfort had already vanished
then the root around his ankle loosened and retreated into the ground as did those that had been holding saphira in place
here is your metal whispered the menoa tree
take it and go
go
said the menoa tree its voice fading away
go
and the tree is consciousness withdrew from him and saphira receding deeper and deeper into itself until eragon could barely sense its presence
around them looming pines relaxed and resumed their usual positions
but
eragon said out loud puzzled that the menoa tree had not told him what she wanted
still perplexed he went over to the ore slid his fingers under the edge of the metal laced stone and hoisted the irregular mass into his arms grunting at its weight
hugging it against his chest he turned away from the menoa tree and started the long walk toward rhunon is house
saphira sniffed the brightsteel as she joined him
you were right she said
i should not have attacked her
at least we got the brightsteel said eragon and the menoa tree
well i do not know what she got but we have what we came for and that is what matters
the elves gathered alongside the path eragon had chosen to follow and gazed at eragon and saphira with an intensity that made eragon quicken his pace and the skin on the nape of his neck prickle
not once did the elves speak only stared with their slanting eyes stared as if they were watching a dangerous animal stalk through their homes
a puff of smoke billowed from saphira is nostrils
