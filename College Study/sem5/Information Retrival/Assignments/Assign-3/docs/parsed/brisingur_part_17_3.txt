you negotiate treaties and alliances such as that with the urgals of your own initiative and expect me and others to abide by your decisions as if you speak for us all
you arrange preemptive visits of state such as that with blodhgarmvodhr and do not trouble to alert me of his arrival nor wait for me to join you so we might greet his embassy together as equals
and when i have the temerity to ask why eragon the man whose very existence is the reason i have staked my country in this venture when i have the temerity to ask why this all important person has elected to endanger the lives of surdans and those of every creature who opposes galbatorix by tarrying in the midst of our enemies how is it you respond by treating me as if i were no more than an overzealous overinquisitive underling whose childish concerns distracted you from more pressing matters
** i will not have it i tell you
if you cannot bring yourself to respect my station and to accept a fair division of responsibility as two allies ought to then it is my opinion that you are unfit to command a coalition such as ours and i shall set myself against you however i may
what a long winded fellow saphira observed
alarmed by the direction the conversation had taken eragon said what should i do i had not intended to tell anyone else about sloan except for nasuada
the fewer people who know he is alive the better
a flickering sea blue shimmer ran from the base of saphira is head to the crest of her shoulders as the tips of the sharp diamond shaped scales along the sides of her neck rose a fraction of an inch from the underlying skin
the jagged layers of projecting scales gave her a fierce ruffled appearance
i cannot tell you what is best eragon
in this you must rely upon your own judgment
listen closely to what your heart says and perhaps it will become clear how to win free of these treacherous downdrafts
in response to king orrin is sally nasuada clasped her hands in her lap her bandages startling white against the green of her dress and in a calm even voice said if i have slighted you sire then it was due to my own hasty carelessness and not to any desire on my part to diminish you or your house
please forgive my lapses
they shall not happen again that i promise you
as you have pointed out i have but recently ascended to this post and i have yet to master all of the accompanying niceties
orrin inclined his head in a cool but gracious acceptance of her words
as for eragon and his activities in the empire i could not have provided you with specific details for i have had no further intelligence myself
it was not as i am sure you can appreciate a situation that i wished to advertise
therefore it seems to me that the swiftest cure for the dispute that afflicts us is to allow eragon to lay bare the facts of his trip that we may apprehend the full scope of this event and render judgment upon it
of its own that is not a cure said king orrin
but it is the beginning of a cure and i will gladly listen
then let us tarry no longer said nasuada
let us begin this beginning and have done with our suspense
eragon it is time for your tale
with nasuada and the others gazing at him with wondering eyes eragon made his choice
lifting his chin he said what i tell you i tell you in confidence
i know i cannot expect either you king orrin or you lady nasuada to swear that you will keep this secret bound within your hearts from now until the day you die but i beg you to act as if you had
it could cause a great deal of grief if this knowledge were to be whispered in the wrong ears
a king does not remain king for long unless he appreciates the value of silence said orrin
without further ado eragon described everything that had happened to him in helgrind and in the days that had followed
afterward arya explained how she had gone about locating eragon and then corroborated his account of their travels by providing several facts and observations of her own
when they had both said their fill the pavilion was quiet as orrin and nasuada sat motionless upon their chairs
