i ve not sheen you round my leafy exile no i have not
you ve abandoned me to the company of elves
and misherable dull company they are yesh indeed
a touch of guilt made eragon disguise himself with an awkward smile
hehad forgotten the dwarf amid the goings on
i am sorry i have not visited you orik but my studies have kept me busy
here give me your ** as he helped the dwarf out of his brown mantle he asked what are you drinking
faelnirv declared orik
a mosht wonderful ticklish potion
the besht and greatest of the elves tricksty inventions it gives you the gift of loquacion
words float from your tongue like shoals of flapping minnows like flocks of breathlessh hummingbirds like rivers of writhing ** he paused apparently taken by the unique magnificence of his similes
as eragon ushered him into the bedroom orik saluted saphira with his bottle and said greetings o irontooth
may your shcales shine as bright as the coals of morgothal is forge
greetings orik said saphira laying her head on the rim of her ** has put you in this state it is not like you
eragon repeated her question
what has put me in mine shtate repeated orik
he dropped into the chair that eragon provided his feet dangling several inches above the ground and began to shake his head
red cap green cap elves here and elves there
i drown in elvesh and their thrice damned courtesy
bloodless they be
taciturn they are
yesh sir no shir three bagsh full sir yet nary a pip more can i ** he looked at eragon with a mournful expression
what am i to do while you meander through your instruction am i to sit and twiddle mine thumbs while i turn to shtone and join the shpirits of mine anshestors tell me o sagacious rider
have you no skills or hobbies that you might occupy yourself with asked saphira
aye said orik
i am a fair enough smith by any who d care to judge
but why should i craft bright armsh and armor for those who treasure them not i am usheless here
as usheless as a three legged feldunost
eragon extended a hand toward the bottle
may i orik glanced between him and the bottle then grimaced and gave it up
the faelnirv was cold as ice as it ran down eragon is throat stinging and smarting
he blinked as his eyes watered
after he indulged in a second quaff he passed the bottle back to orik who seemed disappointed by how little of the concoction remained
and what mischief asked orik have you two managed to ferret out of oromis and yon bucolic woods
the dwarf alternately chuckled and groaned as eragon described his training his misplaced blessing in farthen dur the menoa tree his back and all else that had filled the past few days
eragon ended with the topic that was dearest to him at the moment arya
emboldened by the liqueur he confessed his affection for her and described how she had dismissed his advance
wagging a finger orik said the rock beneath you is flawed eragon
do not tempt fate
arya
he stopped then growled and took another gulp of faelnirv
ah it is too late for thish
who am i to say what is wisdom and what is not
saphira had closed her eyes a while ago
without opening them she asked are you married orik the question surprised eragon he had never stopped to wonder about orik is personal life
eta said orik
although i am promished to fair hvedra daughter of thorgerd one eye and himinglada
we were to be wed thish spring until the urgals attacked and hrothgar sent me on this accursed trip
is she of durgrimst ingeitum asked eragon
of ** roared orik pounding his fist on the side of the chair
thinkest thou i would marry outside my clan she is the granddaughter of mine aunt vardrun hrothgar is coushin twice removed with white round calves as smooth as satin cheeks as red as apples and the prettiesht dwarf maid who ever did exist
i am sure it wo not be long before you see her again said eragon
** orik squinted at eragon
do you believe in giants tall giants shtrong giants thick and bearded giants with fingers like spadeses
i ve never seen nor heard of them said eragon except in stories
if they do exist it is not in alagaesia
ah but they ** they ** exclaimed orik waving the bottle about his head
