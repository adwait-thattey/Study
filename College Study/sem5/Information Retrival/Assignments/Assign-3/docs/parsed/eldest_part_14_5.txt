hert durgrimst fild rastn shouted the strange dwarf
orik thrifkz menthiv oen hrethcarach eragon rak durgrimst ingeitum answered orik
wharn az vanyali carharug arya
ne oc undinz ** the goat stared warily at saphira
eragon noted how bright and intelligent its eyes were though its face was rather droll with its frosty beard and somber expression
it reminded him of hrothgar and he almost laughed thinking how very dwarfish the animal was
azt jok jordn rast came the reply
with no discernible command on the dwarf is part the goat leaped forward covering such an extraordinary distance it seemed to take flight for a moment
then rider and steed vanished between the trees
what was that asked eragon amazed
orik resumed walking
a feldunost one of the five animals unique to these mountains
a clan is named after each one
however durgrimst feldunost is perhaps the bravest and most revered of the clans
we depend upon feldunost for milk wool and meat
without their sustenance we could not live in the beors
when galbatorix and his traitorous riders were terrorizing us it was durgrimst feldunost who risked themselves and still do to tend the herds and fields
as such we are all in their debt
do all dwarves ride feldunost he stumbled slightly over the unusual word
only in the mountains
feldunost are hardy and sure footed but they are better suited for cliffs than open plains
saphira nudged eragon with her nose causing snowfire to shy ** those would be good hunting better than any i had in the spine or ** if i have time in tarnag
no he ** can not afford to offend the dwarves
she snorted ** could ask permission first
now the path that had concealed them for so long under dark boughs entered the great clearing that surrounded tarnag
groups of observers had already begun to gather in the fields when seven feldunost with jeweled harnesses bounded out from the city
their riders bore lances tipped with pennants that snapped like whips in the air
reining in his strange beast the lead dwarf said thou art well come to this city of tarnag
by otho of undin and gannel i thorv son of brokk offer in peace the shelter of our ** his accent grumbled and rasped with a rough burr quite unlike orik is
and by hrothgar is otho we of the ingeitum accept your hospitality responded orik
as do i in islanzadi is stead added arya
appearing satisfied thorv motioned to his fellow riders who spurred their feldunost into formation around the four of them
with a flourish the dwarves rode off guiding them to tarnag and through the city gates
the outer wall was forty feet thick and formed a shadowed tunnel to the first of the many farms that belted tarnag
five more tiers each of which was defended by a fortified gate carried them past the fields and into the city proper
in contrast to tarnag is thickly built ramparts the buildings within though of stone were shaped with such cunning as to give the impression of grace and lightness
strong bold carvings usually of animals adorned the houses and shops
but even more striking was the stone itself vibrant hues from bright scarlet to the subtlest of greens glazed the rock in translucent layers
and hung throughout the city were the dwarves flameless lanterns their multicolored sparks harbingers of the beors long dusk and night
unlike tronjheim tarnag had been constructed in proportion to the dwarves with no concession for human elf or dragon visitors
at the most doorways were five feet high and they were often only four and a half
eragon was of middling height but now he felt like a giant transported onto a puppet stage
the streets were wide and crammed
dwarves of various clans hurried about their business or stood haggling in and around shops
many were garbed in strange exotic costumes such as a block of fierce black haired dwarves who wore silver helmets forged in the likeness of wolf heads
eragon stared at the dwarf women the most as he had only caught brief glimpses of them while in tronjheim
they were broader than the men and their faces were heavyset yet their eyes sparkled and their hair was lustrous and their hands were gentle on their diminutive children
