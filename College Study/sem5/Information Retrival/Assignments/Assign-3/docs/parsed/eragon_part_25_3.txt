his gray eyes took in every detail
he raised his eyebrows and said i assume then that you are fulfilling your duty
brom shook his head
no it is not that simple
it was stolen a while ago at least that is what i presume for i have not received word from our friends and i suspect their messengers were waylaid so i decided to find out what i could
eragon happened to be traveling in the same direction
we have stayed together for a time now
jeod looked puzzled
but if they have not sent any messages how could you know that it was
brom overrode him quickly saying eragon is uncle was brutally killed by the ra zac
they burned his home and nearly caught him in the process
he deserves revenge but they have left us without a trail to follow and we need help finding them
jeod is face cleared
i see
but why have you come here i do not know where the ra zac might be hiding and anyone who does wo not tell you
standing brom reached into his robe and pulled out the ra zac is flask
he tossed it to jeod
there is seithr oil in there the dangerous kind
the ra zac were carrying it
they lost it by the trail and we happened to find it
we need to see teirm is shipping records so we can trace the empire is purchases of the oil
that should tell us where the ra zac is lair is
lines appeared on jeod is face as he thought
he pointed at the books on the shelves
do you see those they are all records from my ** business
you have gotten yourself into a project that could take months
there is another greater problem
the records you seek are held in this castle but only brand risthart is administrator of trade sees them on a regular basis
traders such as myself are not allowed to handle them
they fear that we will falsify the results thus cheating the empire of its precious taxes
i can deal with that when the time comes said brom
but we need a few days of rest before we can think about proceeding
jeod smiled
it seems that it is my turn to help you
my house is yours of course
do you have another name while you are here
yes said brom i am neal and the boy is evan
eragon said jeod thoughtfully
you have a unique name
few have ever been named after the first rider
in my life i ve read about only three people who were called ** eragon was startled that jeod knew the origin of his name
brom looked at eragon
could you go check on the horses and make sure they re all right i do not think i tied snowfire to the ring tightly enough
they re trying to hide something from me
the moment i leave they re going to talk about ** shoved himself out of the chair and left the room slamming the door shut
snowfire had not moved the knot that held him was fine
scratching the horses necks eragon leaned sullenly against the castle wall
it is not fair he complained to ** only i could hear what they are saying
he jolted upright electrified
brom had once taught him some words that would enhance his ** ears are not exactly what i want but i should be able to make the words work
after all look what i could do with brisingr
he concentrated intensely and reached for his power
once it was within his grasp he said thverr stenr un atra eka ** and imbued the words with his will
as the power rushed out of him he heard a faint whisper in his ears but nothing more
disappointed he sank back then started as jeod said and i ve been doing that for almost eight years now
eragon looked around
no one was there except for a few guards standing against the far wall of the keep
grinning he sat on the courtyard and closed his eyes
i never expected you to become a merchant said brom
after all the time you spent in books
and finding the passageway in that ** what made you take up trading instead of remaining a scholar
after gil ead i did not have much taste for sitting in musty rooms and reading scrolls
i decided to help ajihad as best i could but i am no warrior
my father was a merchant as well you may remember that
he helped me get started
however the bulk of my business is nothing more than a front to get goods into surda
but i take it that things have been going badly said brom
yes none of the shipments have gotten through lately and tronjheim is running low on supplies
