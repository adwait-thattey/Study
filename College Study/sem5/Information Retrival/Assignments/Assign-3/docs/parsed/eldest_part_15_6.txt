glenwing loved speaking to birds with his mind
he would stand in the forest surrounded by a flock of songbirds and listen to their music for hours
afterward he might sing us the prettiest melodies
and faolin this time arya refused to answer though her hands tightened on her bow
undaunted eragon cast around for another subject
why do you dislike gannel so much
she faced him suddenly and touched his cheek with soft fingers
eragon flinched with surprise
that she said is a discussion for another ** then she stood and calmly relocated herself across the courtyard
confused eragon stared at her ** do not understand he said leaning against saphira is belly
she snorted amused then curled her neck and tail around him and promptly fell asleep
as the valley darkened eragon struggled to stay alert
he pulled out gannel is necklace and examined it several times with magic but found only the priest is guarding spell
giving up he replaced the necklace under his tunic pulled his shield over him and settled down to wait through the night
at the first hint of light in the sky overhead though the valley itself was still in shadow and would remain so until almost midday eragon roused saphira
the dwarves were already up busy muffling their weapons so they could creep through tarnag with utter secrecy
undin even had eragon tie rags around saphira is claws and snowfire is hooves
when all was ready undin and his warriors assembled in a large block around eragon saphira and arya
the gates were carefully opened no sound came from the oiled hinges and then they set out for the lake
tarnag seemed deserted the vacant streets lined with houses where its inhabitants lay oblivious and dreaming
the few dwarves they encountered gazed at them silently then padded away like ghosts in the twilight
at the gate to each tier a guard waved them through without comment
they soon left the buildings and found themselves crossing the barren fields at tarnag is base
beyond those they reached the stone quay that edged the still gray water
waiting for them were two wide rafts tied alongside a pier
three dwarves squatted on the first raft four on the second
they stood as undin came into view
eragon helped the dwarves hobble and blindfold snowfire then coax the reluctant horse onto the second raft where he was forced to his knees and tied down
meanwhile saphira slipped off the pier into the lake
only her head remained above the surface as she paddled through the water
undin grasped eragon is arm
here is where we part
you have my best men they will protect you until you reach du ** eragon tried to thank him but undin shook his head
no it is not a matter for gratitude
it is my duty
i am only shamed that your stay was darkened by the hatred of az sweldn rak anhuin
eragon bowed then boarded the first raft with orik and arya
the mooring ropes were unknotted and the dwarves pushed away from shore with long poles
as dawn approached the two rafts drifted toward the mouth of the az ragni saphira swimming between them
