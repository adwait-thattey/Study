** i have to do better he thought
underestimating the king was a sure way to get them all killed
roran swore and said warn me before you do something like that again
hunching forward eragon began to unbuckle his legs from the saddle as he studied their surroundings alert for danger
the opening to the cave was an irregular oval perhaps fifty feet high and sixty feet wide
from there the chamber expanded to twice that size before ending a good bowshot away in a pile of thick stone slabs that leaned against each other in a confusion of uncertain angles
a mat of scratches defaced the floor evidence of the many times the lethrblaka had taken off from landed on and walked about its surface
like mysterious keyholes five low tunnels pierced the sides of the cave as did a lancet passageway large enough to accommodate saphira
eragon examined the tunnels carefully but they were pitch black and appeared vacant a fact he confirmed with quick thrusts of his mind
strange disjointed murmurs echoed from within helgrind is innards suggesting unknown things scurrying about in the dark and endlessly dripping water
adding to the chorus of whispers was the steady rise and fall of saphira is breathing which was overloud in the confines of the bare chamber
the most distinctive feature of the cavern however was the mixture of odors that pervaded it
the smell of cold stone dominated but underneath eragon discerned whiffs of damp and mold and something far worse the sickly sweet fetor of rotting meat
undoing the last few straps eragon swung his right leg over saphira is spine so he was sitting sidesaddle and prepared to jump off her back
roran did the same on the opposite side
before he released his hold eragon heard amid the many rustlings that teased his ear a score of simultaneous clicks as if someone had struck the rock with a collection of hammers
the sound repeated itself a half second later
he looked in the direction of the noise as did saphira
a huge twisted shape hurtled out of the lancet passageway
eyes black bulging rimless
a beak seven feet long
batlike wings
the torso naked hairless rippling with muscle
claws like iron spikes
saphira lurched as she tried to evade the lethrblaka but to no avail
the creature crashed into her right side with what felt to eragon like the strength and fury of an avalanche
what exactly happened next he knew not for the impact sent him tumbling through space without so much as a half formed thought in his jumbled brain
his blind flight ended as abruptly as it began when something hard and flat rammed against the back of him and he dropped to the floor banging his head a second time
that last collision drove the remaining air clean out of eragon is lungs
stunned he lay curled on his side gasping and struggling to regain a semblance of control over his unresponsive limbs
the concern in her voice fueled eragon is efforts as nothing else could
as life returned to his arms and legs he reached out and grasped his staff from where it had fallen beside him
he planted the spike mounted on the staff is lower end into a nearby crack and pulled himself up the hawthorn rod and onto his feet
he swayed
a swarm of crimson sparks danced before him
the situation was so confusing he hardly knew where to look first
saphira and the lethrblaka rolled across the cave kicking and clawing and snapping at each other with enough force to gouge the rock beneath them
the clamor of their fight must have been unimaginably loud but to eragon they grappled in silence his ears did not work
still he felt the vibrations through the soles of his feet as the colossal beasts thrashed from side to side threatening to crush anyone who came near them
a torrent of blue fire erupted from between saphira is jaws and bathed the left side of the lethrblaka is head in a ravening inferno hot enough to melt steel
the flames curved around the lethrblaka without harming it
undeterred the monster pecked at saphira is neck forcing her to stop and defend herself
fast as an arrow loosed from a bow the second lethrblaka darted out of the lancet passageway pounced upon saphira is flank and opening its narrow beak uttered a horrible withering shriek that made eragon is scalp prickle and a cold lump of dread form in his gut
