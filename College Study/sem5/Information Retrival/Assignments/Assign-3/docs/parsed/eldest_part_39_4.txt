the amount of information was overwhelming
out of pure habit his mind would snatch one subject or another from the torrent excluding all the rest before he noticed his lapse and wrenched himself back into a state of passive receptivity
the cycle repeated itself every few seconds
despite that he was able to improve his understanding of the ants world
he got his first clue as to their genders when he deduced that the huge ant in the heart of their underground lair was laying eggs one every minute or so which made it her a female
and when he accompanied a group of the red ants up the stem of their rosebush he got a vivid demonstration of the kind of enemies they faced something darted out from underneath a leaf and killed one of the ants he was bound to
it was hard for him to guess exactly what the creature was since the ants only saw fragments of it and in any case they placed more emphasis on smell than vision
if they had been people he would have said that they were attacked by a terrifying monster the size of a dragon which had jaws as powerful as the spiked portcullis at teirm and could move with whiplash speed
the ants ringed in the monster like grooms working to capture a runaway horse
they darted at it with a total lack of fear nipping at its knobbed legs and withdrawing an instant before they were caught in the monster is iron pincers
more and more ants joined the throng
they worked together to overpower the intruder never faltering even when two were caught and killed and when several of their brethren fell off the stem to the ground below
it was a desperate battle with neither side willing to give quarter
only escape or victory would save the combatants from a horrible death
eragon followed the fray with breathless anticipation awed by the ants bravery and how they continued to fight in spite of injuries that would incapacitate a human
their feats were heroic enough to be sung about by bards throughout the land
eragon was so engrossed by the contest that when the ants finally prevailed he loosed an elated cry so loud it roused the birds from their roosts among the trees
out of curiosity he returned his attention to his own body then walked to the rosebush to view the dead monster for himself
what he saw was an ordinary brown spider with its legs curled into a fist being transported by the ants down to their nest for food
he started to leave but then realized that once again he had neglected to keep watch over the myriad other insects and animals in the glade
he closed his eyes and whirled through the minds of several dozen beings doing his best to memorize as many interesting details as he could
it was a poor substitute for prolonged observation but he was hungry and he had already exhausted his assigned hour
when eragon rejoined oromis in his hut the elf asked how went it
master i could listen night and day for the next twenty years and still not know everything that goes on in the forest
oromis raised an eyebrow
you have made ** after eragon described what he had witnessed oromis said but still not enough i fear
you must work harder eragon
i know you can
you are intelligent and persistent and you have the potential to be a great rider
as difficult as it is you have to learn to put aside your troubles and concentrate entirely on the task at hand
find peace within yourself and let your actions flow from there
no this is not your best
we shall recognize your best when it ** he paused thoughtfully
perhaps it would help if you had a fellow student to compete with
then we might see your best
i will think on the matter
from his cupboards oromis produced a loaf of freshly baked bread a wood jar of hazelnut butter which the elves used in place of actual butter and a pair of bowls that he ladled full of a vegetable stew that had been simmering in a pot hung over a bed of coals in the corner fireplace
eragon looked at the stew with distaste he was sick of the elves fare
he longed for meat fish or fowl something hearty that he could sink his teeth into not this endless parade of plants
