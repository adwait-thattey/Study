the day came when eragon went to the glade beyond oromis is hut seated himself on the polished white stump in the center of the mossy hollow and when he opened his mind to observe the creatures around him sensed not just the birds beasts and insects but also the plants of the forest
the plants possessed a different type of consciousness than animals slow deliberate and decentralized but in their own way just as cognizant of their surroundings as eragon himself was
the faint pulse of the plants awareness bathed the galaxy of stars that wheeled behind his eyes each bright spark representing a life in a soft omnipresent glow
even the most barren soil teemed with organisms the land itself was alive and sentient
intelligent life he concluded existed everywhere
as eragon immersed himself in the thoughts and feelings of the beings around him he was able to attain a state of inner peace so profound that during that time he ceased to exist as an individual
he allowed himself to become a nonentity a void a receptacle for the voices of the world
nothing escaped his attention for his attention was focused on nothing
hewas the forest and its inhabitants
is that what a god feels like wondered eragon when he returned to himself
he left the glade sought out oromis in his hut and knelt before the elf saying master i have done as you told me to
i listened until i heard no more
oromis paused in his writing and with a thoughtful expression looked at eragon
tell ** for an hour and a half eragon waxed eloquent about every aspect of the plants and animals that populated the glade until oromis raised his hand and said i am convinced you heard all there was to hear
but did you understand it all
that is as it should be
comprehension will come with age
well done eragon finiarel
well done indeed
if you were my student in ilirea before galbatorix rose to power you would have just graduated from your apprenticeship and would be considered a full member of our order and accorded the same rights and privileges as even the oldest ** oromis pushed himself up out of his chair and then remained standing in place swaying
lend me your shoulder eragon and help me outside
my limbs betray my will
hurrying to his master is side eragon supported the elf is slight weight as oromis hobbled to the brook that rushed headlong toward the edge of the crags of tel naeir
now that you have reached this stage in your education i can teach you one of the greatest secrets of magic a secret that even galbatorix may not know
it is your best hope of matching his ** the elf is gaze sharpened
what is the cost of magic eragon
energy
a spell costs the same amount of energy as it would to complete the task through mundane means
oromis nodded
and where does the energy come from
eragon is mind raced as he considered the awesome implications of oromis is question
you mean it can come from other sources
that is exactly what happens whenever saphira assists you with a spell
yes but she and i share a unique connection protested eragon
our bond is the reason i can draw upon her strength
to do that with someone else i would have to enter
he trailed off as he realized what oromis was driving at
you would have to enter the consciousness of the being or beings who was going to provide the energy said oromis completing eragon is thought
today you proved that you can do just that with even the smallest form of life
now
he stopped and pressed a hand against his chest as he coughed then continued i want you to extract a sphere of water from the stream using only the energy you can glean from the forest around you
as eragon reached out to the nearby plants and animals he felt oromis is mind brush against his own the elf watching and judging his progress
frowning with concentration eragon endeavored to eke the needed force from the environment and hold it within himself until he was ready to release the magic
** do not take it from ** i am weak enough as is
startled eragon realized that he had included oromis in his search
i am sorry master he said chastised
