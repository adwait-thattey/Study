the wind is soft the river deep
the trees are tall the birds do sleep
laugh at woe and laugh at foe
the hour has arrived for joy to reap
when nari finished eragon released his pent up breath
he had never heard such a voice before it felt as if the elf had revealed his essence his very soul
that was beautiful nari vodhr
a rough composition argetlam demurred nari
but i thank you nevertheless
thorv grunted
very pretty master elf
however there are matters more serious than reciting verse that we must attend to
are we to accompany eragon farther
no said arya quickly drawing looks from the other elves
you may return home in the morning
we will assure that eragon reaches ellesmera
thorv dipped his head
then our task is complete
as eragon lay on the bedding the elves had arranged for him he strained his ears to catch arya is speech which drifted from one of the huts
though she used many unfamiliar words in the ancient language he deduced that she was explaining to their hosts how she had lost saphira is egg and the events since
a long silence followed after she stopped then an elf said it is good that you have returned arya drottningu
islanzadi was sorely wounded by grief when you were captured and the egg was stolen and by urgals no ** she was and is sick at heart
hush edurna
hush chided another
dvergar are small but they have sharp ears and i am sure these will report to hrothgar
then their voices dropped and eragon could discern no more from the murmur of voices which melded into the whisper of leaves as he drifted to sleep the elf is song repeating endlessly through his dreams
the scent of flowers was heavy in the air when eragon woke to behold a sun drenched du weldenvarden
above him arched a mottled panoply of drifting leaves supported by the thick trunks that buried themselves in the dry bare ground
only moss lichen and a few low shrubs survived in the pervasive green shade
the scarcity of underbrush made it possible to see for great distances between the knotted pillars and to walk about freely beneath the dappled ceiling
rolling to his feet eragon found thorv and his guards packed and ready to leave
orik is donkey was tied behind ekksvar is steed
eragon approached thorv and said thank you all of you for protecting me and saphira
please convey our gratitude to undin
thorv pressed his fist to his chest
i will carry your ** he hesitated and looked back at the huts
elves are a queer race full of light and dark
in the morning they drink with you in the evening they stab you
keep thine back to a wall shadeslayer
capricious they are
** thorv gestured toward the river
they plan to travel up eldor lake in boats
what will you do with thine horse we could return him to tarnag with us and from there to tronjheim
** cried eragon with dismay
he had always planned to bring snowfire to ellesmera
it was convenient to have a horse whenever saphira was away or in places too confined for her bulk
he fingered the sparse bristles along his jaw
that is a kind offer
will you make sure snowfire is well cared for i could not bear it if anything were to happen to him
on mine honor pledged thorv you will return to find him fat and sleek
eragon fetched snowfire and transferred the stallion his saddle and his grooming supplies into thorv is care
he bade each of the warriors farewell then he saphira and orik watched the dwarves ride back along the trail they had arrived on
returning to the huts eragon and the remainder of his party followed the elves to a thicket on the edge of the edda river
there docked on either side of a boulder were two white canoes with vines carved along their sides
eragon boarded the nearest boat and stowed his pack beneath his feet
he was amazed by how light the craft was he could have lifted it with a single hand
even more astounding the hulls appeared to be composed of birch bark panels melded into a seamless whole
curious he touched the side
the bark was hard and taut like stretched parchment and cool from its contact with the water
he rapped it with a knuckle
the fibrous shell reverberated like a muted drum
