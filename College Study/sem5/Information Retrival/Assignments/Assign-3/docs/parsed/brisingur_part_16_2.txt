agreed
now can we please abandon such weighty conversation i have become thoroughly exhausted with thoughts of fate destiny justice and other equally gloomy topics over the past few days
as far as i am concerned philosophic questioning is just as likely to make you confused and depressed as it is to improve your condition
swiveling his head eragon surveyed the plain and sky searching for the distinctive blue glitter of saphira is scales
where are you i can feel you are nearby but i can not see you
with a bugle of joy saphira dove out of the belly of a cloud several thousand feet overhead spiraling toward the ground with her wings tucked close to her body
opening her fearsome jaws she released a billow of fire which streamed back over her head and neck like a burning mane
eragon laughed and held his arms outstretched to her
the horses of the patrol galloping toward him and arya shied at the sight and sound of saphira and bolted in the opposite direction while their riders frantically tried to rein them in
i had hoped we could enter the camp without attracting undue attention arya said but i suppose i should have realized we could not be unobtrusive with saphira around
a dragon is hard to ignore
i heard that said saphira spreading her wings and landing with a thunderous crash
her massive thighs and shoulders rippled as she absorbed the force of the impact
a blast of air struck eragon is face and the earth shuddered underneath him
he flexed his knees to maintain his balance
folding her wings so they lay flat upon her back she said i can be stealthy if i want
then she cocked her head and blinked the tip of her tail whipping from side to side
but i do not want to be stealthy ** today i am a dragon not a frightened pigeon trying to avoid being seen by a hunting falcon
when are you not a dragon asked eragon as he ran toward her
light as a feather he leaped from her left foreleg to her shoulder and thence to the hollow at the base of her neck that was his usual seat
settling into place he put his hands on either side of her warm neck feeling the rise and fall of her banded muscles as she breathed
he smiled again with a profound sense of contentment
this is where i belong here with you
his legs vibrated as saphira hummed with satisfaction her deep rumbling following a strange subtle melody he did not recognize
greetings saphira said arya and twisted her hand over her chest in the elves gesture of respect
crouching low and bending her long neck saphira touched arya upon the brow with the tip of her snout as she had when she blessed elva in farthen dur and said greetings alfa kona
welcome and may the wind rise under your wings
she spoke to arya with the same tone of affection that until then she had reserved for eragon as if she now considered arya part of their small family and worthy of the same regard and intimacy as they shared
her gesture surprised eragon but after an initial flare of jealousy he approved
saphira continued speaking i am grateful to you for helping eragon to return without harm
if he had been captured i do not know what i would have done
your gratitude means much to me said arya and bowed
as for what you would have done if galbatorix had seized eragon why you would have rescued him and i would have accompanied you even if it was to uru baen itself
yes i like to think i would have rescued you eragon said saphira turning her neck to look at him but i worry that i would have surrendered to the empire in order to save you no matter the consequences for alagaesia
then she shook her head and kneaded the soil with her claws
ah these are pointless meanderings
you are here and safe and that is the true shape of the world
to while away the day contemplating evils that might have been is to poison the happiness we already have
at that moment a patrol galloped toward them and halting thirty yards away because of their nervous horses asked if they might escort the three to nasuada
one of the men dismounted and gave his steed to arya and then as a group they advanced toward the sea of tents to the southwest
