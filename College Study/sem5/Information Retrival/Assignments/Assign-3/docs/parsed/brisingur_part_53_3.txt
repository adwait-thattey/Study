a sword for all occasions of middling length but for the hilt which shall be longer than average
a sword for killing galbatorix said eragon
rhunon nodded
and as such it must be well protected against magic
her chin sank to her chest again
armor has improved a great deal in the past century so the tip will need to be narrower than i used to make them the better to pierce plate and mail and to slip into the gaps between the various pieces
** from a pouch by her side rhunon withdrew a knotted piece of twine with which she took numerous measurements of eragon is hands and arms
afterward she retrieved a wrought iron poker from the forge and tossed it toward eragon
he caught it with one hand and raised an eyebrow at the elf woman
she motioned toward him with a finger and said go on now
up on your feet and let me see how you move with a sword
walking out from under the roof of the open walled forge eragon obliged her by demonstrating several of the forms brom had taught him
after a minute he heard the clink of metal on stone then rhunon coughed and said oh this is ** she stepped in front of eragon holding another poker
her brow furrowed with a fierce scowl as she raised the poker before her in a salute and shouted have at you **
rhunon is heavy poker whistled through the air as she swung at him with a strong slashing blow
dancing to the side eragon parried the attack
the poker jumped in his hand as the two rods of metal collided
for a brief while he and rhunon sparred
although it was obvious she had not practiced her swordsmanship for some time eragon still found her a formidable opponent
at last they were forced to stop because the soft iron of the pokers had bent until the rods were as crooked as the branches of a yew tree
rhunon collected eragon is poker then carried the two mangled pieces of metal over to a pile of broken tools
when she returned the elf woman lifted her chin and said now i know exactly what shape your sword should have
but how will you make it
a twinkle of amusement appeared in rhunon is eyes
i wo not
you shall make the sword instead of me shadeslayer
eragon gaped at her for a moment then sputtered and said me but i was never apprenticed to a blacksmith or a bladesmith
i have not the skill to forge even a common brush knife
the twinkle in rhunon is eyes brightened
nevertheless you shall be the one to make this sword
but how will you stand beside me and give me orders as i hammer the metal
hardly said rhunon
no i shall guide your actions from within your mind so that your hands may do what mine cannot
it is not a perfect solution but i can think of no other means of evading my oath that will also allow me to ply my craft
eragon frowned
if you move my hands for me how is that any different from making the sword yourself
rhunon is expression darkened and in a brusque voice she said do you want this sword or not shadeslayer
then refrain from pestering me with such questions
making the sword through you is different because i think it is different
if i believed otherwise then my oath would prevent me from participating in the process
so unless you wish to return to the varden empty handed you would be wise to remain silent on the subject
lifting her front leg saphira stamped upon the rippled beam of brightsteel with all her strength
the earth shook and the brightsteel cracked in several places
three more times saphira stamped upon the metal before rhunon was satisfied with the results
the elf woman gathered up the sharp lumps of metal in her apron and carried them to a low table next to her forge
there she sorted the metal according to its hardness which or so she told eragon she was able to determine by the color and texture of the fractured metal
some is too hard and some is too soft she said and while i could remedy that if i wanted to it would require another heating
so we will only use the pieces that are already suitable for a sword
on the edges of the sword will go a slightly harder steel she touched a cluster of pieces that had a brilliant sparkling grain the better to take a keen edge
