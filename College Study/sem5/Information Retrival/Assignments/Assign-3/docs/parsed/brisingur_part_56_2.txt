saphira descended toward the clearing by oromis is pinewood house where glaedr and oromis stood waiting for them
eragon was startled to see that glaedr was wearing a saddle nestled between two of the towering spikes on his back and that oromis was garbed in heavy traveling robes of blue and green over which he wore a corselet of golden scale armor as well as bracers upon his arms
a tall diamond shaped shield was slung across his back an archaic helm rested in the crook of his left arm and around his waist was belted his bronze colored sword naegling
with a gust of wind from her wings saphira alighted upon the sward of grass and clover
she flicked out her tongue tasting the air as eragon slid to the ground
are you going to fly with us to the varden she asked
the tip of her tail twitched with excitement
we shall fly with you as far as the edge of du weldenvarden but there our paths must part said oromis
disappointed eragon asked will you return to ellesmera then
oromis shook his head
no eragon
then we shall continue onward to the city of gil ead
saphira hissed with surprise a sentiment eragon shared
why to gil ead he asked bewildered
because islanzadi and her army have marched there from ceunon and they are about to lay siege to the city said glaedr
the strange gleaming structures of his mind brushed against eragon is consciousness
but do not you and oromis wish to keep your existence hidden from the empire saphira asked
oromis closed his eyes for a moment his expression withdrawn and enigmatic
the time for hiding has passed saphira
glaedr and i have taught the two of you everything we could in the brief while you were able to study under us
it was a paltry education compared with that you would have received of old but given how events press on us we are fortunate to have been able to teach you as much as we did
glaedr and i are satisfied that you now know everything that might help you to defeat galbatorix
therefore since it seems unlikely that either of you will have a chance to return here for further instruction before the conclusion of this war and since it seems even more unlikely that there shall ever be another dragon and rider for us to instruct while galbatorix still bestrides the warm earth we have decided that we no longer have any reason to remain sequestered in du weldenvarden
it is more important that we help islanzadi and the varden overthrow galbatorix than we tarry here in idle comfort while we wait for another rider and dragon to seek us out
when galbatorix learns that we are still alive it shall undermine his confidence for he shall not know if other dragons and riders have survived his attempt to exterminate them
also knowledge of our existence shall bolster the spirits of the dwarves and the varden and counteract any adverse effects murtagh and thorn is appearance on the burning plains may have had upon the resolution of their warriors
and it may well increase the number of recruits nasuada receives from the empire
eragon glanced at naegling and said surely though master you do not intend to venture into battle yourselves
and why should we not inquired oromis tilting his head to one side
since he did not want to offend oromis or glaedr eragon was uncertain how to respond
at last he said forgive me master but how can you fight when you cannot cast spells that require more than a small amount of energy and what of the spasms you sometimes suffer if one were to strike in the middle of a battle it could prove fatal
oromis replied as you ought to know well by now mere strength rarely decides the victor when two magicians duel
even so i have all the strength i need here in the jewel of my ** and he reached across his body and placed the palm of his right hand on the yellow diamond that formed the pommel of naegling
for over a hundred years glaedr and i have stored every iota of our excess strength in this diamond and others have added their strength to the pool as well twice a week several elves from ellesmera visit me here and transfer as much of their life force into the gem as they can without killing themselves
