propelled by the breeze a spider hanging from a gossamer strand of silk drifted past eragon rising and falling on the invisible eddies of air
when the spider had floated out of view eragon said the first time we visited tronjheim the fortuneteller angela told me that it was brom is wyrd to fail at everything he attempted except for killing morzan
oromis inclined his head
one might think that
another might conclude that brom achieved many great and difficult things
it depends upon how you choose to view the world
the words of fortunetellers are rarely easy to decipher
it has been my experience that their predictions are never conducive to peace of mind
if you wish to be happy eragon think not of what is to come nor of that which you have no control over but rather of the now and of that which you are able to change
a thought occurred to eragon then
blagden he said referring to the white raven who was queen islanzadi is companion
he knows about brom as well does not he
one of oromis is sharp eyebrows lifted
does he i never spoke of it to him
he is a fickle creature and not to be relied upon
the day saphira and i left for the burning plains he recited a riddle to me
i can not remember every line but it was something about one of two being one while one might be two
i think he might have been hinting that murtagh and i only share a single parent
it is not impossible said oromis
blagden was here in ellesmera when brom told me about you
i would not be surprised if that sharp beaked thief happened to be perched in a nearby tree during our conversation
eavesdropping is an unfortunate habit of his
it might also be that his riddle was the result of one of his sporadic fits of foresight
a moment later glaedr stirred and oromis turned and glanced back at the golden dragon
the elf rose from his chair with a graceful motion saying fruit nuts and bread are fine fare but after your trip you should have something more substantial to fill your belly
i have a soup that needs tending simmering in my hut but please do not bestir yourself
i will bring it to you when it is ** his footsteps soft upon the grass oromis walked to his bark covered house and disappeared inside
as the carved door closed glaedr huffed out his breath and closed his eyes seeming to fall asleep
and all was silent save the rustle of the wind tossed branches
