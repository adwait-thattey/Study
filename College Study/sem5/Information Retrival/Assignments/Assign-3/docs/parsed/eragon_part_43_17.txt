a lone figure stood behind them arya
a leather strip encircled her brow restraining her voluminous black hair which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous cascade
her slender sword was at her hip her bow on her back
plain black leather clothed her shapely frame poor raiment for one so fair
she was taller than most men and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed
an unmarked face reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured
arya is blazing emerald eyes were fixed on the twins who had turned pale with fright
she approached on silent footsteps and said in soft menacing tones ** shame to ask of him what only a master can do
shame that you should use such methods
shame that you told ajihad you did not know eragon is abilities
he is competent
now ** arya frowned dangerously her slanted eyebrows meeting like lightning bolts in a sharp v and pointed at the ring in eragon is hand
** she exclaimed thunderously
the silver shimmered and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it
the two were identical except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed white hot
at the sight of it the twins spun on their heels and fled robes flapping wildly
the insubstantial ring vanished from eragon is hand leaving the circlet of silver behind
orik and fredric were on their feet eyeing arya warily
saphira crouched ready for action
the elf surveyed them all
her angled eyes paused on eragon
then she turned and strode toward the heart of the training field
the warriors ceased their sparring and looked at her with wonder
within a few moments the entire field fell silent in awe of her presence
eragon was inexorably dragged forward by his own fascination
saphira spoke but he was oblivious to her comments
a large circle formed around arya
looking only at eragon she proclaimed i claim the right of trial by arms
draw your sword
but not i think to harm you replied saphira slowly
she nudged him with her ** and acquit yourself well
i will watch
eragon reluctantly stepped forward
he did not want to do this when he was exhausted from magic use and when there were so many people watching
besides arya could be in no shape for sparring
it had only been two days since she had received tunivor is ** will soften my blows so i do not hurt her he decided
they faced each other across the circle of warriors
arya drew her sword with her left hand
the weapon was thinner than eragon is but just as long and sharp
he slid zar roc out of its polished sheath and held the red blade point down by his side
for a long moment they stood motionless elf and human watching each other
it flashed through eragon is mind that this was how many of his fights with brom had started
he moved forward cautiously
with a blur of motion arya jumped at him slashing at his ribs
eragon reflexively parried the attack and their swords met in a shower of sparks
zar roc was batted aside as if it were no more than a fly
the elf did not take advantage of the opening however but spun to her right hair whipping through the air and struck at his other side
he barely stopped the blow and backpedaled frantically stunned by her ferocity and speed
belatedly eragon remembered brom is warning that even the weakest elf could easily overpower a human
he had about as much chance of defeating arya as he did durza
she attacked again swinging at his head
he ducked under the razor sharp edge
but then why was she
toying with him for a few long seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it then he realized she wants to know how proficient i am
understanding that he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew
he flowed from one pose to another recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible way
but no matter how inventive he was arya is sword always stopped his
she matched his actions with effortless grace
engaged in a fiery dance their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades
at times they nearly touched taut skin only a hair is breadth away but then momentum would whirl them apart and they would withdraw for a second only to join again
