ajihad stood clasped his hands behind his back and absently studied one of the bookshelves
after a time he returned to the desk
brom is death is a terrible loss
he was a close friend of mine and a powerful ally of the varden
he saved us from destruction many times through his bravery and intelligence
even now when he is gone he is provided us with the one thing that can ensure our success you
but what can you expect me to accomplish asked eragon
i will explain it in full said ajihad but there are more urgent matters to be dealt with first
the news of the urgals alliance with the empire is extremely serious
if galbatorix is gathering an urgal army to destroy us the varden will be hard pressed to survive even though many of us are protected here in farthen dur
that a rider even one as evil as galbatorix would consider a pact with such monsters is indeed proof of madness
i shudder to think of what he promised them in return for their fickle loyalty
and then there is the shade
can you describe him
eragon nodded
he was tall thin and very pale with red eyes and hair
he was dressed all in black
what of his sword did you see it asked ajihad intensely
did it have a long scratch on the blade
yes said eragon surprised
how did you know
because i put it there while trying to cut out his heart said ajihad with a grim smile
his name is durza one of the most vicious and cunning fiends to ever stalk this land
he is the perfect servant for galbatorix and a dangerous enemy for us
you say that you killed him
how was it done
eragon remembered it vividly
murtagh shot him twice
the first arrow caught him in the shoulder the second one struck him between the eyes
i was afraid of that said ajihad frowning
you did not kill him
shades can only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart
anything short of that will cause them to vanish and then reappear elsewhere in spirit form
it is an unpleasant process but durza will survive and return stronger than ever
a moody silence settled over them like a foreboding thunderhead
then ajihad stated you are an enigma eragon a quandary that no one knows how to solve
everyone knows what the varden want or the urgals or even galbatorix but no one knows whatyou want
and that makes you dangerous especially to galbatorix
he fears you because he does not know what you will do next
do the varden fear me asked eragon quietly
no said ajihad carefully
we are hopeful
but if that hope proves false then yes we will be ** eragon looked down
you must understand the unusual nature of your position
there are factions who want you to serve their interests and no one else is
the moment you entered farthen dur their influence and power began tugging on you
ajihad chuckled though his eyes were sharp
including mine
there are certain things you should know first is how saphira is egg happened to appear in the spine
did brom ever tell you what was done with her egg after he brought it here
no said eragon glancing at saphira
she blinked and flicked her tongue at him
ajihad tapped his desk before beginning
when brom first brought the egg to the varden everyone was deeply interested in its fate
we had thought the dragons were exterminated
the dwarves were solely concerned with making sure that the future rider would be an ally though some of them were opposed to having a new rider at all while the elves and varden had a more personal stake in the matter
the reason was simple enough throughout history all the riders have been either elven or human with the majority being elven
there has never been a dwarf rider
because of galbatorix is betrayals the elves were reluctant to let any of the varden handle the egg for fear that the dragon inside would hatch for a human with similar instabilities
it was a challenging situation as both sides wanted the rider for their own
the dwarves only aggravated the problem by arguing obstinately with both the elves and us whenever they had the chance
tensions escalated and before long threats were made that were later regretted
it was then that brom suggested a compromise that allowed all sides to save face
