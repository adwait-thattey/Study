no matter you also might not be able to do it
either way before you spend time finding out you should first devote yourself to the art of defense
his cousin cocked an eyebrow
how
choose something a sound an image an emotion anything and let it swell within your mind until it blots out any other thoughts
it is not as easy as you think
go on take a stab at it
when you re ready let me know and i will see how well you ve done
several moments passed
then at a flick of roran is fingers eragon launched his consciousness toward his cousin eager to discover what he had accomplished
the full strength of eragon is mental ray rammed into a wall composed of roran is memories of katrina and was stopped
he could take no ground find no entrance or purchase nor undermine the impenetrable barrier that stood before him
at that instant roran is entire identity was based upon his feelings for katrina his defenses exceeded any eragon had previously encountered for roran is mind was devoid of anything else eragon could grasp hold of and use to gain control over his cousin
then roran shifted his left leg and the wood underneath released a harsh squeal
with that the wall eragon had hurled himself against fractured into dozens of pieces as a host of competing thoughts distracted roran what was
** do not pay attention to it he will break through
katrina remember katrina
ignore eragon
the night she agreed to marry me the smell of the grass and her hair
is that him ** ** do not
taking advantage of roran is confusion eragon rushed forward and by the force of his will immobilized roran before he could shield himself again
you understand the basic concept said eragon then withdrew from roran is mind and said out loud but you have to learn to maintain your concentration even when you re in the middle of a battle
you must learn to think without thinking
to empty yourself of all hopes and worries save that one idea that is your armor
something the elves taught me which i have found helpful is to recite a riddle or a piece of a poem or song
having an action that you can repeat over and over again makes it much easier to keep your mind from straying
i will work on it promised roran
in a quiet voice eragon said you really love her do not you it was more a statement of truth and wonder than a question the answer being self evident and one he felt uncertain making
romance was not a topic eragon had broached with his cousin before notwithstanding the many hours they had devoted in years past to debating the relative merits of the young women in and around carvahall
how did it happen
i liked her
she liked me
what importance are the details
come now said eragon
i was too angry to ask before you left for therinsford and we have not seen each other again until just four days ago
i am curious
the skin around roran is eyes pulled and wrinkled as he rubbed his temples
there is not much to tell
i ve always been partial to her
it meant little before i was a man but after my rites of passage i began to wonder whom i would marry and whom i wanted to become the mother of my children
during one of our visits to carvahall i saw katrina stop by the side of loring is house to pick a moss rose growing in the shade of the eaves
she smiled as she looked at the flower
it was such a tender smile and so happy i decided right then that i wanted to make her smile like that again and again and that i wanted to look at that smile until the day i ** tears gleamed in roran is eyes but they did not fall and a second later he blinked and they vanished
i fear i have failed in that regard
after a respectful pause eragon said you courted her then
you ask like one who seeks instruction
come now yourself said roran
i know when you re lying
you get that big foolish grin and your ears turn red
the elves may have given you a new face but that part of you has not changed
what is it that exists between you and arya
the strength of roran is perception disturbed eragon
** the moon has addled your brain
be honest
you dote upon her words as if each one were a diamond and your gaze lingers upon her as if you were starving and she a grand feast arrayed an inch beyond your reach
