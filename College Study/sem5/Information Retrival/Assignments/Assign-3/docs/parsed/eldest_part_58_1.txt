eragon packed his belongings in less than five minutes
he took the saddle oromis had given them strapped it onto saphira then slung his bags over her back and buckled them down
saphira tossed her head nostrils flared and said i will wait for you at the field
with a roar she launched herself from the tree house unfolding her blue wings in midair and flew off skimming the forest canopy
quick as an elf eragon ran to tialdari hall where he found orik sitting in his usual corner playing a game of runes
the dwarf greeted him with a hearty slap on the arm
** what brings you here at this time of the morn i thought you d be off banging swords with vanir
saphira and i are leaving said eragon
orik stopped with his mouth open then narrowed his eyes going serious
you ve had news
i will tell you about it later
do you want to come
a wide smile broke across orik is hairy face
you d have to clap me in irons before i d stay behind
i ve done nothing in ellesmera but grow fat and lazy
a bit of excitement will do me good
when do we leave
as soon as possible
gather your things and meet us at the sparring grounds
can you scrounge up a week is worth of provisions for the two of us
the skin above orik is beard turned pale
we dwarves do not do well with heights eragon
we do not do well at all
it d be better if we could ride horses like we did coming here
eragon shook his head
that would take too long
besides it is easy to ride saphira
she will catch you if you ** orik grunted appearing both queasy and unconvinced
leaving the hall eragon sped through the sylvan city until he rejoined saphira and then they flew to the crags of tel naeir
oromis was sitting upon glaedr is right forearm when they landed in the clearing
the dragon is scales gilded the landscape with countless chips of golden light
neither elf nor dragon stirred
descending from saphira is back eragon bowed
master glaedr
master oromis
glaedr said you have taken it upon yourself to return to the varden have you not
eragon is sense of betrayal overcame his self restraint
why did you hide the truth from us are you so determined to keep us here that you must resort to such underhand trickery the varden are about to be attacked and you did not even mention **
calm as ever oromis asked do you wish to hear why
very much master said saphira before eragon could respond
in private she scolded him growling be polite
we withheld the tidings for two reasons
chief among them was that we ourselves did not know until nine days past that the varden were threatened and the true size location and movements of the empire is troops remained concealed from us until three days after that when lord dathedr pierced the spells galbatorix used to deceive our scrying
that still does not explain why you said nothing of ** eragon scowled
not only that but once you discovered that the varden were in danger why did not islanzadi rouse the elves to fight are we not allies
shehas roused the elves eragon
the forest echoes with the ring of hammers the tramp of armored boots and the grief of those who are about to be parted
for the first time in a century our race is set to emerge from du weldenvarden and challenge our greatest foe
the time has come for elves to once more walk openly in ** gently oromis added you have been distracted of late eragon and i understand why
now you must look beyond yourself
the world demands your attention
shamefaced all eragon could say was i am sorry ** he remembered blagden is words and allowed himself a bitter smile
i am as blind as a bat
hardly eragon
you have done well considering the enormous responsibilities we have asked you to ** oromis looked at him gravely
we expect to receive a missive from nasuada in the next few days requesting assistance from islanzadi and that you rejoin the varden
i intended to inform you of the varden is predicament then when you would still have enough time to reach surda before swords are drawn
if i told you earlier you would have been honor bound to abandon your training and rush to the defense of your liegelord
that is why i and islanzadi held our tongues
