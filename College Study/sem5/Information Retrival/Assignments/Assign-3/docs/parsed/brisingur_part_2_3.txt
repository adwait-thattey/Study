he confesses them to her but she rebuffs him and soon leaves to return to the varden
then the elves hold a ritual known as the agaeti blodhren or the blood oath celebration during which eragon goes through a magical transformation he is turned into an elf human hybrid not quite one not quite the other
as a result his scar is healed and he now has the same superhuman strength the elves have
his features are also altered so he appears slightly elvish
at this point eragon learns that the varden are on the brink of battle with the empire and are in dire need of him and saphira
while eragon has been away nasuada has moved the varden from farthen dur to surda a country south of the empire that still maintains its independence from galbatorix
eragon and saphira leave ellesmera along with orik after promising oromis and glaedr that they will return to complete their training as soon as they can
meanwhile eragon is cousin roran has been having his own adventures
galbatorix has sent the ra zac and a legion of imperial soldiers to carvahall looking to capture roran so as to use him against eragon
roran manages to escape into the nearby mountains
he and the other villagers attempt to drive the soldiers away
numerous villagers die in the process
when sloan the village butcher who hates roran and opposes roran is engagement to his daughter katrina betrays roran to the ra zac the beetle like creatures find and attack roran in the middle of the night in his bedroom
roran fights his way free but the ra zac capture katrina
roran convinces the people of carvahall to leave their village and seek refuge with the varden in surda
they set out westward for the coast in the hope that they can sail from there to surda
roran proves himself as a leader bringing them safely through the spine to the coast
in the port town of teirm they meet jeod who tells roran that eragon is a rider and explains what the ra zac were looking for in carvahall in the first place saphira
jeod offers to help roran and the villagers reach surda pointing out that once roran and the villagers are safely with the varden roran can enlist eragon is help in rescuing katrina
jeod and the villagers pirate a ship and sail toward surda
eragon and saphira reach the varden who are readying for battle
eragon learns what has become of the baby upon whom he bestowed the ill phrased blessing her name is elva and though chronologically she is still a baby she has the appearance of a four year old child and the voice and demeanor of a world weary adult
eragon is spell forces her to sense the pain of all the people she sees and compels her to protect them if she resists this urge she herself suffers
eragon saphira and the varden ride out to meet the empire is troops on the burning plains a large swath of land that smokes and smolders from underground peat fires
they are astonished when another rider appears astride a red dragon

now murtagh and his newly hatched dragon thorn are galbatorix is slaves and murtagh asserts that his oaths will never allow him to disobey the king though eragon pleads with him to abandon galbatorix and join the varden
murtagh is able to overwhelm eragon and saphira with an inexplicable display of strength
however he decides to free them because of their previous friendship
before murtagh leaves he takes zar roc from eragon claiming it is his inheritance as morzan is elder son
then he reveals that he is not morzan is only son eragon and murtagh are brothers both sons of selena morzan is consort
