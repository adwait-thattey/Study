eragon examined the minds of every person around him and saphira searching for magicians who might mean them harm but he found no other spellcaster besides the three they had already seen and the three were careful to keep their thoughts hidden from him
it concerned him that they did not seem to have rejoined the fight in any noticeable way
maybe they intend to abandon the city he said to saphira
would galbatorix let them leave in the middle of a battle
i doubt he wants to lose any of his spellcasters
maybe but we should still tread with care
who knows what they are planning
eragon shrugged
for now the best thing we can do is help the varden secure feinster as quickly as possible
she agreed and angled toward a skirmish in a nearby square
fighting in a city was different from fighting in the open as eragon and saphira were accustomed to
the narrow streets and close set buildings hampered saphira is movements and made it difficult to react when soldiers attacked even though eragon could sense the men approaching long before they arrived
their encounters with the soldiers devolved into dark and desperate struggles broken only by the occasional burst of fire or magic
more than once saphira wrecked the front of a house with a careless sweep of her tail
she and eragon always managed to escape permanent injury through a combination of luck skill and eragon is wards but the attacks made them even more cautious and tense than they normally were in battle
the fifth such confrontation left eragon so enraged that when the soldiers began to withdraw as they always did in the end he gave chase determined to kill every last one
they surprised him by swerving off the street and crashing through the barred door of a millinery shop
eragon followed leaping over the cracked wreckage of the door
the inside of the shop was pitch black and smelled like chicken feathers and stale perfume
he could have lit the shop with magic but since he knew the soldiers were at a greater disadvantage than he was he refrained
eragon felt their minds nearby and he could hear their ragged breathing but he was uncertain of what lay between him and them
he inched deeper into the inky shop feeling his way with his feet
he held his shield in front of him and brisingr over his head ready to strike
faint as a line of thread falling to the floor eragon heard an object flying through the air
he jerked backward and staggered as a mace or a hammer struck his shield breaking it into pieces
shouts erupted
a man knocked over a chair or a table and something shattered against a wall
eragon lashed out and felt brisingr sink into flesh and bury itself in bone
a weight dragged on the end of his sword
eragon yanked it free and the man he had struck collapsed across his feet
eragon dared a glance back at saphira who was waiting for him in the narrow street outside
only then did eragon see that there was a lantern mounted on an iron post beside the street and that the light it cast rendered him visible to the soldiers
he quickly moved from the open doorway and threw away the remnants of his shield
another crash echoed through the shop and there was a confusion of footsteps as the soldiers rushed out the back and up a flight of stairs
eragon scrambled after them
the second story was the living quarters of the family who owned the store below
several people screamed and a baby began to wail as eragon bounded through a maze of small rooms but he ignored them intent as he was on his prey
at last he cornered the soldiers in a cramped sitting room illuminated by a single flickering candle
eragon slew the four soldiers with four strokes of his sword wincing as their blood splattered him
he scavenged a new shield from one then paused and studied the corpses
it seemed rude to leave them lying in the middle of the sitting room so he threw them out a nearby window
on his way back to the stairs a figure stepped around a corner and stabbed a dagger toward eragon is ribs
the tip of the dagger stopped a fraction of an inch from eragon is side halted by his wards
