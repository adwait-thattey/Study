the bottom of isidar mithrim though what is now the top
skeg shook his head his lined face doleful
the force of the break all the pieces pushing against the face of the gem pushing away from arya and the dragon saphira pushing down toward you and that blackhearted shade
it cracked the petals of the rose into ever smaller fragments
and the rose argetlam the rose is the key to the gem
it is the most complex the most beautiful part of isidar mithrim
and it is in the most pieces
unless we can reassemble it every last speck where it ought to be we might as well give the gem to our jewelers and have them grind it into rings for our ** the words spilled out of skeg like water from an overflowing beaker
he shouted in dwarvish at a dwarf carrying a box across the chamber then tugged at his white beard and asked have you ever heard recounted argetlam the tale of how isidar mithrim was carved in the age of herran
eragon hesitated thinking back to his history lessons in ellesmera
i know it was durok who carved it
aye said skeg it was durok ornthrond eagle eye as you say in this tongue
it was not he who discovered isidar mithrim but it was he alone who extracted it from the surrounding stone he who carved it and he who polished it
fifty seven years he spent working on the star rose
the gem enthralled him as nothing else
every night he sat crouched over isidar mithrim until the wee hours of the morning as he was determined that the star rose should be not just art but something that would touch the hearts of all who gazed upon it and would earn him a seat of honor at the table of the gods
his devotion was such that in the thirty second year of his labors when his wife told him that either he had to share the burden of the project with his apprentices or she would leave his hall durok said not a word but turned his shoulder to her and continued grinding the contours of the petal he had begun earlier that year
durok worked on isidar mithrim until he was pleased with its every line and curve
then he dropped his polishing cloth took one step back from the star rose said guntera protect me it is done and fell dead on the ** skeg tapped his chest producing a hollow thump
his heart gave out for what else did he have to live for
that is what we are trying to reconstruct argetlam fifty seven years of ceaseless concentration by one of the finest artists our race has known
unless we can put isidar mithrim back together exactly the way it was we shall diminish durok is accomplishment for all who have yet to see the star ** knotting his right hand into a fist skeg bounced it off his thigh to emphasize his words
eragon leaned against the hip high railing in front of him and watched as five dwarves on the opposite side of the gem lowered a sixth dwarf who was bound in a rope harness until he hung inches above the sharp edges of the fractured sapphire
reaching inside his tunic the suspended dwarf removed a sliver of isidar mithrim from a leather wallet and grasping the sliver with a minuscule set of pincers fit it into a small gap in the gem below
if the coronation were held three days from now said eragon could you have isidar mithrim ready by then
skeg drummed the railing with all ten of his fingers tapping out a melody eragon failed to recognize
the dwarf said we would not rush so with isidar mithrim if not for the offer of your dragon
this haste is foreign to us argetlam
it is not our nature as it is humans to rush about like agitated ants
still we shall do our best to have isidar mithrim ready in time for the coronation
if that should be three days from now
well i should not be too hopeful of our prospects
but if it were later in the week i think we might be finished
eragon thanked skeg for his prediction then took his leave
with his guards trailing after him eragon walked to one of the many common eating halls in the city mountain a long low room with stone tables arranged in rows on one side and dwarves busying themselves about soapstone ovens on the other
there eragon dined on sourdough bread fish with white meat that the dwarves caught in underground lakes mushrooms and some sort of mashed tuber that he had eaten before in tronjheim but whose provenance he had yet to learn
