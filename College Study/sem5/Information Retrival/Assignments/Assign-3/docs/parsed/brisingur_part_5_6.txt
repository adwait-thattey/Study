the chitinous appendage snapped shut just short of his right eye
in a rather detached way eragon noticed that the ra zac is tongue was barbed and purple and writhed like a headless snake
bringing his hands together at the center of the staff eragon drove his arms forward striking the ra zac across its hollow chest and throwing the monster back several yards
it fell upon its hands and knees
eragon pivoted around roran whose left side was slick with blood and parried the sword of the other ra zac
he feinted beat the ra zac is blade and when the ra zac stabbed at his throat whirled the other half of the staff across his body and deflected the thrust
without pausing eragon lunged forward and planted the wooden end of the staff in the ra zac is abdomen
if eragon had been wielding zar roc he would have killed the ra zac then and there
as it was something cracked inside the ra zac and the creature went rolling across the cave for a dozen or more paces
it immediately popped up again leaving a smear of blue gore on the uneven rock
i need a sword thought eragon
he widened his stance as the two ra zac converged upon him he had no choice but to hold his ground and face their combined onslaught for he was all that stood between those hook clawed carrion crows and roran
he began to mouth the same spell that had proved itself against the lethrblaka but the ra zac executed high and low slashes before he could utter a syllable
the swords rebounded off the hawthorn with a dull bonk
they did not dent or otherwise mar the enchanted wood
left right up down
eragon did not think he acted and reacted as he exchanged a flurry of blows with the ra zac
the staff was ideal for fighting multiple opponents as he could strike and block with both ends and often simultaneously
that ability served him well now
he panted each breath short and quick
sweat dripped from his brow and gathered at the corners of his eyes and a layer greased his back and the undersides of his arms
the red haze of battle dimmed his vision and throbbed in response to the convulsions of his heart
he never felt so alive or afraid as he did when fighting
eragon is own wards were scant
since he had lavished the bulk of his attention on saphira and roran eragon is magical defenses soon failed and the smaller ra zac wounded him on the outside of his left knee
the injury was not life threatening but it was still serious for his left leg would no longer support his full weight
gripping the spike at the bottom eragon swung the staff like a club and bashed one ra zac upside the head
the ra zac collapsed but whether it was dead or only unconscious eragon could not tell
advancing upon the remaining ra zac he battered the creature is arms and shoulders and with a sudden twist knocked the sword out of its hand
before eragon could finish off the ra zac the blinded brokenwinged lethrblaka flew the width of the cave and slammed against the far wall knocking loose a shower of stone flakes from the ceiling
the sight and sound were so colossal they caused eragon roran and the ra zac to flinch and turn simply out of instinct
jumping after the crippled lethrblaka which she had just kicked saphira sank her teeth into the back of the creature is sinewy neck
the lethrblaka thrashed in one final effort to free itself and then saphira whipped her head from side to side and broke its spine
rising from her bloody kill saphira filled the cave with a savage roar of victory
the remaining lethrblaka did not hesitate
tackling saphira it dug its claws underneath the edges of her scales and pulled her into an uncontrolled tumble
together they rolled to the lip of the cave teetered for a half second and then dropped out of sight battling the whole way
it was a clever tactic for it carried the lethrblaka out of the range of eragon is senses and that which he could not sense he had difficulty casting a spell against
tend to yourself
this one wo not escape me
with a start eragon whirled around just in time to see the two ra zac vanish into the depths of the nearest tunnel the smaller supporting the larger
