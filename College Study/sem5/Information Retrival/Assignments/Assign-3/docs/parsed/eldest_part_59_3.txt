the captain hesitated
maybe maybe not
you d have t be stark raving mad to go nearer n five miles of that monster
pulling out his hammer roran banged it on the table leaving a dent a half inch deep
then i am stark raving ** he held uthar is gaze until the sailor shifted with discomfort
must i remind you we ve only gotten this far by doing what quibbling worrywarts said could not or should not be done we of carvahall dared to abandon our homes and cross the spine
jeod dared to imagine we could steal thedragon wing
what will you dare uthar if we can brave the eye and live to tell the tale you shall be hailed as one of the greatest mariners in history
now answer me and answer me well and true can this be done
uthar drew a hand over his face
when he spoke it was in a low voice as if roran is outburst had caused him to abandon all bluster
i do not know stronghammer
if we wait for the eye to subside the sloops may be so close to us that if we escape they d escape
an if the wind should falter we d be caught in the current unable to break free
as captain are you willing to attempt it neither jeod nor i can command thedragon wing in your place
long did uthar stare down at the charts one hand clasped over the other
he drew a line or two from their position and worked a table of figures that roran could make nothing of
at last he said i fear we sail to our doom but aye i will do my best to see us through
satisfied roran put away his hammer
so be it
the sloops continued to draw closer to thedragon wing over the course of the day
roran watched their progress whenever he could concerned that they would get near enough to attack before thedragon wing reached the eye
still uthar seemed able to outrun them at least for a little while longer
at uthar is orders roran and the other villagers worked to tidy up the ship after the storm and prepare for the ordeal that was to come
their work ended at nightfall when they extinguished every light on board in an attempt to confuse their pursuers as to thedragon wing is heading
the ruse succeeded in part for when the sun rose roran saw that the sloops had fallen back to the northwest another mile or so though they soon made up the lost distance
late that morning roran climbed the mainmast and pulled himself up into the crow is nest a hundred and thirty feet above the deck so high that the men below appeared no larger than his little finger
the water and sky seemed to rock perilously about him as thedragon wing heeled from side to side
taking out the spyglass he had brought with him roran put it to his eye and adjusted it until the sloops came into focus not four miles astern and approaching faster than he would have ** must have realized what we intend to do he thought
sweeping the glass around he searched the ocean for any sign of the boar is eye
he stopped as he descried a great disk of foam the size of an island gyrating from north to ** re late he thought a pit in his stomach
high tide had already passed and the boar is eye was gathering in speed and strength as the ocean withdrew from land
roran trained the glass over the edge of the crow is nest and saw that the knotted rope uthar had tied to the starboard side of the stern to detect when they entered the pull of the whirlpool now floated alongside thedragon wing instead of trailing behind as was usual
the one thing in their favor was that they were sailing with the eye is current and not against it
if it had been the other way around they would have had no choice but to wait until the tide turned
below roran heard uthar shout for the villagers to man the oars
a moment later thedragon wing sprouted two rows of poles along each side making the ship look like nothing more than a giant water strider
at the beat of an ox hide drum accompanied by bonden is rhythmic chant as he set the tempo the oars arched forward dipped into the sea of green and swept back across the surface of the water leaving white streaks of bubbles in their wake
thedragon wing accelerated quickly now moving faster than the sloops which were still outside the eye is influence
