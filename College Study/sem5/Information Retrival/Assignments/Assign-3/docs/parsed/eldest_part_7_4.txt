upheaval makes already difficult lives such as ours nigh impossible
what is more there have even been tales of
here the trapper paused and with a knowing expression tapped the side of his nose with his forefinger
tales of a new rider in ** he laughed then a big hearty laugh slapping his belly as he rocked back on the porch
roran laughed as well
stories of riders appeared every few years
they had excited his interest the first two or three times but he soon learned not to trust such accounts for they all came to naught
the rumors were nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of those who longed for a brighter future
he was about to head off when he noticed katrina standing by the corner of the tavern garbed in a long russet dress decorated with green ribbon
she gazed at him with the same intensity with which he gazed at her
going over he touched her on the shoulder and together they slipped away
they walked to the edge of carvahall where they stood looking at the stars
the heavens were brilliant shimmering with thousands of celestial fires
and arching above them from north to south was the glorious pearly band that streamed from horizon to horizon like diamond dust tossed from a pitcher
without looking at him katrina rested her head on roran is shoulder and asked how was your day
i returned ** he felt her stiffen against him
** his voice caught and he fell silent holding her tightly
the scent of her copper hair on his cheek was like an elixir of wine and spice and perfume
it seeped deep inside him warm and comforting
the house the barn the fields they re all being overrun
i would not have found them if i did not know where to look
she finally turned to face him stars flashing in her eyes sorrow on her face
oh ** she kissed him lips brushing his for a brief moment
you have endured so much loss and yet your strength has never failed you
will you return to your farm now
aye
farming is all i know
and what shall become of me
he hesitated
from the moment he began to court her an unspoken assumption that they would marry had existed between them
there had been no need to discuss his intentions they were as plain as the day was long and so her question unsettled him
it also felt improper to address the issue in such an open manner when he was not ready to tender an offer
it washis place to make the overtures first to sloan and then to katrina not hers
still he had to deal with her concern now that it had been expressed
katrina
i cannot approach your father as i had planned
he would laugh at me and rightly so
we have to wait
once i have a place for us to live and i ve collected my first harvest then he will listen to me
she faced the sky once more and whispered something so faint he could not make it out
what
i said are you afraid of him
then you must get his permission tomorrow and set the engagement
make him understand that though you have nothing now you will give me a good home and be a son in law he can be proud of
there is no reason we should waste our years living apart when we feel like this
i can not do that he said with a note of despair willing her to understand
i can not provide for you i can not
do not youunderstand she stepped away her voice strained with urgency
i love you roran and i want to be with you but father has other plans for me
there are far more eligible men than you and the longer you delay the more he presses me to consent to a match of which he approves
he fears i will become an old maid and i fear that too
i have only so much time or choice in carvahall
if i must take another i ** tears glistened in her eyes as she gave him a searching glance waiting for his response then gathered up her dress and rushed back to the houses
roran stood there motionless with shock
her absence was as acute for him as losing the farm the world suddenly gone cold and unfriendly
it was as if part of himself had been torn away
it was hours before he could return to horst is and slip into bed
