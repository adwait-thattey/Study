afterward eragon rejoined saphira outside of the archer is tent and stood with her for a few minutes rubbing the muscles near the base of her neck
humming saphira flicked her sinuous tail and twisted her head and shoulders so that he had better access to her smooth plated underside
she said while you were occupied in there other petitioners came to seek an audience with you but blodhgarm and his ilk turned them away for their requests were not urgent
is that so he dug his fingers under the edge of one of her large neck scales scratching even harder
perhaps i should emulate nasuada
on the sixth day of every week from morning until noon she grants an audience to everyone who wishes to bring requests or disputes before her
i could do the same
i like the idea said saphira
only you will have to be careful that you do not expend too much of your energy on people is demands
we must be ready to fight the empire at a moment is notice
she pushed her neck against his hand humming even louder
i need a sword eragon said
eragon continued to scratch her until she pulled away and said you will be late for nasuada unless you hurry
together they started toward the center of the camp and nasuada is pavilion
it was less than a quarter of a mile away so saphira walked with him instead of soaring among the clouds as she had before
about a hundred feet from the pavilion they chanced upon angela the herbalist
she was kneeling between two tents pointing at a square of leather draped across a low flat rock
on the leather lay a jumbled pile of finger length bones branded with a different symbol on each facet the knucklebones of a dragon with which she had read eragon is future in teirm
opposite angela sat a tall woman with broad shoulders tanned weather beaten skin black hair braided in a long thick rope down her back and a face that was still handsome despite the hard lines that the years had carved around her mouth
she wore a russet dress that had been made for a shorter woman her wrists stuck out several inches from the ends of her sleeves
she had tied a strip of dark cloth around each wrist but the strip on the left had loosened and slipped toward her elbow
eragon saw thick layers of scars where it had been
they were the sort of scars one could only get from the constant chafing of manacles
at some point he realized she had been captured by her enemies and she had fought fought until she had torn open her wrists to the bone if her scars were anything to judge by
he wondered whether she had been a criminal or a slave and he felt his countenance darken as he considered the thought of someone being so cruel as to allow such harm to befall a prisoner under his control even if it was self inflicted
next to the woman was a serious looking teenage girl just entering into the full bloom of her adult beauty
the muscles of her forearms were unusually large as if she had been an apprentice to a smith or a swordsman which was highly improbable for a girl no matter how strong she might be
angela had just finished saying something to the woman and her companion when eragon and saphira halted behind the curlyhaired witch
with a single motion angela gathered up the knucklebones in the leather square and tucked them under the yellow sash at her waist
standing she flashed eragon and saphira a brilliant smile
my you both have the most impeccable sense of timing
you always seem to turn up whenever the drop spindle of fate begins to spin
the drop spindle of fate questioned eragon
she shrugged
what you can not expect brilliance all the time not even from ** she gestured at the two strangers who had also stood and said eragon will you consent to give them your blessing they have endured many dangers and a hard road yet lies before them
i am sure they would appreciate whatever protection the benediction of a dragon rider may convey
eragon hesitated
he knew that angela rarely cast the dragon bones for the people who sought her services usually only for those whom solembum deigned to speak with as such a prognostication was no false act of magic but rather a true foretelling that could reveal the mysteries of the future
