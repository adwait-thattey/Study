i am telling you i saw ** one of them shouted
he was of medium height with ruddy cheeks and a yellow beard
his heart hammering eragon struggled to keep his breathing slow and quiet
he touched his brow to ensure the cloth strip he had tied around his head still covered his upswept eyebrows and pointed ears
i wish i were still wearing my armor he thought
in order to avoid attracting unwanted attention he had made himself a pack using dead branches and a square of canvas he had bartered from a tinker and placed his armor within it
now he dared not remove and don his armor for fear the soldiers would hear
the soldier with the yellow beard climbed down from his bay charger and walked along the edge of the road studying the ground and the juniper trees beyond
like every member of galbatorix is army the soldier wore a red tunic embroidered with gold thread in the outline of a jagged tongue of fire
the thread sparkled as he moved
his armor was simple a helmet a tapered shield and a leather brigandine indicating he was little more than a mounted footman
as for arms he bore a spear in his right hand and a longsword on his left hip
as the soldier approached his location spurs clinking eragon began to whisper a complex spell in the ancient language
the words poured off his tongue in an unbroken stream until to his alarm he mispronounced a particularly difficult cluster of vowels and had to start the incantation anew
the soldier took another step toward him
just as the soldier paused in front of him eragon completed the spell and felt his strength ebb as the magic took effect
he was an instant too late however to completely escape detection for the soldier exclaimed ** and brushed aside the branches exposing eragon
the soldier peered directly at him and frowned
what the
he muttered
he jabbed his spear into the thicket missing eragon is face by less than an inch
eragon dug his nails into his palms as a tremor racked his clenched muscles
ah blast it said the soldier and released the branches which sprang back to their original positions hiding eragon once more
what was it called another of the men
nothing said the soldier returning to his companions
he removed his helmet and wiped his brow
my eyes are playing tricks on me
what does that bastard braethan expect of us we ve hardly gotten a wink of sleep these past two days
aye
the king must be desperate to drive us so hard
to be honest i d rather not find whoever it is we re searching for
it is not that i am faint hearted but anyone who gives galbatorix pause is best avoided by the likes of us
let murtagh and his monster of a dragon catch our mysterious fugitive eh
unless we be searching for murtagh suggested a third man
you heard what morzan is spawn said well as i did
an uncomfortable silence settled over the soldiers
then the one who was on the ground vaulted back onto his charger wrapped the reins around his left hand and said keep your yap shut derwood
you talk too much
with that the group of six spurred their steeds forward and continued north on the road
as the sound of the horses faded eragon ended the spell then rubbed his eyes with his fists and rested his hands on his knees
a long low laugh escaped him and he shook his head amused by how outlandish his predicament was compared with his upbringing in palancar valley
i certainly never imagined this happening to me he thought
the spell he had used contained two parts the first bent rays of light around his body so he appeared invisible and the second hopefully prevented other spellweavers from detecting his use of magic
the spell is main drawbacks were that it could not conceal footprints therefore one had to remain stone still while using it and it often failed to completely eliminate a person is shadow
picking his way out of the thicket eragon stretched his arms high over his head and then faced the ravine from whence the soldiers had emerged
a single question occupied him as he resumed his journey
the gauzelike illusion of eragon is waking dreams vanished as he tore at the air with his hands
