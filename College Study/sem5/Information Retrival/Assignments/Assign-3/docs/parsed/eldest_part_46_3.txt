he then would free himself by pulling on slipknots with his teeth
the trip ended at a cluster of four mountains that towered over the forest the first mountains eragon had seen in du weldenvarden
white capped and windswept they pierced the veil of clouds and bared their crevassed brows to the beating sun which was heatless at such altitude
they look so small compared to the beors said saphira
as had become his habit during weeks of meditation eragon extended his mind in every direction touching upon the consciousnesses around him in search of any who might mean him harm
he felt a marmot warm in her burrow ravens nuthatches and hawks numerous squirrels running among the trees and farther down the mountain rock snakes undulating through the brush in search of the mice that were their prey as well as the hordes of ubiquitous insects
when glaedr descended to a bare ridge on the first mountain saphira had to wait until he folded his massive wings before there was enough room for her to land
the field of boulder strewn talus they alighted upon was brilliant yellow from a coating of hard crenulated lichen
above them loomed a sheer black cliff
it acted as buttress and dam for a cornice of blue ice that groaned and split under the wind loosing jagged slabs that shattered on the granite below
this peak is known as fionula said ** her brothers are ethrundr merogoven and griminsmal
each has its own tale which i shall recount on the flight back
but for now i shall address the purpose of this trip namely the nature of the bond forged between dragons and elves and later humans
you both know something of it and i have hinted at its full implications to saphira but the time has come to learn the solemn and profound meaning of your partnership so that you may uphold it when oromis and i are no more
master asked eragon wrapping his cloak around himself to stay warm
why is oromis not here with us
because rumbled glaedr it is my duty as was always the duty of an elder dragon in centuries past to ensure that the newest generation of riders understands the true importance of the station they have assumed
and because oromis is not as well as he appears
the rocks cracked with muffled reports as glaedr coiled up nestling himself among the scree and placing his majestic head upon the ground lengthwise to eragon and saphira
he examined them with one gold eye as large as a polished roundshield and twice as brilliant
a gray smudge of smoke drifted from his nostrils and was blown to tatters by the ** of what i am about to reveal were common knowledge among the elves riders and learned humans but much of it was known only to the leader of the riders a mere handful of elves the humans current potentate and of course the dragons
listen now my hatchlings
when peace was made between dragons and elves at the end of our war the riders were created to ensure that such conflict would never again arise between our two races
queen tarmunora of the elves and the dragon who had been selected to represent us whose name he paused and conveyed a series of impressions to eragon long tooth white tooth chipped tooth fights won fights lost countless eaten shrrg and nagra seven and twenty eggs sired and nineteen offspring grown to maturity cannot be expressed in any language decided that a common treaty would not suffice
signed paper means nothing to a dragon
our blood runs hot and thick and given enough time it was inevitable that we would clash with the elves again as we had with the dwarves over the millennia
but unlike with the dwarves neither we nor the elves could afford another war
we were both too powerful and we would have destroyed each other
the one way to prevent that and to forge a meaningful accord was to link our two races with magic
eragon shivered and with a touch of amusement glaedr said saphira if you are wise you will heat one of these rocks with the fire from your belly so that your rider does not freeze
thereupon saphira arched her neck and a jet of blue flame emanated from between her serrated fangs and splashed against the scree blackening the lichen which released a bitter smell as it burned
