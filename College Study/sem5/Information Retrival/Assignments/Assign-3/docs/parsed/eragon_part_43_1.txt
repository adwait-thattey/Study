eragon stretched in the hall he was stiff from sitting so long
behind him the twins entered ajihad is study and closed the door
eragon looked at orik
i am sorry that you re in trouble because of me he apologized
do not bother yourself grunted orik tugging on his beard
ajihad gave me what i wanted
even saphira was startled by the statement
what do you mean said eragon
you can not train or fight and you re stuck guarding me
how can that be what you wanted
the dwarf eyed him quietly
ajihad is a good leader
he understands how to keep the law yet remain just
i have been punished by his command but i am also one of hrothgar is subjects
under his rule i am still free to do what i wish
eragon realized it would be unwise to forget orik is dual loyalty and the split nature of power within tronjheim
ajihad just placed you in a powerful position did not he
orik chuckled deeply
that he did and in such a way the twins can not complain about it
this will irritate them for sure
ajihad is a tricky one he is
come lad i am sure you re hungry
and we have to get your dragon settled in
saphira hissed
eragon said her name is saphira
orik made a small bow to her
my apologies i will be sure to remember ** he took an orange lamp from the wall and led them down the hallway
can others in farthen dur use magic asked eragon struggling to keep up with the dwarf is brisk pace
he cradled zar roc carefully concealing the symbol on the sheath with his arm
few enough said orik with a swift shrug under his mail
and the ones we have can not do much more than heal bruises
they ve all had to tend to arya because of the strength needed to heal her
oei grumbled orik
she would not want their help anyway their arts are not for healing
their talents lie in scheming and plotting for power to everyone else is detriment
deynor ajihad is predecessor allowed them to join the varden because he needed their support
you can not oppose the empire without spellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle
they re a nasty pair but they do have their uses
they entered one of the four main tunnels that divided tronjheim
clusters of dwarves and humans strolled through it voices echoing loudly off the polished floor
the conversations stopped abruptly as they saw saphira scores of eyes fixed on her
orik ignored the spectators and turned left heading toward one of tronjheim is distant gates
where are we going asked eragon
out of these halls so saphira can fly to the dragonhold above isidar mithrim the star rose
the dragonhold does not have a roof tronjheim is peak is open to the sky like that of farthen dur so she that is you saphira will be able to glide straight down into the hold
it is where the riders used to stay when they visited tronjheim
wo not it be cold and damp without a roof asked eragon
** orik shook his head
farthen dur protects us from the elements
neither rain nor snow intrude here
besides the hold is walls are lined with marble caves for dragons
they provide all the shelter necessary
all you need fear are the icicles when they fall they ve been known to cleave a horse in two
i will be fine assured ** marble cave is safer than any of the other places we ve stayed
perhaps
do you think murtagh will be all right
ajihad strikes me as an honorable man
unless murtagh tries to escape i doubt he will be harmed
eragon crossed his arms unwilling to talk further
he was dazed by the change in circumstances from the day before
their mad race from gil ead was finally over but his body expected to continue running and riding
where are our horses
in the stables by the gate
we can visit them before leaving tronjheim
they exited tronjheim through the same gate they had entered
the gold griffins gleamed with colored highlights garnered from scores of lanterns
the sun had moved during eragon is talk with ajihad light no longer entered farthen dur through the crater opening
without those moted rays the inside of the hollow mountain was velvety black
the only illumination came from tronjheim which sparkled brilliantly in the gloom
the city mountain is radiance was enough to brighten the ground hundreds of feet away
