for a moment the sword hovered between jormundur and nasuada teetering on the wire edge of two different destinies
eragon felt his breath catch such a simple choice to balance a life on
and more than a life a dragon a king an empire
then his breath rushed in filling his lungs with time once again and he swung to face nasuada
out of deep respect
and appreciation of the difficulties facing you
i eragon first rider of the varden shadeslayer and argetlam give you my blade and my fealty nasuada
the varden and dwarves stared dumbstruck
in that same instant the council of elders flashed from triumphant gloating to enraged impotence
their glares burned with the strength and venom of those betrayed
even elessari let outrage burst through her pleasant demeanor
only jormundur after a brief jolt of surprise seemed to accept the announcement with equanimity
nasuada smiled and grasped zar roc placing the sword is tip on eragon is forehead just as before
i am honored that you choose to serve me rider eragon
i accept as you accept all the responsibilities accompanying the station
rise as my vassal and take your sword
eragon did so then stepped back with saphira
with shouts of approval the crowd rose to their feet the dwarves stamping in rhythm with their hobnail boots while human warriors banged swords across shields
turning to the podium nasuada gripped it on either side and looked up at all the people in the amphitheater
she beamed at them pure joy shining from her face
people of the **
as my father did before me i give my life to you and our cause
i will never cease fighting until the urgals are vanquished galbatorix is dead and alagaesia is free once **
therefore i say to you now is the time to prepare
here in farthen dur after endless skirmishes we won our greatest battle
it is our turn to strike back
galbatorix is weak after losing so many forces and there will never again be such an opportunity
therefore i say again now is the time to prepare so that we may once more stand **
after more speeches by various personages including a still glowering falberd the amphitheater began to empty
as eragon stood to leave orik grasped his arm stopping him
the dwarf was wide eyed
eragon did you plan all that beforehand
eragon briefly considered the wisdom of telling him then nodded
yes
orik exhaled shaking his head
that was a bold stroke it was
you ve given nasuada a strong position to begin with
it was dangerous though if the reactions of the council of elders are anything to judge by
did arya approve of this
the dwarf studied him thoughtfully
i am sure it was
you just altered the balance of power eragon
no one will underestimate you again because of it
beware the rotten stone
you have earned some powerful enemies ** he slapped eragon on the side and continued past
saphira watched him go then said we should prepare to leave farthen dur
the council will be thirsty for revenge
the sooner we re out of their reach the better
