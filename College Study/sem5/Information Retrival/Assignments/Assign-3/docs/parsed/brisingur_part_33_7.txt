as orik had asked eragon remained impassive throughout the meeting concealing his reactions from those who were watching
when the clanmeet broke for their midday meal he hastened over to orik and bending so that no one else could hear said do not look for me at your table
i have had my fill of sitting and talking
i am going to explore the tunnels for a bit
orik nodded appearing distracted and murmured in reply do as you wish only be sure you are here when we resume it would not be meet for you to play truant no matter how tedious these talks be
eragon edged out of the conference room along with the press of dwarves eager to have their lunches and rejoined his four guards in the hallway outside where they had been playing dice with idle warriors from other clans
with his guards in tow eragon struck out in a random direction allowing his feet to carry him where they would while he pondered methods of welding the dwarves contentious factions into a whole united against galbatorix
to his exasperation the only methods he could envision were so far fetched it was absurd to imagine they might succeed
eragon paid little attention to the dwarves he met in the tunnels aside from mumbled greetings that courtesy occasionally demanded nor even to his exact surroundings trusting that kvistor could guide him back to the conference room
although eragon did not study his surroundings in any great detail visually he kept track of the minds of every living creature he was able to sense within a radius of several hundred feet even down to the smallest spider crouched behind its web in the corner of a room for eragon had no desire to be surprised by anyone who might have cause to seek him out
when at last he stopped he was surprised to find himself in the same dusty room he had discovered during his wanderings the previous day
there to his left were the same five black arches that led to caverns unknown while there to his right was the same bas relief carving of the head and shoulders of a snarling bear
bemused by the coincidence eragon sauntered over to the bronze sculpture and gazed up at the bear is gleaming fangs wondering what had drawn him back
after a moment he went to the middle of the five archways and gazed through it
the narrow hallway beyond was devoid of lanterns and soon faded into the soft oblivion of shadow
reaching out with his consciousness eragon probed the length of the tunnel and several of the abandoned chambers it opened to
a half dozen spiders and a sparse collection of moths millipedes and blind crickets were the only inhabitants
** called eragon and listened as the hall returned his voice to him with ever decreasing volume
kvistor said eragon looking at him does no one at all live in these ancient parts
the fresh faced dwarf answered some do
a few strange knurlan those to whom empty solitude is more pleasing than the touch of their wife is hand or the sound of their friends voices
it was one such knurlag who warned us of the approach of the urgal army if you remember argetlam
also although we do not speak of it often there are those who have broken the laws of our land and whom their clan chiefs have banished on pain of death for a term of years or if the offense is severe for the remainder of their lives
all such are as the walking dead to us we shun them if we meet them outside of our lands and hang them if we catch them within our borders
when kvistor had finished speaking eragon indicated that he was ready to leave
kvistor took the lead and eragon followed him out the doorway through which they had entered the three other dwarves close behind
they had gone no more than twenty feet when eragon heard a faint scuffing from the rear so faint kvistor did not seem to notice
eragon glanced back
by the amber light cast by the flameless lanterns mounted on either side of the passageway he saw seven dwarves garbed entirely in black their faces masked with dark cloth and their feet muffled with rags running toward his group with a speed that eragon had assumed was the sole province of elves shades and other creatures whose blood hummed with magic
