will you give me brom is ring eragon without hesitation he pulled it off his finger and offered it to the queen who plucked it from his palm with her slim fingers
you should not have worn this eragon as it was not meant for you
however because of the aid you have rendered the varden and my family i now name you elf friend and bestow this ring aren upon you so that all elves wherever you go will know that you are to be trusted and helped
eragon thanked her and returned the ring to his finger acutely aware of the queen is gaze which remained upon him with disturbing perception studying and analyzing
he felt as if she knew everything that he might say or do
she said such tidings as yours we have not heard the like of in du weldenvarden for many a year
we are accustomed to a slower way of life here than the rest of alagaesia and it troubles me that so much could occur so swiftly without word of it reaching my ear
and what of my training eragon snatched a furtive glance at the seated elves wondering if any of them could be togira ikonoka the being who had reached into his mind and freed him of durza is foul influence after the battle in farthen dur and who had also encouraged eragon to travel to ellesmera
it will begin in the fullness of time
yet i fear that instructing you is futile so long as your infirmity persists
unless you can overcome the shade is magic you will be reduced to no more than a figurehead
you may still be useful but only as a shadow of the hope that we have nurtured for over a ** islanzadi spoke without reproach yet her words struck eragon like hammer blows
he knew that she was right
your situation is not your fault and it pains me to voice such things but you must understand the gravity of your disability
i am sorry
then islanzadi addressed orik it has been long since one of your race entered our halls dwarf
eragon finiarel has explained your presence but do you have aught to add
only royal greetings from my king hrothgar and a plea now unneeded for you to resume contact with the varden
beyond that i am here to see that the pact that brom forged between you and the humans is honored
we keep our promises whether we utter them in this language or in the ancient language
i accept hrothgar is greetings and return them in ** finally as eragon was sure she had longed to do since they first arrived islanzadi looked at arya and asked now daughter what befell you
arya began to speak in a slow monotone first of her capture and then of her long imprisonment and torture in gil ead
saphira and eragon had deliberately avoided the details of her abuse but arya herself seemed to have no difficulty recounting what she had been subjected to
her emotionless descriptions roused the same rage within eragon as when he first saw her wounds
the elves remained completely silent throughout arya is tale although they gripped their swords and their faces hardened into razor lines of cold anger
a single tear rolled down islanzadi is cheek
afterward a lithe elf lord paced along the mossy sward between the chairs
i know that i speak for us all arya drottningu when i say that my heart burns with sorrow for your ordeal
it is a crime beyond apology mitigation or reparation and galbatorix must be punished for it
also we are in your debt for keeping the locations of our cities hidden from the shade
few of us could have withstood him for so long
now islanzadi spoke and her voice rang like a bell among the trees
enough
our guests wait tired on their feet and we have spoken of evil things for far too long
i will not have this occasion marred by lingering on past ** a glorious smile brightened her expression
my daughter has returned a dragon and her rider have appeared and i will see us celebrate in the proper ** she stood tall and magnificent in her crimson tunic and clapped her hands
at the sound the chairs and pavilion were showered with hundreds of lilies and roses that appeared twenty feet above their heads and drifted down like colorful snowflakes suffusing the air with their heady fragrance
