once recovered he straightened and examined his surroundings
he stood in a circular vestibule with a pedestal in the center out of which spiraled a sculpture of two pale hands and forearms that twined around each other without touching
three screen doors led from the vestibule one to an austere dining room that might hold ten people at the most one to a closet with an empty hollow in the floor that eragon could think of no discernible use for and the last to a bedroom overlooking and open to the wide expanse of du weldenvarden
taking a lantern from its hook in the ceiling eragon entered the bedroom creating a host of shadows that jumped and swirled like madcap dancers
a teardrop gap large enough for a dragon pierced the outer wall
inside the room was a bed situated so that he could watch the sky and the moon while lying on his back a fireplace made of gray wood that felt as hard and cold as steel when he touched it as if the timber had been compressed to unsurpassed density and a huge low rimmed bowl set in the floor and lined with soft blankets where saphira could sleep
even as he watched she swooped down and landed on the edge of the opening her scales twinkling like a constellation of blue stars
behind her the last rays of the sun streaked across the forest painting the various ridges and hills with a hazy amber that made the needles glow like hot iron and chased the shadows back toward the violet horizon
from their height the city appeared as a series of gaps in the voluminous canopy islands of calm in a restless ocean
ellesmera is true scope was now revealed it extended for several miles to the west and to the north
i respect the riders even more if this is how vrael normally lived said ** is much simpler than i expected
the entire structure rocked slightly in response to a breath of wind
saphira sniffed her ** have yet to see vroengard she cautioned although he sensed that she agreed with him
as eragon closed the screen to the bedroom he saw something in the corner that he had missed during his first inspection a spiral staircase that wound up a dark wood chimney
thrusting the lantern before him he cautiously ascended one step at a time
after about twenty feet he emerged in a study furnished with a writing desk stocked with quills ink and paper but no parchment and another padded roost for a dragon to curl up on
the far wall also had an opening to fly through
through the ** winced as layers of bark splintered and cracked under saphira is claws while she crawled out of the bedroom and up the side of the compound to the ** he asked when she arrived
saphira raked him with her sapphire eyes then proceeded to scrutinize the walls and furniture
i wonder she said how you are supposed to stay warm when the rooms are open to the elements
i do not ** examined the walls on either side of the breach running his hands over abstract patterns that had been coaxed from the tree by the elves songs
he stopped when he felt a vertical ridge embedded in the bark
he tugged on it and a diaphanous membrane unspooled from within the wall
pulling it across the portal he found a second groove to hold the hem of the cloth
as soon as it was fastened the air thickened and became noticeably ** is your answer he said
he released the cloth and it lashed back and forth as it rewound itself
when they returned to the bedroom eragon unpacked while saphira coiled upon her dais
he carefully arranged his shield bracers greaves coif and helm then stripped off his tunic and removed his shirt of leather backed mail
he sat bare chested on the bed and studied the oiled links struck by their similarity to saphira is scales
a long journey
but yes we made it
we re lucky that misfortune did not strike upon the road
he ** we will find out if it was worth it
sometimes i wonder if our time would have been better spent helping the varden
** you know that we need further instruction
brom would have wanted it
besides ellesmera and islanzadi were certainly worth coming all this way to see
** he asked what do you make of all this
