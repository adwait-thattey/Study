continuing on through the burning plains saphira said hrothgar was a great king
aye and a good ** ** should find arya and nasuada
i could not even heal a scratch right now and they need to know about murtagh
they angled south toward the varden is encampment but before they traveled more than a few yards eragon saw roran approaching from the jiet river
trepidation filled him
roran stopped directly in front of them planted his feet wide apart and stared at eragon working his jaw up and down as if he wanted to talk but was unable to get the words past his teeth
then he punched eragon on the chin
it would have been easy for eragon to avoid the blow but he allowed it to land rolling away from it a bit so roran did not break his knuckles
wincing eragon faced his cousin
i guess i deserved that
that you did
we have to talk
it can not wait
the ra zac captured katrina and i need your help to rescue her
they ve had her ever since we left carvahall
so that is ** an instant eragon realized why roran appeared so grim and haunted and why he had brought the entire village to ** was right galbatorix sent the ra zac back to palancar valley
eragon frowned torn between his responsibility to roran and his duty to report to nasuada
there is something i need to do first and then we can talk
all right you can accompany me if you want
as they traversed the pockmarked land eragon kept glancing at roran out of the corner of his eye
finally he said in a low voice i missed you
roran faltered then responded with a curt nod
a few steps later he asked this is saphira right jeod said that was her name
saphira peered at roran with one of her glittering eyes
he bore her scrutiny without turning away which was more than most people could ** have always wanted to meet eragon is nest mate
she ** exclaimed roran when eragon repeated her words
this time saphira addressed him directly what did you think i was as mute as a rock lizard
roran blinked
i beg your pardon
i did not know that dragons were so ** a grim smile twisted his lips
first ra zac and magicians now dwarves riders and talking dragons
it seems the whole world has gone mad
i saw you fight that other rider
did you wound him is that why he fled
when they reached the pavilion eragon was searching for he swept back the flap and ducked inside followed by roran and saphira who pushed her head and neck in after them
in the center of the tent nasuada sat on the edge of the table letting a maid remove her twisted armor while she carried on a heated discussion with arya
the cut on her thigh had been healed
nasuada stopped in the middle of her sentence as she spotted the new arrivals
running toward them she threw her arms around eragon and cried where were you we thought you were dead or worse
the candle still burns murmured arya
stepping back nasuada said we could not see what happened to you and saphira after you landed on the plateau
when the red dragon left and you did not appear arya tried to contact you but felt nothing so we assumed
she trailed off
we were just debating the best way to transport du vrangr gata and an entire company of warriors across the river
i am sorry
i did not mean to worry you
i was just so tired after the fight i forgot to lower my ** then eragon brought roran forward
nasuada i would like to introduce my cousin roran
ajihad may have mentioned him to you before
roran lady nasuada leader of the varden and my liegelord
and this is arya svit kona the elves ** roran bowed to each of them in turn
it is an honor to meet eragon is cousin said nasuada
after they finished exchanging greetings eragon explained that the entire village of carvahall had arrived on thedragon wing and that roran was the one responsible for killing the twins
nasuada lifted a dark eyebrow
the varden are in your debt roran for stopping their rampage
who knows how much damage the twins would have caused before eragon or arya could have confronted them you helped us to win this battle
i wo not forget that
our supplies are limited but i will see that everyone on your ship is clothed and fed and that your sick are treated
