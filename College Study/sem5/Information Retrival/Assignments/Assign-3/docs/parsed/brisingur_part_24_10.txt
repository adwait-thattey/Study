we do not know how
du vrangr gata has heard nothing but gibberish from orrin is ** regaining her breath arya started examining saphira is cuts and bruises
before eragon could ask more a collection of excited cries from within the maelstrom of warriors drowned out the rest of the tumult and he heard king orrin shout back back all of ** archers hold the ** blast you no one move we have **
saphira had the same thought as eragon
gathering her legs under her she leaped over the ring of horsemen startling the horses so they bucked and ran and made her way across the corpsestrewn battlefield toward the sound of king orrin is voice brushing aside men and urgals alike as if they were so many stalks of grass
the rest of the elves hurried to keep up swords and bows in hand
saphira found orrin sitting on his charger at the leading edge of the tightly packed warriors staring at a lone man forty feet away
the king was flushed and wild eyed his armor besmirched with filth from combat
he had been wounded under his left arm and the shaft of a spear protruded several inches from his right thigh
when saphira is approach caught his attention his face registered sudden relief
good good you re here he muttered as saphira crawled abreast of his charger
we needed you saphira and you shade ** one of the archers edged forward a few inches
orrin waved his sword at him and yelled ** i will have the head of anyone who does not remain where he is i swear by angvard is ** then orrin resumed glaring at the lone man
eragon followed his gaze
the man was a soldier of medium height with a purple birthmark on his neck and brown hair plastered flat by the helmet he had been wearing
his shield was a splintered ruin
his sword was notched bent and broken missing the last six inches
river mud caked his mail hose
blood sheeted from a gash along his ribs
an arrow fletched with white swan feathers had impaled his right foot and pinned it to the ground three quarters of the shaft buried in the hard dirt
from the man is throat a horrid gurgling laugh emanated
it rose and fell with a drunken cadence pitching from note to note as if the man were about to begin shrieking with horror
what are you shouted king orrin
when the soldier did not immediately respond the king cursed and said answer me or i will let my spellcasters at you
be you man or beast or some ill spawned demon in what foul pit did galbatorix find you and your brothers are you kin of the ra zac
the king is last question acted like a needle driven into eragon he straightened bolt upright every sense tingling
the laughter paused for a moment
man
i am a man
you are like no man i know
i wanted to assure the future of my family
is that so foreign to you surdan
give me no riddles you fork tongued ** tell me how you became as you are and speak honestly lest you convince me to pour boiling lead down your throat and see if that pains you
the unbalanced chuckles intensified then the soldier said you cannot hurt me surdan
no one can
the king himself made us impervious to pain
in return our families will live in comfort for the rest of their lives
you can hide from us but we will never stop pursuing you even when ordinary men would drop dead from exhaustion
you can fight us but we will continue killing you as long as we have an arm to swing
you cannot even surrender to us for we take no prisoners
you can do nothing but die and return this land to peace
with a gruesome grimace the soldier wrapped his mangled shield hand around the arrow and with the sound of tearing flesh pulled the shaft out of his foot
lumps of crimson meat clung to the arrowhead as it came free
the soldier shook the arrow at them then threw the missile at one of the archers wounding him in the hand
his laugh louder than ever the soldier lurched forward dragging his injured foot behind him
he raised his sword as if he intended to attack
bowstrings twanged like badly tuned lutes then a score of spinning arrows leaped toward the soldier and an instant later struck him in the torso
two of the arrows bounced off his gambeson the remainder penetrated his rib cage
