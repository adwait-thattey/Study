it had taken him but an instant to locate the rabbits with his mind and then kill them with one of the twelve death words
what he had learned from oromis had drained the challenge and excitement from the ** did not even have to stalk them he thought remembering the years he had spent honing his tracking abilities
he grimaced with sour ** can finally bag any game i want and it seems meaningless to me
at least when i hunted with a pebble with brom it was still a challenge but this
this is slaughter
the warning of the sword shaper rhunon returned to him then when you can have anything you want by uttering a few words the goal matters not only the journey to it
i should have paid more attention to her realized eragon
with practiced movements he drew his old hunting knife skinned and gutted the rabbits and then putting aside the hearts lungs kidneys and livers buried the viscera so that the scent would not attract scavengers
next he dug a pit filled it with wood and lit a small blaze with magic since he had not thought to bring his flint and steel
he tended the fire until he had a bed of coals
cutting a wand of dogwood he stripped the bark and seared the wood over the coals to burn off the bitter sap then spitted the carcasses on the wand and suspended them between two forked branches pounded into the ground
for the organs he placed a flat stone upon a section of the coals and greased it with fat for a makeshift frying pan
saphira found him crouched by the fire slowly turning the wand to cook the meat evenly
she landed with a limp deer hanging from her jaws and the remains of a second deer clutched in her talons
measuring her length out in the fragrant grass she proceeded to gorge upon her prey eating the entire deer including the hide
bones cracked between her razor teeth like branches snapping in a gale
when the rabbits were ready eragon waved them in the air to cool them then stared at the glistening golden meat the smell of which he found almost unbearably enticing
as he opened his mouth to take the first bite his thoughts turned unbidden to his meditations
he remembered his excursions into the minds of birds and squirrels and mice how full of energy they felt and how vigorously they fought for the right to exist in the face of ** if this life is all they have
gripped by revulsion eragon thrust the meat away as appalled by the fact that he had killed the rabbits as if he had murdered two people
his stomach churned and threatened to make him purge himself
saphira paused in her feast to eye him with concern
taking a long breath eragon pressed his fists against his knees in an attempt to master himself and understand why he was so strongly affected
his entire life he had eaten meat fish and fowl
heenjoyed it
and yet it now made him physically ill to consider dining upon the rabbits
he looked at ** can not do it he said
it is the way of the world that everything eats everything else
why do you resist the order of things
he pondered her question
he did not condemn those who did partake of flesh he knew that it was the only means of survival for many a poor farmer
but he could no longer do so himself unless faced with starvation
having been inside of a rabbit and having felt what a rabbit feels
eating one would be akin to eating ** we can better ourselves he answered ** we give in to our impulses to hurt or kill any who anger us to take whatever we want from those who are weaker and in general to disregard the feelings of others we are made imperfect and must guard against our flaws lest they destroy ** gestured at the ** oromis said why should we cause unnecessary suffering
would you deny all of your desires then
i would deny those that are destructive
in that case said saphira advancing upon him these will make a fine dessert
in a blink she gulped down the rabbits and then licked clean the stone with the organs abrading the slate with the barbs on her ** at least cannot live on plants alone that is food for prey not a dragon
i refuse to be ashamed about how i must sustain myself
