as they walked the boy admired zar roc with bright eyes then looked down shyly
what are you called asked eragon
that is a good name
you carried your message well you should be ** jarsha beamed and bounced forward
they reached a convex stone door which jarsha pushed open
the room inside was circular with a sky blue dome decorated with constellations
a round marble table inlaid with the crest of durgrimst ingeitum an upright hammer ringed by twelve stars stood in the center of the chamber
seated there were jormundur and two other men one tall and one broad a woman with pinched lips close set eyes and elaborately painted cheeks and a second woman with an immense pile of gray hair above a matronly face belied by a dagger hilt peeking out of the vast hills of her bodice
you may go said jormundur to jarsha who quickly bowed and left
conscious that he was being watched eragon surveyed the room then seated himself in the middle of a swath of empty chairs so that the council members were forced to turn in their seats in order to look at him
saphira hunkered directly behind him he could feel her hot breath on the top of his head
jormundur got halfway up to make a slight bow then reseated himself
thank you for coming eragon even though you have suffered your own loss
this is umerth the tall man falberd the broad one and sabrae and elessari the two women
eragon inclined his head then asked and what of the twins were they part of this council
sabrae shook her head sharply and tapped a long fingernail on the table
they had naught to do with us
they were slime worse than slime leeches that worked only for their own benefit
they had no desire to serve the varden
thus they had no place in this ** eragon could smell her perfume all the way on the other side of the table it was thick and oily like a rotting flower
he hid a smile at the thought
enough
we re not here to discuss the twins said jormundur
we face a crisis that must be dealt with quickly and effectively
if we do not choose ajihad is successor someone else will
hrothgar has already contacted us to convey his condolences
while he was more than courteous he is sure to be forming his own plans even as we speak
we must also consider du vrangr gata the magic users
most of them are loyal to the varden but it is difficult to predict their actions even in the best of times
they might decide to oppose our authority for their own advantage
that is why we need your assistance eragon to provide the legitimacy required by whoever is to take ajihad is place
falberd heaved himself up planting his meaty hands on the table
the five of us have already decided whom to support
there is no doubt among us that it is the right person
but he raised a thick finger before we reveal who it is you must give us your word of honor that whether you agree or disagree with us nothing of our discussion will leave this room
why would they want that eragon asked saphira
i do not know she said ** might be a trap
it is a gamble you will have to take
remember though they have not asked meto pledge anything
i can always tell arya what they say if needed
silly of them forgetting that i am as intelligent as any human
pleased with the thought eragon said very well you have my word
now who do you want to lead the varden
surprised eragon dropped his gaze thinking quickly
he had not considered nasuada for the succession because of her youth she was just a few years older than eragon
no real reason existed of course for her not to lead but why would the council of elders want her to how would they benefit he remembered brom is advice and tried to examine the issue from every angle knowing that he had to decide swiftly
nasuada has steel in her observed ** would be like her father
maybe but what is their reason for picking her
to gain time eragon asked why not you jormundur ajihad called you his right hand man
does not that mean you should take his place now that he is gone
a current of unease ran through the council sabrae sat even straighter hands clasped before her umerth and falberd glanced at each other darkly while elessari just smiled the dagger hilt jiggling on her chest
