but unlike tea leaves crystal balls or even divining cards these have true power
they do not lie though understanding what they say is
complicated
if you wish i will cast and read them for you
but understand that to know one is fate can be a terrible thing
you must be sure of your decision
eragon looked at the bones with a feeling of ** lies what was once one of saphira is kin
to know one is fate
how can i make this decision when i do not know what lies in wait for me and whether i will like it ignorance is indeed bliss
why do you offer this he asked
because of solembum
he may have been rude but the fact that he spoke to you makes you special
heis a werecat after all
i offered to do this for the other two people who talked with him
only the woman agreed to it
selena was her name
ah she regretted it too
her fortune was bleak and painful
i do not think she believed it not at first
emotion overcame eragon bringing tears to his eyes
selena he whispered to himself
his mother is ** it have been her was her destiny so horrible that she had to abandon me do you remember anything about her fortune he asked feeling sick
angela shook her head and sighed
it was so long ago that the details have melted into the rest of my memory which is not as good as it used to be
besides i will not tell you what i do remember
that was for her and her alone
it was sad though i ve never forgotten the look on her face
eragon closed his eyes and struggled to regain control of his emotions
why do you complain about your memory he asked to distract himself
you re not that old
dimples appeared on angela is cheeks
i am flattered but do not be deceived i am much older than i look
the appearance of youth probably comes from having to eat my own herbs when times are lean
smiling eragon took a deep ** that was my mother and she could bear to have her fortune told i can too
cast the bones for me he said solemnly
angela is face became grave as she grasped the bones in each hand
her eyes closed and her lips moved in a soundless murmur
then she said powerfully ** ** ** and tossed the bones onto the cloth
they fell all jumbled together gleaming in the faint light
the words rang in eragon is ears he recognized them from the ancient language and realized with apprehension that to use them for magic angela must be a witch
she had not lied this was a true fortunetelling
minutes slowly passed as she studied the bones
finally angela leaned back and heaved a long sigh
she wiped her brow and pulled out a wineskin from under the counter
do you want some she asked
eragon shook his head
she shrugged and drank deeply
this she said wiping her mouth is the hardest reading i ve ever done
you were right
your future is nigh impossible to see
i ve never known of anyone is fate being so tangled and clouded
i was however able to wrestle a few answers from it
solembum jumped onto the counter and settled there watching them both
eragon clenched his hands as angela pointed to one of the bones
i will start here she said slowly because it is the clearest to understand
the symbol on the bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it
infinity or long life said angela quietly
this is the first time i have ever seen it come up in someone is future
most of the time it is the aspen or the elm both signs that a person will live a normal span of years
whether this means that you will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life i am not sure
whatever it foretells you may be sure that many years lie ahead of you
no surprises there i am a rider thought eragon
was angela only going to tell him things he already knew
now the bones grow harder to read as the rest are in a confused ** angela touched three of them
here the wandering path lightning bolt and sailing ship all lie together a pattern i ve never seen only heard of
the wandering path shows that there are many choices in your future some of which you face even now
i see great battles raging around you some of them fought for your sake
i see the mighty powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny
