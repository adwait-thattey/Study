eragon liked orik but to subordinate himself to the dwarf is authority when so much was at stake would be to relinquish even more of his freedom a prospect he loathed
and along with his freedom he would also be relinquishing part of his responsibility for the fate of alagaesia
eragon felt as if he were hanging off the edge of a precipice and orik was trying to convince him there was a ledge only a few feet below him but eragon could not bring himself to release his grip for fear he would fall to his doom
he said i would not be a mindless servant for you to order about
when it came to matters of durgrimst ingeitum i would defer to you but in all else you would have no hold over me
orik nodded his face serious
i am not worried about what mission nasuada might send you on nor whom you might kill while fighting the empire
no what gives me restless nights when i ought to be sleeping sound as arghen in his cave is imagining you attempting to influence the clanmeet is voting
your intentions are noble i know but noble or not you are unfamiliar with our politics no matter how well nasuada may have schooled you
this is mine area of expertise eragon
let me conduct it in the manner i deem appropriate
it is what hrothgar groomed me for my entire life
eragon sighed and with a sensation of falling he said very well
i will do as you think best about the succession grimstborith orik
a broad smile spread across orik is face
he tightened his grip on eragon is forearms then released him saying ah thank you eragon
you do not know what this means to me
it is good of you very good of you and i wo not forget it not if i live to be two hundred years old and my beard grows so long it drags in the dirt
despite himself eragon chuckled
well i hope it does not grow that long
you would trip over it all the **
perhaps i would at that said orik laughing
besides i rather think hvedra would cut it short once it reached my knees
she has very definite opinions about the proper length of a beard
it was with regret that eragon left behind the pale sunshine and fresh mountain air for the darkness of the tunnel
the passageway was eight feet wide and six feet high which made it feel quite low to eragon and like all the dwarf tunnels he had visited it was as straight as an arrow for as far as he could see
he looked back over his shoulder just in time to see the dwarf farr swing closed the hinged slab of granite that served as a door to the tunnel plunging their party into night
a moment later fourteen glowing orbs of differing colors appeared as the dwarves removed flameless lanterns from their saddlebags
orik handed one to eragon
then they started forward under the roots of the mountain and the ponies hooves filled the tunnel with clashing echoes that seemed to shout at them like angry wraiths
eragon grimaced knowing they would have to listen to the din all the way to farthen dur for that was where the tunnel ended many leagues thence
he hunched his shoulders and tightened his grip on the straps of his pack and wished he were with saphira flying high above the ground
