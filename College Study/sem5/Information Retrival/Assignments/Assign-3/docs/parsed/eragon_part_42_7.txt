still you are right
your position gives you the privilege to say such things
you cannot escape the politics of your situation youwill be influenced one way or another
i do not want to see you become a pawn of any one group or purpose any more than you do
you must retain your freedom for in it lies your true power the ability to make choices independent of any leader or king
my own authority over you will be limited but i believe it is for the best
the difficulty lies in making sure that those with power include you in their deliberations
also despite your protests the people here have certain expectations of you
they are going to bring you their problems no matter how petty and demand that you solve ** ajihad leaned forward his voice deadly serious
there will be cases where someone is future will rest in your hands
with a word you can send them careening into happiness or misery
young women will seek your opinion on whom they should marry many will pursue you as a husband and old men will ask which of their children should receive an inheritance
youmust be kind and wise with them all for they put their trust in you
do not speak flippantly or without thought because your words will have impact far beyond what you intend
ajihad leaned back his eyes hooded
the burden of leadership is being responsible for the well being of the people in your charge
i have dealt with it from the day i was chosen to head the varden and now you must as well
be careful
i wo not tolerate injustice under my command
do not worry about your youth and inexperience they will pass soon enough
eragon was uncomfortable with the idea of people asking him for advice
but you still have not said what i am to do here
for now nothing
you covered over a hundred and thirty leagues in eight days a feat to be proud of
i am sure that you will appreciate rest
when you ve recovered we will test your competency in arms and magic
after that well i will explain your options and then you will have to decide your course
and what about murtagh asked eragon bitingly
ajihad is face darkened
he reached beneath his desk and lifted up zar roc
the sword is polished sheath gleamed in the light
ajihad slid his hand over it lingering on the etched sigil
he will stay here until he allows the twins into his mind
you can not imprison him argued eragon
he is committed no **
we can not give him his freedom without being sure that he wo not turn against us
innocent or not he is potentially as dangerous to us as his father was said ajihad with a hint of sadness
eragon realized that ajihad would not be convinced otherwise and his concernwas valid
how were you able to recognize his voice
i met his father once said ajihad shortly
he tapped zar roc is hilt
i wish brom had told me he had taken morzan is sword
i suggest that you do not carry it within farthen dur
many here remember morzan is time with hate especially the dwarves
ajihad handed zar roc to him
that reminds me i have brom is ring which he sent as confirmation of his identity
i was keeping it for when he returned to tronjheim
now that he is dead i suppose it belongs to you and i think he would have wanted you to have ** he opened a desk drawer and took the ring from it
eragon accepted it with reverence
the symbol cut into the face of the sapphire was identical to the tattoo on arya is shoulder
he fit the ring onto his index finger admiring how it caught the light
i
i am honored he said
ajihad nodded gravely then pushed back his chair and stood
he faced saphira and spoke to her his voice swelling in power
do not think that i have forgotten you o mighty dragon
i have said these things as much for your benefit as for eragon is
it is even more important that you know them for to you falls the task of guarding him in these dangerous times
do not underestimate your might nor falter at his side because without you he will surely fail
saphira lowered her head until their eyes were level and stared at him through slitted black pupils
they examined each other silently neither of them blinking
ajihad was the first to move
