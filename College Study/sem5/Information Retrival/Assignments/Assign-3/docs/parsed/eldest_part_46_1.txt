the days eragon spent in ellesmera blended together without distinction time seemed to have no hold in the pinewood city
the season aged not even as the afternoons and evenings lengthened barring the forest with rich shadows
flowers of all months bloomed at the urging of the elves magic nourished by the enchantments spun through the air
eragon came to love ellesmera with its beauty and its quiet the graceful buildings that flowed out of the trees the haunting songs that echoed at twilight the works of art hidden within the mysterious dwellings and the introspection of the elves themselves which they mixed with outbursts of merriment
the wild animals of du weldenvarden had no fear of hunters
often eragon would look from his eyrie to see an elf petting a stag or a gray fox or murmuring to a shy bear that trundled along the edge of a clearing reluctant to expose himself
some animals had no recognizable form
they appeared at night moving and grunting in the bushes and fleeing if eragon dared approach
once he glimpsed a creature like a furred snake and once a white robed woman whose body wavered and disappeared to reveal a grinning she wolf in her place
eragon and saphira continued to explore ellesmera when they had the chance
they went alone or with orik for arya no longer accompanied them nor had eragon spoken to her since she broke his fairth
he saw her now and then flitting between the trees but whenever he approached intending to apologize she withdrew leaving him alone among the ancient pines
at last eragon realized that he had to take the initiative if he were to ever have a chance of mending his relationship with her
so one evening he picked a bouquet from the flowers along the path by his tree and hobbled to tialdari hall where he asked directions to arya is quarters from an elf in the common room
the screen door was open when he reached her chambers
no one answered when he knocked
he stepped inside listening for approaching footsteps as he glanced around the spacious vine covered living room which opened to a small bedroom on one side and a study on the other
two fairths decorated the walls a portrait of a stern proud elf with silver hair who eragon guessed was king evandar and that of a younger male elf whom he did not recognize
eragon wandered through the apartment looking but not touching savoring his glimpse into arya is life gleaning what he could about her interests and hobbies
by her bed he saw a glass sphere with a preserved blossom of the black morning glory embedded within it on her desk neat rows of scrolls with titles likeosilon harvest report andactivity noted by gil ead watchtower on the sill of an open bay window three miniature trees grown in the shape of glyphs from the ancient language the glyphs forpeace strength andwisdom and by the trees a scrap of paper with an unfinished poem covered with crossed out words and scribbled marks
it read
under the moon the bright white moon
lies a pool a flat silver pool
falls a stone a living stone
cracks the moon the bright white moon
shards of light swords of light
the quiet mere the still tarn
in the night the dark and heavy night
going to the small table by the entrance eragon laid his bouquet upon it and turned to leave
he froze as he saw arya standing in the doorway
she looked startled by his presence then concealed her emotions behind an impassive expression
they stared at each other in silence
he lifted the bouquet half offering it to her
i do not know how to make a blossom for you like faolin did but these are honest flowers and the best i could find
they re not
they re not that sort of ** he paused
it is no excuse but i did not realize beforehand that my fairth would put you in such a difficult situation
for that i am sorry and i cry your pardon
i was just trying to make a fairth not cause trouble
i understand the importance of my studies arya and you need not fear i will neglect them in order to moon after ** he swayed and leaned against the wall too dizzy to remain on his feet without support
that is all
