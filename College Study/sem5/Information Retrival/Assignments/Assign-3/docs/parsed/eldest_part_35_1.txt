after eragon and saphira had said their farewells they flew back to their tree house with saphira is new saddle dangling between her front claws
without acknowledging the fact they gradually opened their minds and allowed their connection to widen and deepen though neither of them consciously reached for the other
eragon is tumultuous emotions must have been strong enough for saphira to sense anyway though for she asked what happened then
a throbbing pain built up behind his eyes as he explained the terrible crime he had committed in farthen dur
saphira was as appalled by it as he was
he said your gift may help that girl but what i did is inexcusable and will only hurt her
the blame is not all yours
i share your knowledge of the ancient language and i did not spot the error any more than you ** eragon remained silent she added at least your back did not cause any trouble today
be grateful for that
he grunted unwilling to be tempted out of his black ** what did you learn this fine day
how to identify and avoid dangerous weather ** paused apparently ready to share the memories with him but he was too busy worrying about his distorted blessing to inquire further
nor could he bear the thought of being so intimate right then
when he did not pursue the matter saphira withdrew into a taciturn silence
back in their bedroom he found a tray of food by the screen door as he had the previous night
carrying the tray to his bed which had been remade with fresh linens he settled down to eat cursing the lack of meat
already sore from the rimgar he propped himself up with pillows and was about to take his first bite when there came a gentle rapping at the opening to his chamber
enter he growled
he took a drink of water
eragon nearly choked as arya stepped through the doorway
she had abandoned the leather clothes she usually wore in favor of a soft green tunic cinched at the waist with a girdle adorned with moonstones
she had also removed her customary headband allowing her hair to tumble around her face and over her shoulders
the biggest change however was not so much in her dress but her bearing the brittle tension that had permeated her demeanor ever since eragon first met her was now gone
she seemed to have finally relaxed
he scrambled to his feet noticing that her own were bare
** why are you here
touching her first two fingers to her lips she said do you plan on spending another evening inside
you have been in ellesmera for three days now and yet you have seen nothing of our city
i know that you always wished to explore it
set aside your weariness this once and accompany ** gliding toward him she took zar roc from where it lay by his side and beckoned to him
he rose from the bed and followed her into the vestibule where they descended through the trapdoor and down the precipitous staircase that wound around the rough tree trunk
overhead the gathering clouds glowed with the sun is last rays before it was extinguished behind the edge of the world
a piece of bark fell on eragon is head and he looked up to see saphira leaning out of their bedroom gripping the wood with her claws
without opening her wings she sprang into the air and dropped the hundred or so feet to the ground landing in a thunderous cloud of ** am coming
of course said arya as if she expected nothing less
eragon scowled he had wanted to be alone with her but he knew better than to complain
they walked under the trees where dusk already extended its tendrils from inside hollow logs dark crevices in boulders and the underside of knobby eaves
here and there a gemlike lantern twinkled within the side of a tree or at the end of a branch casting gentle pools of light on either side of the path
elves worked on various projects in and around the lanterns radius solitary except for a few rare couples
several elves sat high in the trees playing mellifluous tunes on their reed pipes while others stared at the sky with peaceful expressions neither awake nor asleep
one elf sat cross legged before a pottery wheel that whirled round and round with a steady rhythm while a delicate urn took form beneath his hands
