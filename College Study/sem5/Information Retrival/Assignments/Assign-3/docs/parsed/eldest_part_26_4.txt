roran **
perhaps we still have hope
he saw nolfavrell sitting alone on a log staring back toward palancar valley and joined the boy who looked at him seriously
are you leaving soon asked nolfavrell
roran nodded impressed by his poise and determination
you will do your best wo not you to kill the ra zac and avenge my father i would do it except that mama says i must guard my brothers and sisters
i will bring you their heads myself if i can promised roran
the boy is chin trembled
that is **
nolfavrell
roran paused as he searched for the right words
you are the only one here besides me who has killed a man
it does not mean that we are better or worse than anyone else but it means that i can trust you to fight well if you are attacked
when katrina comes here tomorrow will you make sure that she is well protected
nolfavrell is chest swelled with pride
i will guard her wherever she ** then he looked regretful
that is
when i do not have to look after
roran understood
oh your family comes first
but maybe katrina can stay in the tent with your brothers and sisters
yes said nolfavrell slowly
yes i think that would work
you can rely on me
thank ** roran clapped him on the shoulder
he could have asked an older and more capable person but the adults were too busy with their own responsibilities to defend katrina as he hoped
nolfavrell however would have the opportunity and inclination to assure that she remained ** can hold my place while we are apart
roran stood as birgit approached
eyeing him flatly she said come it is ** then she hugged her son and continued toward the falls with roran and the other villagers who were returning to carvahall
behind them everyone in the small camp clustered against the felled trees and stared forlornly out through their wooden bars
as roran proceeded about his work throughout the rest of the day he felt carvahall is emptiness deep inside
it was as if part of himself had been extracted and hidden in the spine
and with the children gone the village now felt like an armed camp
the change seemed to have made everyone grim and grave
when the sun finally sank into the waiting teeth of the spine roran climbed the hill to horst is house
he stopped before the front door and placed a hand on the knob but remained there unable to ** does this frighten me as much as fighting
in the end he forsook the front door entirely and went to the side of the house where he slipped into the kitchen and to his dismay saw elain knitting on one side of the table speaking to katrina who was opposite her
they both turned toward him and roran blurted are
are you all right
katrina came to his side
i am ** she smiled softly
it just was a terrible shock when father
when
she ducked her head for a moment
elain has been wonderfully kind to me
she agreed to lend me baldor is room for the night
i am glad you are better said roran
he hugged her trying to convey all of his love and adoration through that simple touch
elain wrapped up her knitting
come now
the sun has set and it is time you were off to bed katrina
roran reluctantly let go of katrina who kissed him on the cheek and said i will see you in the morning
he started to follow her out but stopped when elain said with a barbed tone ** her delicate face was hard and stern
elain waited until they heard the creak of stairs that indicated katrina was out of earshot
i hope that you meant every promise you gave that girl because if you did not i will call an assembly and have you exiled within a week
roran was dumbfounded
of course i meant them
i love her
katrina just surrendered everything she owned or cared about for ** elain stared up at him with unwavering eyes
i ve seen men who throw their affection at young maids like grain tossed at chickens
the maids sigh and weep and believe that they are special yet for the man it is only a trifling amusement
you have always been honorable roran but one is loins can turn even the most sensible person into a prancing booby or a sly wicked fox
are you one for katrina requires neither a fool a trickster nor even love what she requires above all else is a man who will provide for her
