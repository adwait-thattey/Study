the rings of his mail hauberk clinking hreidamar stood upright and said on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith orik as our new king
her red lips curving with amusement iorunn rose from her chair with a sinuous motion and in a low husky voice said it seems it falls to me to decide the outcome of today is meet
i have listened most carefully to your arguments nado and your arguments orik
while you have both made points i agree with upon a wide range of subjects the most important issue we must decide is whether to commit ourselves to the varden is campaign against the empire
if theirs were merely a war between rival clans it would not matter to me which side won and i certainly would not consider sacrificing our warriors for the benefit of outlanders
however this is not the case
far from it
if galbatorix emerges triumphant from this war not even the beor mountains will protect us from his wrath
if our realm is to survive we must see galbatorix overthrown
moreover it strikes me that hiding in caves and tunnels while others decide the fate of alagaesia is unbecoming for a race as old and as powerful as ours
when the chronicles of this age are written shall they say we fought alongside the humans and the elves as the heroes of old or that we sat cowering in our halls like frightened peasants while a battle raged outside our doors i for one know mine ** iorunn tossed back her hair then said on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith orik as our new **
the eldest of the five readers of law who stood against the circular wall stepped forward and struck the end of his polished staff against the stone floor and proclaimed all hail king orik the forty third king of tronjheim farthen dur and every knurla above and below the beor **
all hail king ** the clanmeet roared rising to their feet with a loud rustle of clothes and armor
his head swimming eragon did likewise aware that he was now in the presence of royalty
he glanced at nado but the dwarf is face was a dead eyed mask
the white bearded reader of law struck his staff against the floor again
let the scribes record at once the clanmeet is decision and let the news be spread to every person throughout the realm
** inform the mages with their scrying mirrors of what has transpired here today and then seek out the wardens of the mountain and tell them four beats upon the drum
four beats and swing your mallets as you have never swung them before in all your lives for we have a new king
four beats of such strength farthen dur itself shall ring with the ** tell them this i charge you
**
after the heralds departed orik pushed himself out of his chair and stood looking at the dwarves around him
his expression to eragon seemed somewhat dazed as if he had not actually expected to win the crown
for this great responsibility he said i thank ** he paused then continued mine only thought now is for the betterment of our nation and i shall pursue that goal without faltering until the day i return to the stone
then the clan chiefs came forward one by one and they knelt before orik and swore their fealty to him as his loyal subjects
when the time came for nado to pledge himself the dwarf displayed nothing of his sentiments but merely recited the phrases of the oath without inflection the words dropping from his mouth like bars of lead
a palpable sense of relief rippled through the clanmeet once he had finished
upon the conclusion of the oath giving orik decreed that his coronation would take place the following morning and then he and his attendants retired to an adjacent chamber
there eragon looked at orik and orik looked at eragon and neither made a sound until a broad smile appeared on orik is face and he broke out laughing his cheeks turning red
laughing with him eragon grasped him by a forearm and embraced him
orik is guards and advisers gathered around them clapping orik on the shoulder and congratulating him with hearty exclamations
eragon released orik saying i did not think iorunn would side with us
aye
i am glad she did but it complicates matters it ** orik grimaced
