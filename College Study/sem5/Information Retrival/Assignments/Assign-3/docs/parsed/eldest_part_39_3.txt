eragon was an exemplary human swordsman but he could not compete with warriors whose blood ran thick with magic
his arm was too weak and his reflexes too slow
still that did not stop him from trying to win
he fought to the limits of his abilities even if in the end it was a futile prospect
oromis tested him in every conceivable manner forcing eragon to utilize his entire arsenal of blows counterblows and underhand tricks
it was all for naught
he could not touch the elf
as a last resort he tried altering his style of fighting which could unsettle even the most hardened veteran
all it got him was a welt on his thigh
move your feet faster cried oromis
he who stands like a pillar dies in battle
he who bends like a reed is **
the elf was glorious in action a perfect blend of control and untamed violence
he pounced like a cat struck like a heron and bobbed and wove with the grace of a weasel
they had been sparring for almost twenty minutes when oromis faltered his narrow features clamped in a brief grimace
eragon recognized the symptoms of oromis is mysterious illness and lashed out with zar roc
it was a low thing to do but eragon was so frustrated he was willing to take advantage of any opening no matter how unfair just to have the satisfaction of marking oromis at least once
zar roc never reached its target
as eragon twisted he overextended and strained his back
the pain was upon him without warning
the last thing he heard was saphira shouting eragon
despite the intensity of the fit eragon remained conscious throughout his ordeal
not that he was aware of his surroundings only the fire that burned in his flesh and prolonged each second into an eternity
the worst part was that he could do nothing to end his suffering but wait
and wait
eragon lay panting in the cold mud
he blinked as his vision came into focus and he saw oromis sitting on a stool next to him
pushing himself onto his knees eragon surveyed his new tunic with a mixture of regret and disgust
the fine russet cloth was caked with dirt from his convulsions on the ground
muck filled his hair as well
he could sense saphira in his mind radiating concern as she waited for him to notice ** can you continue like this she ** will destroy you
her misgivings undermined eragon is remaining fortitude
saphira had never before expressed doubt that he would prevail not at dras leona gil ead or farthen dur nor with any of the dangers they had encountered
her confidence had given him courage
without it he was truly afraid
you should concentrate on your lesson he said
leave me ** snapped at her like a wounded animal that wants to nurse its injuries in silence and in dark
she fell silent leaving just enough of their connection intact so that he was vaguely aware of glaedr teaching her about fireweed which she could chew to help her digestion
eragon combed the mud from his hair with his fingers then spat out a globule of blood
bit my tongue
oromis nodded as if it were to be expected
do you require healing
very well
tend to your sword then bathe and go to the stump in the glade and listen to the thoughts of the forest
listen and when you hear no more come tell me what you have learned
as he sat on the stump eragon found that his turbulent thoughts and emotions prevented him from mustering the concentration to open his mind and sense the creatures in the hollow
nor was he interested in doing so
still the peaceful quality of his surroundings gradually ameliorated his resentment confusion and stubborn anger
it did not make him happy but it did bring him a certain fatalistic ** is my lot in life and i d better get used to it because it is not about to improve in the foreseeable future
after a quarter of an hour his faculties had regained their usual acuity so he resumed studying the colony of red ants that he had discovered the day before
he also tried to be aware of everything else that was happening in the glade as oromis had instructed
eragon met with limited success
if he relaxed and allowed himself to absorb input from all the consciousnesses nearby thousands of images and feelings rushed into his head piling on top of one another in quick flashes of sound and color touch and smell pain and pleasure
