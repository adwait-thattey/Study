knowing that what he and saphira had been given was worth several fortunes eragon bowed and said thank you for these gifts
hrothgar is presents are greatly appreciated
do not give thanks now said orik with a chuckle
wait until the armor saves your life
the warriors around them began marching away
the three battalions were repositioning themselves in different parts of farthen dur
unsure of what they should do eragon looked at orik who shrugged and said i suppose we should accompany ** they trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the crater wall
eragon asked about the urgals but orik only knew that scouts had been posted underground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet
the battalion halted at one of the collapsed tunnels
the dwarves had piled the rubble so that anyone inside the tunnel could easily climb ** must be one of the places they re going to force the urgals to surface saphira pointed out
hundreds of lanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground
they provided a great pool of light that glowed like an evening sun
fires blazed along the rim of the tunnel is roof huge cauldrons of pitch heating over them
eragon looked away fighting back revulsion
it was a terrible way to kill anyone even an urgal
rows of sharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny barrier between the battalion and the tunnel
eragon saw an opportunity to help and joined a group of men digging trenches between the saplings
saphira assisted as well scooping out the dirt with her giant claws
while they labored orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the archers
eragon drank gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed around
after the trenches were finished and filled with pointed stakes saphira and eragon rested
orik returned to find them seated together
he wiped his brow
all the men and dwarves are on the battlefield
tronjheim has been sealed off
hrothgar has taken charge of the battalion to our left
ajihad leads the one ahead of us
** orik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground
saphira nudged **
his hand tightened on zar roc as he saw murtagh helmed carrying a dwarven shield and his hand and a half sword approaching with tornac
orik cursed and leapt to his feet but murtagh said quickly it is all right ajihad released me
why would he do that demanded orik
murtagh smiled wryly
he said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions
apparently he does not think i would be able to do much damage even if i did turn on the varden
eragon nodded in welcome relaxing his grip
murtagh was an excellent and merciless fighter exactly whom eragon wanted by his side during battle
how do we know you re not lying asked orik
because i say so announced a firm voice
ajihad strode into their midst armed for battle with a breastplate and an ivory handled sword
he put a strong hand on eragon is shoulder and drew him away where the others could not hear
he cast an eye over eragon is armor
good orik outfitted you
yes
has anything been seen in the tunnels
** ajihad leaned on his sword
one of the twins is staying in tronjheim
he is going to watch the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his brother to me
i know you can speak with your mind
i need you to tell the twins anything anything unusual that you see while fighting
also i will relay orders to you through them
do you understand
the thought of being linked to the twins filled eragon with loathing but he knew it was necessary
i do
ajihad paused
you re not a foot soldier or horseman nor any other type of warrior i am used to commanding
battle may prove differently but i think you and saphira will be safer on the ground
in the air you will be a choice target for urgal archers
will you fight from saphira is back
eragon had never been in combat on horseback much less on saphira
i am not sure what we will do
when i am on saphira i am up too high to fight all but a kull
there will be plenty of kull i am afraid said ajihad
he straightened pulling his sword out of the ground
