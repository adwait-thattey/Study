i do not know anyone who can climb through a knot of thorny vines
roran grinned
that is a great idea
also those of you with sons have them harness your horses so we can drag the trees ** the men agreed and scattered through carvahall to gather axes and saws for the job
roran stopped darmmen and said make sure that the trees have branches all along the trunk or else they wo not work
where will you be asked darmmen
working on another line of ** roran left him then and ran to quimby is house where he found birgit busy boarding up the windows
yes she said looking at him
he quickly explained his plan with the trees
i want to dig a trench inside the ring of trees to slow down anyone who gets through
we could even put pointed stakes in the bottom of it and
i d like you to organize every woman and child and everyone else you can to dig
it is too much for me to handle by myself and we do not have long
roran looked her straight in the eyes
please
because like me you hate the ra zac and i know you will do everything possible to stop them
aye whispered birgit then clapped her hands briskly
very well as you wish
but i will never forget roran garrowsson that it was you and your family who brought about my husband is ** she strode away before roran could respond
he accepted her animosity with equanimity it was to be expected considering her loss
he was only lucky she had not started a blood feud
then he shook himself and ran to where the main road entered carvahall
it was the weakest spot in the village and had to be doubly ** ra zac can not be allowed to just blast their way in again
roran recruited baldor and together they began excavating a ditch across the road
i will have to go soon warned baldor between strokes of his pickax
dad needs me in the forge
roran grunted an acknowledgment without looking up
as he worked his mind once again filled with memories of the soldiers how they had looked as he struck them and the feeling the horriblefeeling of smashing a body as if it were a rotten stump
he paused nauseated and noted the commotion throughout carvahall as people readied themselves for the next assault
after baldor left roran completed the thigh deep ditch himself then went to fisk is workshop
with the carpenter is permission he had five logs from the stockpile of seasoned wood pulled by horses back to the main road
there roran tipped the logs on end into the trench so that they formed an impenetrable barrier into carvahall
as he tamped down the earth around the logs darmmen trotted up
we got the trees
they re just being put into place ** roran accompanied him to carvahall is northern edge where twelve men wrestled four lush green pines into alignment while a team of draft horses under the whip of a young boy returned to the foothills
most of us are helping to retrieve the trees
the others got inspired they seemed determined to chop down the rest of the forest when i left
good we can use the extra timber
darmmen pointed to a pile of dense brambles that sat on the edge of kiselt is fields
i cut those along the anora
use them however you want
i am going to find more
roran clapped him on the arm then turned toward the eastern side of carvahall where a long curved line of women children and men labored in the dirt
he went to them and found birgit issuing orders like a general and distributing water among the diggers
the trench was already five feet wide and two feet deep
when birgit paused for breath he said i am impressed
she brushed back a lock of hair without looking at him
we plowed the ground to begin with
it made things easier
do you have a shovel i can use he asked
birgit pointed to a mound of tools at the other end of the trench
as roran walked toward it he spied the copper gleam of katrina is hair in the midst of the bobbing backs
beside her sloan hacked at the soft loam with a furious obsessive energy as if he were attempting to tear open the earth is skin to peel back its clay hide and expose the muscle beneath
his eyes were wild and his teeth were bared in a knotted grimace despite the flecks of dirt and filth that spotted his lips
