the closer they got to the ground the slower they went
a crushing fatigue overcame eragon reducing the distance he was able to traverse in a single stretch and making it increasingly difficult for him to recuperate during the pauses between his bursts of exertion
even lifting a finger became a task that he found irritating in the extreme as well as one that was almost unbearably laborious
drowsiness muffled him in its warm folds and dulled his thoughts and feelings until the hardest of rocks seemed as soft as pillows to his aching muscles
when he finally dropped onto the sun baked soil too weak to keep sloan and himself from ramming into the dirt eragon lay with his arms folded at odd angles underneath his chest and stared with half lidded eyes into the yellow flecks of citrine embedded within the small rock an inch or two from his nose
sloan weighed on his back like a pile of iron ingots
air seeped from eragon is lungs but none seemed to return
his vision darkened as if a cloud had covered the sun
a deadly lull separated each beat of his heart and the throb when it came was no more than a faint flutter
eragon was no longer capable of coherent thought but somewhere in the back of his brain he was aware that he was about to die
it did not frighten him to the contrary the prospect comforted him for he was tired beyond belief and death would free him from the battered shell of his flesh and allow him to rest for all of eternity
from above and behind his head there came a bumblebee as big as his thumb
it circled his ear then hovered by the rock probing the nodes of citrine which were the same bright yellow as the fieldstars that bloomed among the hills
the bumblebee is mane glowed in the morning light each hair sharp and distinct to eragon and its blurred wings generated a gentle bombilation like a tattoo played on a drum
pollen powdered the bristles on its legs
the bumblebee was so vibrant so alive and so beautiful its presence renewed eragon is will to survive
a world that contained a creature as amazing as that bumblebee was a world he wanted to live in
by sheer force of will he pushed his left hand free of his chest and grasped the woody stem of a nearby shrub
like a leech or a tick or some other parasite he extracted the life from the plant leaving it limp and brown
the subsequent rush of energy that coursed through eragon sharpened his wits
now he was scared having regained his desire to continue existing he found nothing but terror in the blackness beyond
dragging himself forward he seized another shrub and transferred its vitality into his body then a third shrub and a fourth shrub and so on until he once again possessed the full measure of his strength
he stood and looked back at the trail of brown plants that stretched out behind him a bitter taste filled his mouth as he saw what he had wrought
eragon knew that he had been careless with the magic and that his reckless behavior would have doomed the varden to certain defeat if he had died
in hindsight his stupidity made him wince
brom would box my ears for getting into this mess he thought
returning to sloan eragon hoisted the gaunt butcher off the ground
then he turned east and loped away from helgrind and into the concealment of a draw
ten minutes later when he paused to check for pursuers he saw a cloud of dirt swirling at the base of helgrind which he took to mean that the horsemen had arrived at the dark tower of stone
he smiled
galbatorix is minions were too far away for any lesser magicians among their ranks to detect his or sloan is minds
by the time they discover the ra zac is bodies he thought i shall have run a league or more
i doubt they will be able to find me then
besides they will be searching for a dragon and her rider not a man traveling on foot
satisfied that he did not have to worry about an imminent attack eragon resumed his previous pace a steady effortless stride that he could maintain for the entire day
above him the sun gleamed gold and white
before him trackless wilderness extended for many leagues before lapping against the outbuildings of some village
