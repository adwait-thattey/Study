oromis hesitated and it was glaedr who answered
little one he said startling eragon with the use of the epithet even if the ground were covered with eldunari our race would still be doomed
a dragon preserved within an eldunari is still a dragon but they possess neither the urges of the flesh nor the organs with which to fulfill them
they cannot reproduce
the base of eragon is skull began to throb and he became increasingly aware of his weariness from the past four days of traveling
his exhaustion made it difficult to keep hold of thoughts for more than a few moments at the slightest distraction they slipped out of his grasp
the tip of saphira is tail twitched
i am not so ignorant as to believe that eldunari could beget offspring
however it comforts me to know i am not as alone as i once thought
our race may be doomed but at least there are more than four dragons alive in the world whether they be cloaked in their flesh or not
that is true said oromis but they are as much galbatorix is captives as murtagh and thorn
freeing them gives me something to strive for though along with rescuing the last egg said saphira
it is something for us both to strive for said eragon
we are their only ** he rubbed his brow with his right thumb then said there is still something i do not understand
oh asked oromis
wherein lies your confusion
if galbatorix draws his power from these hearts how do they produce the energy he uses eragon paused searching for a better way to phrase his question
he gestured at the swallows flitting about in the sky
every living thing eats and drinks to sustain itself even plants
food provides the energy our bodies need to function properly
it also provides the energy we need to work magic whether we rely upon our own strength to cast a spell or make use of the strength of others
how can that be though with these eldunari they do not have bones and muscles and skin do they they do not eat do they so then how do they survive where does their energy come from
oromis smiled his longish teeth glossy as enameled porcelain
from magic
if one defines magic as the manipulation of energy which properly it is then yes magic
where exactly the eldunari acquire their energy is a mystery to both us and the dragons no one has ever identified the source
it may be they absorb sunlight as do plants or that they feed off the life forces of the creatures closest to them
whatever the answer it has been proven that when a dragon undergoes body death and their consciousness takes up sole residence in their heart of hearts they bring with them however much spare strength was available within their body when it ceased to function
thereafter their store of energy increases at a steady pace for the next five to seven years until they attain the full height of their power which is immense indeed
the total amount of energy an eldunari can hold depends upon the size of the heart the older a dragon the larger their eldunari and the more energy it can absorb before becoming saturated
thinking back to when he and saphira had battled murtagh and thorn eragon said galbatorix must have given murtagh several eldunari
that is the only explanation for his increase in strength
oromis nodded
you are fortunate galbatorix did not lend him any more hearts else it would have been easy for murtagh to overwhelm you arya and all the other spellcasters with the varden
eragon remembered how both times he and saphira had encountered murtagh and thorn murtagh is mind had felt as if it contained multiple beings
eragon shared his recollection with saphira and said those must have been the eldunari i sensed
i wonder where murtagh put them thorn carried no saddlebags and i did not see any odd bulges in murtagh is clothing
i do not know said saphira
you do realize that murtagh must have been referring to his eldunari when he said that instead of tearing out your own heart it would be better to tear out his hearts
hearts not heart
you re ** maybe he was trying to warn me
inhaling eragon loosened the knot between his shoulder blades and leaned back in his chair
