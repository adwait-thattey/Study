instead we are wounded at the height of our triumph
eragon softly told him about arya and the disappearance of the twins and murtagh
she should not have gone said jormundur straightening but we can do naught about it now
guards will be posted here but it will be at least an hour before dwarf guides can be found for another expedition into the tunnels
i d be willing to lead it offered orik
jormundur looked back at tronjheim his gaze distant
no hrothgar will need you now someone else will have to go
i am sorry eragon but everyone importantmust stay here until ajihad is successor is chosen
arya will have to fend for herself
we could not overtake her anyway
jormundur swept his gaze around before saying so all could hear ajihad has died a warrior is ** look he slew five urgals where a lesser man might have been overwhelmed by one
we will give him every honor and hope his spirit pleases the gods
bear him and our companions back to tronjheim on your shields
and do not be ashamed to let your tears be seen for this is a day of sorrow that all will remember
may we soon have the privilege of sheathing our blades in the monsters who have slain our **
as one the warriors knelt baring their heads in homage to ajihad
then they stood and reverently lifted him on their shields so he lay between their shoulders
already many of the varden wept tears flowing into beards yet they did not disgrace their duty and allow ajihad to fall
with solemn steps they marched back to tronjheim saphira and eragon in the middle of the procession
