i wish i had what they have she thought
her responsibilities prevented her from entertaining girlish dreams of romance and marriage and certainly children unless she were to arrange a marriage of convenience for the good of the varden
she had often considered doing that with orrin but her nerve always failed her
still she was content with her lot and did not begrudge katrina and roran their happiness
her cause was what she cared about defeating galbatorix was far more important than something as trifling as marriage
most everyone got married but how many had the opportunity to oversee the birth of a new age
i am not myself this evening realized nasuada
my wounds have set my thoughts ahumming like a nest of bees
shaking herself she looked past roran and katrina to saphira
nasuada opened up the barriers she usually maintained around her mind so she might hear what saphira had to say and then asked where is he
with the dry rustle of scales sliding over scales saphira crept forward and lowered her neck so her head was directly in front of nasuada arya and angela
the dragon is left eye sparkled with blue fire
she sniffed twice and her crimson tongue darted out of her mouth
hot moist breath ruffled the lace collar on nasuada is dress
nasuada swallowed as saphira is consciousness brushed against her own
saphira felt unlike any other being nasuada had encountered ancient alien and both ferocious and gentle
that along with saphira is imposing physical presence always reminded nasuada that if saphira wanted to eat them she could
it was impossible nasuada believed to be complacent around a dragon
i smell blood said saphira
who has hurt you nasuada name them and i shall tear them from neck to groin and bring you their heads for trophies
there is no need for you to tear anyone apart
not yet at least
i wielded the knife myself
however this is the wrong time to delve into the matter
right now all i care about is eragon is whereabouts
eragon said saphira decided to remain in the empire
for a few seconds nasuada was unable to move or think
then a mounting sense of doom replaced her stunned denial of saphira is revelation
the others reacted in various ways as well from which nasuada deduced saphira had spoken to them all at once
how
how could you allow him to stay she asked
small tongues of fire rippled in saphira is nostrils as she snorted
eragon made his own choice
i could not stop him
he insists upon doing what he thinks is right no matter the consequences for him or the rest of alagaesia
i could shake him like a hatchling but i am proud of him
fear not he can take care of himself
so far no misfortune has befallen him
i would know if he was hurt
arya spoke and why did he make this choice saphira
it would be faster for me to show you rather than explain with words
may i
a river of saphira is memories poured into nasuada
she saw black helgrind from above a layer of clouds heard eragon roran and saphira discussing how best to attack watched them discover the ra zac is lair and experienced saphira is epic battle with the lethrblaka
the procession of images fascinated nasuada
she had been born in the empire but could remember nothing of it this was the first time as an adult that she had looked upon anything besides the wild fringes of galbatorix is holdings
lastly came eragon and his confrontation with saphira
saphira attempted to hide it but the anguish she felt over leaving eragon was still so raw and piercing nasuada had to dry her cheeks with the bandages on her forearms
however the reasons eragon gave for staying killing the last ra zac and exploring the remainder of helgrind were reasons nasuada deemed inadequate
she frowned
eragon may be rash but he is certainly not foolish enough to endanger everything we seek to accomplish merely so he could visit a few caves and drain the last bitter dregs of his revenge
there must be another explanation
she wondered whether she should press saphira for the truth but she knew saphira would not withhold such information on a whim
perhaps she wants to discuss it in private she thought
