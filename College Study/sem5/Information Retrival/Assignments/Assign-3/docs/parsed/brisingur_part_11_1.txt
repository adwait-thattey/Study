the pounding beat of his stride originated in his heels and ran up his legs through his hips and along his spine until it terminated at the base of his skull where the recurring impact jarred his teeth and exacerbated the headache that seemed to worsen with every passing mile
the monotonous music of his running had annoyed him at first but before long it lulled him into a trancelike state where he did not think but moved
as eragon is boots descended he heard brittle stalks of grass snap like twigs and glimpsed puffs of dirt rising from the cracked soil
he guessed it had been at least a month since it last rained in this part of alagaesia
the dry air leached the moisture from his breath leaving his throat raw
no matter how much he drank he could not compensate for the amount of water the sun and the wind stole from him
helgrind was far behind him
however he had made slower progress than he had hoped
hundreds of galbatorix is patrols containing both soldiers and magicians swarmed across the land and he often had to hide in order to avoid them
that they were searching for him he had no doubt
the previous evening he had even spotted thorn riding low on the western horizon
he had immediately shielded his mind thrown himself into a ditch and stayed there for half an hour until thorn dipped back down below the edge of the world
eragon had decided to travel on established roads and trails wherever possible
the events of the past week had pushed him to the limits of his physical and emotional endurance
he preferred to allow his body to rest and recover rather than strain himself forging through brambles over hills and across muddy rivers
the time for desperate violent exertion would come again but now was not it
so long as he held to the roads he dared not run as fast as he was capable indeed it would be wiser to avoid running altogether
a fair number of villages and outbuildings were scattered throughout the area
if any of the inhabitants observed a lone man sprinting across the countryside as if a pack of wolves were chasing him the spectacle would be sure to arouse curiosity and suspicion and might even inspire a frightened crofter to report the incident to the empire
that could prove fatal for eragon whose greatest defense was the cloak of anonymity
he only ran now because he had encountered no living creatures except a long snake sunning itself for over a league
returning to the varden was eragon is primary concern and it rankled him to plod along like a common vagabond
still he appreciated the opportunity to be by himself
he had not been alone truly alone since he found saphira is egg in the spine
always her thoughts had rubbed against his or brom or murtagh or someone else had been at his side
in addition to the burden of constant companionship eragon had spent all the months since he had left palancar valley engaged in arduous training breaking only for travel or to take part in the tumult of battle
never before had he concentrated so intensely for so long or dealt with such huge amounts of worry and fear
he welcomed his solitude then and the peace it brought
the absence of voices including his own was a sweet lullaby that for a short while washed away his fear of the future
he had no desire to scry saphira although they were too far apart to touch each other is minds his bond with her would tell him if she was hurt or to contact arya or nasuada and hear their angry words
far better he thought to listen to the songs of the flitting birds and the sighing of the breeze through the grass and leafy branches
the only cover close to eragon was a small thicket of juniper trees
he sprinted toward it and dove under the drooping branches just as six soldiers emerged from the ravine and rode cantering out onto the thin dirt road not ten feet away
normally eragon would have sensed their presence long before they got so close but since thorn is distant appearance he had kept his mind walled off from his surroundings
the soldiers reined in their horses and milled around in the middle of the road arguing among themselves
