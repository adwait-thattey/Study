they all turned to look as roran entered the assembly
horst said ah you made it
you escaped misfortune while in the spine
with what exactly roran hitched the mare to an anvil as he spoke
loring answered the shoemaker is parchment face a mass of contorting lines and grooves
we have attempted reason with these ra zac
theseinvaders
he stopped his thin frame racked with an unpleasant metallic wheeze deep in his chest
they have refusedreason
they have endangered us all with no sign of remorse orcontrition
he made a noise in his throat then said with pronounced deliberation they
must
go
such creatures
no said roran
not creatures
desecrators
the faces scowled and bobbed in agreement
delwin picked up the thread of conversation the point is everyone is life is at stake
if that fire had spread any farther dozens of people would have been killed and those who escaped would have lost everything they own
as a result we ve agreed to drive the ra zac away from carvahall
will you join us
roran hesitated
what if they return or send for reinforcements we can not defeat the entire empire
no said horst grave and solemn but neither can we stand silent and allow the soldiers to kill us and to destroy our property
a man can endure only so much abuse before he must strike back
loring laughed throwing back his head so the flame gilded the stumps of his teeth
first we fortify he whispered with glee then we fight
we will make them regret they ever clapped their festering eyes on ** ha **
