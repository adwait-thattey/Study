the hadarac desert filled the center of the map the east end was blank
somewhere in that void hid the varden
to the south was surda a small country that had seceded from the empire after the riders fall
eragon had been told that surda secretly supported the varden
near surda is eastern border was a mountain range labeled beor mountains
eragon had heard of them in many stories they were supposed to be ten times the height of the spine though he privately believed that was exaggeration
the map was empty to the east of the beors
five islands rested off the coast of surda nia parlim uden illium and beirland
nia was no more than an outcropping of rock but beirland the largest had a small town
farther up near teirm was a jagged island called sharktooth
and high to the north was one more island immense and shaped like a knobby hand
eragon knew its name without even looking vroengard the ancestral home of the riders once a place of glory but now a looted empty shell haunted by strange beasts
in the center of vroengard was the abandoned city of doru areaba
carvahall was a small dot at the top of palancar valley
level with it but across the plains sprawled the forest du weldenvarden
like the beor mountains its eastern end was unmapped
parts of du weldenvarden is western edge had been settled but its heart lay mysterious and unexplored
the forest was wilder than the spine the few who braved its depths often came back raving mad or not at all
eragon shivered as he saw uru baen in the center of the empire
king galbatorix ruled from there with his black dragon shruikan by his side
eragon put his finger on uru baen
the ra zac are sure to have a hiding place here
you had better hope that that is not their only sanctuary said brom flatly
otherwise you will never get near ** he pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands
jeod took the parchment out of his pouch and said from what i saw in the records there have been shipments of seithr oil to every major city in the empire over the past five years
as far as i can tell all of them might have been ordered by wealthy jewelers
i am not sure how we can narrow down the list without more information
brom swept a hand over the map
i think we can eliminate some cities
the ra zac have to travel wherever the king wants and i am sure he keeps them busy
if they re expected to go anywhere at anytime the only reasonable place for them to stay is at a crossroads where they can reach every part of the country fairly ** he was excited now and paced the room
this crossroads has to be large enough so the ra zac will be inconspicuous
it also has to have enough trade so any unusual requests special food for their mounts for example will go unnoticed
that makes sense said jeod nodding
under those conditions we can ignore most of the cities in the north
the only big ones are teirm gil ead and ceunon
i know they re not in teirm and i doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the coast to narda it is too small
ceunon is too isolated
only gil ead remains
the ra zac might be there conceded brom
it would have a certain irony
it would at that jeod acknowledged softly
what about southern cities asked eragon
well said jeod
there is obviously uru baen but that is an unlikely destination
if someone were to die from seithr oil in galbatorix is court it would be all too easy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the empire had been buying large amounts of it
that still leaves many others any one of which could be the one we want
yes said eragon but the oil was not sent to all of them
the parchment only lists kuasta dras leona aroughs and belatona
kuasta would not work for the ra zac it is on the coast and surrounded by mountains
aroughs is isolated like ceunon though it is a center of trade
that leaves belatona and dras leona which are rather close together
of the two i think dras leona is the likelier
it is larger and better situated
and that is where nearly all the goods of the empire pass through at one time or another including teirm is said jeod
it would be a good place for the ra zac to hide
