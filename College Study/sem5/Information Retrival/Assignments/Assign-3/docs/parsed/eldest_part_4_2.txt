it surprised eragon how much people is attitudes toward murtagh had changed considering that murtagh is father was the dragon rider morzan who had betrayed the riders to galbatorix
even though murtagh despised his father and was loyal to eragon the varden had not trusted him
but now no one was willing to waste energy on a petty hate when so much work remained
eragon missed talking with murtagh and looked forward to discussing all that had happened once he returned
as eragon and saphira rounded tronjheim a small group became visible in the pool of lantern light before the timber gate
among them were orik the dwarf shifting impatiently on his stout legs and arya
the white bandage around her upper arm gleamed in the darkness reflecting a faint highlight onto the bottom of her hair
eragon felt a strange thrill as he always did when he saw the elf
she looked at him and saphira green eyes flashing then continued watching for ajihad
by breaking isidar mithrim the great star sapphire that was sixty feet across and carved in the shape of a rose arya had allowed eragon to kill durza and so win the battle
still the dwarves were furious with her for destroying their most prized treasure
they refused to move the sapphire is remains leaving them in a massive circle inside tronjheim is central chamber
eragon had walked through the splintered wreckage and shared the dwarves sorrow for all the lost beauty
he and saphira stopped by orik and looked out at the empty land that surrounded tronjheim extending to farthen dur is base five miles away in each direction
where will ajihad come from asked eragon
orik pointed at a cluster of lanterns staked around a large tunnel opening a couple of miles away
he should be here soon
eragon waited patiently with the others answering comments directed at him but preferring to speak with saphira in the peace of his mind
the quiet that filled farthen dur suited him
half an hour passed before motion flickered in the distant tunnel
a group of ten men climbed out onto the ground then turned and helped up as many dwarves
one of the men eragon assumed it was ajihad raised a hand and the warriors assembled behind him in two straight lines
at a signal the formation marched proudly toward tronjheim
before they went more than five yards the tunnel behind them swarmed with a flurry of activity as more figures jumped out
eragon squinted unable to see clearly from so far away
those are ** saphira her body tensing like a drawn bowstring
eragon did not question her
** he cried and leaped onto saphira berating himself for leaving his sword zar roc in his room
no one had expected an attack now that the urgal army had been driven away
his wound twinged as saphira lifted her azure wings then drove them down and jumped forward gaining speed and altitude each second
below them arya ran toward the tunnel nearly keeping apace with saphira
orik trailed her with several men while jormundur sprinted back toward the barracks
eragon was forced to watch helplessly as the urgals fell on the rear of ajihad is warriors he could not work magic over such a distance
the monsters had the advantage of surprise and quickly cut down four men forcing the rest of the warriors men and dwarves alike to cluster around ajihad in an attempt to protect him
swords and axes clashed as the groups pressed together
light flashed from one of the twins and an urgal fell clutching the stump of his severed arm
for a minute it seemed the defenders would be able to resist the urgals but then a swirl of motion disturbed the air like a faint band of mist wrapping itself around the combatants
when it cleared only four warriors were standing ajihad the twins and murtagh
the urgals converged on them blocking eragon is view as he stared with rising horror and fear
before saphira could reach the fight the knot of urgals streamed back to the tunnel and scrambled underground leaving only prone forms behind
the moment saphira touched down eragon vaulted off then faltered overcome by grief and ** can not do this
it reminded him too much of when he had returned to the farm to find his uncle garrow dying
