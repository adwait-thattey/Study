it
murtagh faltered and rubbed his face
my main worry now is how we re going to travel with so many men searching for us
gil ead is soldiers will be hunting us tomorrow once they find the horses tracks they will know you did not fly away with saphira
eragon glumly agreed
how did you manage to get into the castle
murtagh laughed softly
by paying a steep bribe and crawling through a filthy scullery chute
but the plan would not have worked without saphira
she he stopped and directed his words at her that is you are the only reason we escaped alive
eragon solemnly put a hand on her scaly neck
as she hummed contentedly he gazed at the elf is face captivated
reluctantly he dragged himself upright
we should make a bed for her
murtagh got to his feet and stretched out a blanket for the elf
when they lifted her onto it the cuff of her sleeve tore on a branch
eragon began to pinch the fabric together then gasped
the elf is arm was mottled with a layer of bruises and cuts some were half healed while others were fresh and oozing
eragon shook his head with anger and pulled the sleeve up higher
the injuries continued to her shoulder
with trembling fingers he unlaced the back of her shirt dreading what might be under it
as the leather slipped off murtagh cursed
the elf is back was strong and muscled but it was covered with scabs that made her skin look like dry cracked mud
she had been whipped mercilessly and branded with hot irons in the shape of claws
where her skin was still intact it was purple and black from numerous beatings
on her left shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink
it was the same symbol that had been on the sapphire of brom is ring
eragon silently swore an oath that he would kill whoever was responsible for torturing the elf
can you heal this asked murtagh
i i do not know said eragon
he swallowed back sudden queasiness
there is so much
** saphira ** is an elf
she cannot be allowed to die
tired or not hungry or not you must save her
i will meld my strength with yours but you are the one who must wield the magic
yes
you are right he murmured unable to tear his eyes from the elf
determined he pulled off his gloves and said to murtagh this is going to take some time
can you get me food also boil rags for bandages i can not heal all her wounds
we can not make a fire without being seen objected murtagh
you will have to use unwashed cloths and the food will be ** eragon grimaced but acquiesced
as he gently laid a hand on the elf is spine saphira settled next to him her glittering eyes fixed on the elf
he took a deep breath then reached for the magic and started working
he spoke the ancient words waise ** a burn shimmered under his palm and new unmarked skin flowed over it joining together without a scar
he passed over bruises or other wounds that were not life threatening healing them all would consume the energy he needed for more serious injuries
as eragon toiled he marveled that the elf was still alive
she had been repeatedly tortured to the edge of death with a precision that chilled him
although he tried to preserve the elf is modesty he could not help but notice that underneath the disfiguring marks her body was exceptionally beautiful
he was exhausted and did not dwell upon it though his ears turned red at times and he fervently hoped that saphira did not know what he was thinking
he labored through dawn pausing only at brief intervals to eat and drink trying to replenish himself from his fast the escape and now healing the elf
saphira remained by his side lending her strength where she could
the sun was well into the sky when he finally stood groaning as his cramped muscles stretched
his hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty
he stumbled to the saddlebags and took a long drink from the wineskin
is it done asked murtagh
eragon nodded trembling
he did not trust himself to speak
the camp spun before him he nearly ** did well said saphira soothingly
i do not do not know he said in a ravaged voice
elves are strong but even they cannot endure abuse like this with impunity
