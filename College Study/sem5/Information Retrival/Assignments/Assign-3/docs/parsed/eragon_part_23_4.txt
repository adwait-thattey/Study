as usual eragon dueled with brom before dinner
in the midst of the fight eragon delivered such a powerful blow that he snapped both of their sticks like twigs
the pieces whistled into the darkness in a cloud of splintered fragments
brom tossed what remained of his stick into the fire and said we re done with these throw yours in as well
you have learned well but we ve gone as far as we can with branches
there is nothing more you can gain from them
it is time for you to use the ** he removed zar roc from eragon is bag and gave it to him
we will cut each other to ribbons protested eragon
not so
again you forget magic said brom
he held up his sword and turned it so that firelight glinted off the edge
he put a finger on either side of the blade and focused intensely deepening the lines on his forehead
for a moment nothing happened then he uttered geuloth du ** and a small red spark jumped between his fingers
as it flickered back and forth he ran his fingers down the length of the sword
then he twirled it and did the same thing on the other side
the spark vanished the moment his fingers left the metal
brom held his hand out palm up and slashed it with the sword
eragon jumped forward but was too slow to stop him
he was astonished when brom raised his unharmed hand with a smile
what did you do asked eragon
feel the edge said brom
eragon touched it and felt an invisible surface under his fingers
the barrier was about a quarter inch wide and very slippery
now do the same on zar roc instructed brom
your block will be a bit different than mine but it should accomplish the same thing
he told eragon how to pronounce the words and coached him through the process
it took eragon a few tries but he soon had zar roc is edge protected
confident he took his fighting stance
before they started brom admonished these swords wo not cut us but they can still break bones
i would prefer to avoid that so do not flail around like you normally do
a blow to the neck could prove fatal
eragon nodded then struck without warning
sparks flew off his blade and the clash of metal filled their campsite as brom parried
the sword felt slow and heavy to eragon after fighting with sticks for so long
unable to move zar roc fast enough he received a sharp rap on his knee
they both had large welts when they stopped eragon more so than brom
he marveled that zar roc had not been scratched or dented by the vigorous pounding it had received
the next morning eragon woke with stiff limbs and purple bruises
he saw brom carry the saddle to saphira and tried to quell his uneasiness
by the time breakfast was ready brom had strapped the saddle onto saphira and hung eragon is bags from it
when his bowl was empty eragon silently picked up his bow and went to saphira
brom said now remember grip with your knees guide her with your thoughts and stay as flat as you can on her back
nothing will go wrong if you do not ** eragon nodded sliding his unstrung bow into its leather tube and brom boosted him into the saddle
saphira waited impatiently while eragon tightened the bands around his ** you ready she asked
he sucked in the fresh morning ** but let is do ** she agreed enthusiastically
he braced himself as she crouched
her powerful legs surged and the air whipped past him snatching his breath away
with three smooth strokes of her wings she was in the sky climbing rapidly
the last time eragon had ridden saphira every flap of her wings had been strained
now she flew steadily and effortlessly
he clenched his arms around her neck as she turned on edge banking
the river shrank to a wispy gray line beneath them
clouds floated around them
when they leveled off high above the plains the trees below were no more than specks
the air was thin chilly and perfectly clear
this is wonderfu his words were lost as saphira tilted and rolled completely around
the ground spun in a dizzying circle and vertigo clutched eragon
do not do ** he cried
i feel like i am going to fall off
you must become accustomed to it
if i am attacked in the air that is one of the simplest maneuvers i will do she replied
