your finger well at least you showed sense enough not to drink it
only a puddle would have been left of you
oil from the petals of the seithr plant which grows on a small island in the frigid northern seas
in its natural state the oil is used for preserving pearls it makes them lustrous and strong
but when specific words are spoken over the oil along with a blood sacrifice it gains the property to eat any flesh
that alone would not make it special there are plenty of acids that can dissolve sinew and bone except for the fact that it leaves everything else untouched
you can dip anything into the oil and pull it out unharmed unless it was once part of an animal or human
this has made it a weapon of choice for torture and assassination
it can be stored in wood slathered on the point of a spear or dripped onto sheets so that the next person to touch them will be burned
there are myriad uses for it limited only by your ingenuity
any injury caused by it is always slow to heal
it is rather rare and expensive especially this converted form
eragon remembered the terrible burns that had covered ** is what they used on him he realized with horror
i wonder why the ra zac left it behind if it is so valuable
it must have slipped off when they flew away
but why did not they come back for it i doubt that the king will be pleased that they lost it
no he wo not said brom but he would be even more displeased if they delayed bringing him news of you
in fact if the ra zac have reached him by now you can be sure that the king has learned your name
and that means we will have to be much more careful when we go into towns
there will be notices and alerts about you posted throughout the empire
eragon paused to think
this oil how rare is it exactly
like diamonds in a pig trough said brom
he amended himself after a second actually the normal oil is used by jewelers but only those who can afford it
so there are people who trade in it
good said eragon
now do the cities along the coast keep shipping records
brom is eyes brightened
of course they do
if we could get to those records they would tell us who brought the oil south and where it went from there
and the record of the empire is purchase will tell us where the ra zac ** concluded eragon
i do not know how many people can afford this oil but it should not be hard to figure out which ones are not working for the empire
** exclaimed brom smiling
i wish i had thought of this years ago it would have saved me many headaches
the coast is dotted with numerous cities and towns where ships can land
i suppose that teirm would be the place to start as it controls most of the ** brom paused
the last i heard my old friend jeod lives there
we have not seen each other for many years but he might be willing to help us
and because he is a merchant it is possible that he has access to those records
how do we get to teirm
we will have to go southwest until we reach a high pass in the spine
once on the other side we can head up the coast to teirm said brom
a gentle wind pulled at his hair
can we reach the pass within a week
easily
if we angle away from the ninor and to our right we might be able to see the mountains by tomorrow
eragon went to saphira and mounted her
i will see you at dinner ** when they were at a good height he said i am going to ride cadoc tomorrow
before you protest know that i am only doing it because i want to talk with brom
you should ride with him every other day
that way you can still receive your instruction and i will have time to hunt
you wo not be troubled by it
when they landed for the day he was pleased to discover that his legs did not hurt
the saddle had protected him well from saphira is scales
eragon and brom had their nightly fight but it lacked energy as both were preoccupied with the day is events
by the time they finished eragon is arms burned from zar roc is unaccustomed weight
the next day while they were riding eragon asked brom what is the sea like
you must have heard it described before said brom
yes but what is it really like
brom is eyes grew hazy as if he looked upon some hidden scene
