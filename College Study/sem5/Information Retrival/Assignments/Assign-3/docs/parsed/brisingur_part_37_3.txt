my blood still churns from the tumult of the fight and my thoughts are likewise uneasy
orik replied rest or not as you will you shall not disturb my slumber for i shall pull a thick woolen cap low over my eyes
i urge you to try and calm yourself however perhaps with some of the techniques the elves taught you and recover what strength you may
the new day is already upon us and but a few hours remain until the clanmeet shall be assembled
we should both be as fresh as possible for what is to come
what we do and say today shall determine the ultimate fate of mine people mine country and the rest of alagaesia
ah do not look so grim about the ** think of this instead whether success or failure awaits us and i surely hope we prevail our names shall be remembered until the end of time for how we comport ourselves at this clanmeet
that at least is an accomplishment to fill your belly with ** the gods are fickle and the only immortality we can count on is that which we win through our deeds
fame or infamy either one is preferable to being forgotten when you have passed from this realm
he was standing in horst is workshop the doors of which hung open loose upon their hinges like an idiot is slackjaw grin
outside was a starless night and the all consuming darkness seemed to press against the edges of the dull red light cast by the coals as if eager to devour everything within the scope of that ruddy sphere
next to the forge horst loomed like a giant the shifting shadows upon his face and beard fearsome to behold
his burly arm rose and fell and a bell like clang shivered the air as the hammer he wielded struck the end of a yellow glowing bar of steel
a burst of sparks extinguished itself on the ground
four more times the smith smote the metal then he lifted the bar from his anvil and plunged it into a barrel of oil
wraithlike flames blue and gossamer flickered across the surface of the oil and then vanished with small shrieks of fury
removing the bar from the barrel horst turned toward eragon and frowned at him
he said why have you come here eragon
i need a dragon rider is **
begone with you
i have no time to forge you a rider is sword
cannot you see i am working on a pothook for elain she must have it for the battle
are you alone
where is your father where is your mother
then a new voice sounded a well polished voice of strength and power and it said good smith he is not alone
he came with **
and who might you be demanded horst
between the gaping doors a huge figure rimmed with pale light emerged from the clotted darkness and stood upon the threshold of the workshop
a red cape billowed from shoulders wider than a kull is
in the man is left hand gleamed zar roc sharp as pain
through the slits of his brightly polished helm his blue eyes bored into eragon pinning him into place like an arrow through a rabbit
he lifted his free hand and held it out toward eragon
my son come with me
together we can destroy the varden kill galbatorix and conquer all of alagaesia
but give me your heart and we shall be invincible
give me your heart my **
with a strangled exclamation eragon leaped out of the couch and stood staring at the floor his fists clenched his chest heaving
orik is guards gave him inquisitive glances but he ignored them too upset to explain his outburst
the hour was still early so after a time eragon settled back onto the couch but thereafter he remained alert and did not allow himself to sink into the land of dreams for fear of what manifestations might torment him
eragon felt orik is boot nudge his own
without looking away from vermund eragon leaned over toward orik and heard him whisper remember to the left and three doorways down referring to the place where orik had stationed a hundred of his warriors without the other clan chiefs knowing
whispering as well eragon said if blood is shed should i seize the opportunity to kill that snake vermund
unless he is attempting the same with you or me please do ** a low chuckle emanated from orik
it would hardly endear you to the other grimstborithn
