could you get me some bread i need to ** murtagh quickly brought him part of a loaf
it was old and hard but eragon chewed on it gratefully
murtagh scanned the valley walls worry in his eyes
eragon knew he was searching for a way out
there will be one farther in
of course said murtagh with forced optimism then slapped his thigh
we must go
murtagh shrugged
the fever is worse
she is been tossing and turning
what do you expect her strength is failing
you should fly her to the varden before the poison does any more damage
i wo not leave you behind insisted eragon gaining strength with each bite
not with the urgals so near
murtagh shrugged again
as you wish
but i am warning you she wo not live if you stay with me
do not say that insisted eragon pushing himself upright in saphira is saddle
help me save her
we can still do it
consider it a life for a life atonement for torkenbrand is death
murtagh is face darkened instantly
it is not a debt owed
you he stopped as a horn echoed through the dark forest
i will have more to say to you later he said shortly stomping to the horses
he grabbed their reins and trotted away shooting an angry glare at eragon
eragon closed his eyes as saphira took flight
he wished that he could lie on a soft bed and forget all their troubles
saphira he said at last cupping his ears to warm them what if we did take arya to the varden once she was safe we could fly back to murtagh and help him out of here
the varden would not let you said ** all they know you might be returning to inform the urgals of their hiding place
we are not arriving under the best conditions to gain their trust
they will want to know why we ve brought an entire company of kull to their very gates
we will just have to tell them the truth and hope they believe us said eragon
and what will we do if the kull attack murtagh
fight them of ** i wo not let him and arya be captured or killed said eragon indignantly
there was a touch of sarcasm in her ** noble
oh we would fell many of the urgals you with magic and blade whilst my weapons would be tooth and claw but it would be futile in the end
they are too numerous
we cannot defeat them only be defeated
what then he ** will not leave arya or murtagh to their mercy
saphira waved her tail the tip whistling ** am not asking you to
however if we attack first we may gain the advantage
have you gone crazy they will
eragon is voice trailed off as he thought about ** wo not be able to do a thing he concluded surprised
exactly said ** can inflict lots of damage from a safe height
let is drop rocks on ** ** should scatter them
if their skulls are not thick enough to protect ** banked to the right and quickly descended to the beartooth river
she grasped a mid sized boulder with her strong talons while eragon scooped up several fist sized rocks
laden with the stones saphira glided on silent wings until they were over the urgal ** she exclaimed releasing the boulder
there were muffled cracks as the missiles plummeted through the forest top smashing branches
a second later howls echoed through the valley
eragon smiled tightly as he heard the urgals scramble for ** is find more ammunition he suggested bending low over saphira
she growled in agreement and returned to the riverbed
it was hard work but they were able to hinder the urgals progress though it was impossible to stop them altogether
the urgals gained ground whenever saphira went for stones
despite that their efforts allowed murtagh to stay ahead of the advancing column
the valley darkened as the hours slipped by
without the sun to provide warmth the sharp bite of frost crept into the air and the ground mist froze on the trees coating them white
night animals began to creep from their dens to peer from shadowed hideouts at the strangers trespassing on their land
eragon continued to examine the mountainsides searching for the waterfall that would signify the end of their journey
he was painfully aware that every passing minute brought arya closer to death
faster faster he muttered to himself looking down at murtagh
before saphira scooped up more rocks he said let is take a respite and check on arya
