he also sensed she was dissatisfied with how she had handled the sledgehammer while flattening the steel
rhunon is dissatisfaction continued to grow until she said ** look at these dents in the ** i cannot forge a blade like this
my control over your arms and hands is not fine enough to craft a sword worthy of note
before eragon could attempt to reason with her saphira said the tools do not the artist make rhunon elda
surely you can find a way to compensate for this inconvenience
inconvenience snorted rhunon
i have no more coordination than a fledgling
i am a stranger in a stranger is house
still grumbling she subsided into mental deliberations that were incomprehensible to eragon then said well i may have a solution but i warn you i shall not continue if i am unable to maintain my usual level of craftsmanship
she did not explain the solution to either eragon or saphira but one by one placed the plates of steel on the anvil and cracked them into flakes no wider than rose petals
gathering up half the flakes of the harder brightsteel rhunon stacked them into a brick which she then coated with clay and birch bark to hold them together
the brick went on a thick steel paddle with a seven foot long handle similar to those used by bakers to insert and remove loaves of bread from a hot oven
rhunon laid the end of the paddle in the center of the forge and then backed eragon as far away as she could and still have him hold on to the handle
then she asked saphira to resume breathing fire and again the atrium glowed with a flickering blue radiance
the heat was so intense eragon felt as if his exposed skin were crisping and he saw that the granite stones of which the forge was made had acquired a bright yellow glow
the brightsteel could easily have taken over half an hour to reach the appropriate temperature in a charcoal fire but it required only a few minutes in the withering inferno of saphira is flames before it turned white
the moment it did rhunon ordered saphira to cease breathing fire
darkness engulfed the forge as saphira closed her jaws
rushing eragon forward rhunon had him transport the glowing brick of clay covered steel to the anvil where she seized a hammer and welded the disparate flakes of brightsteel into a cohesive whole
she continued to pound on the metal elongating it out into a bar then made a cut in the middle folded the metal back on itself and welded the two pieces together
the bell like peals of ringing metal echoed off the ancient trees that surrounded the atrium
rhunon had eragon return the brightsteel to the forge once its color had faded from white to yellow and again saphira bathed the metal with the fire from her belly
six times rhunon heated and folded the brightsteel and each time the metal became smoother and more flexible until it could bend without tearing
as eragon hammered the steel his every action dictated by rhunon the elf woman began to sing both with his tongue and her own
together their voices formed a not unpleasant harmony that rose and fell with the beats of the hammer
a tingle crawled down eragon is spine as he felt rhunon channel a steady flow of energy into the words they were mouthing and he realized that the song contained spells of making shaping and binding
with their voices two rhunon sang of the metal that lay on the anvil describing its properties altering them in ways that exceeded eragon is understanding and imbuing the brightsteel with a complex web of enchantments designed to give it strength and resilience beyond that of any ordinary metal
of eragon is hammer arm rhunon also sang and under the gentle influence of her crooning every blow she struck with his arm landed upon its intended target
rhunon quenched the bar of brightsteel after the sixth and final fold was complete
she repeated the entire process with the other half of the hard brightsteel forging an identical bar to the first
then she gathered up the fragments of the softer steel which she folded and welded ten times before forming it into a short heavy wedge
