murmuring into eragon is left ear hundfast translated on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith orik as our new king
eragon released his pent up breath
one
in order to become ruler of the dwarves a clan chief had to win a majority of the votes from the other chiefs
if none achieved that feat then according to dwarvish law the clan chief with the least votes would be eliminated from the competition and the meet could adjourn for up to three days before voting again
the process would continue as needed until a clan chief had achieved the necessary majority at which point the meet would swear fealty to him or her as their new monarch
considering how pressed for time the varden were eragon fervently hoped that the voting would not require more than one round and if it did that the dwarves would not insist upon taking a recess of more than a few hours
if that happened he thought he might break the stone table in the center of the room out of frustration
that hadfala the first clan chief to vote had cast her lot with orik boded well
hadfala as eragon knew had been backing gannel of durgrimst quan before the attempt on eragon is life
if hadfala is allegiances had shifted then it was also possible that the other member of gannel is cohort namely grimstborith undin might also give his vote to orik
next galdhiem of durgrimst feldunost rose from the table although he was so short he was taller sitting than he was standing
on behalf of mine clan he declared i vote for grimstborith nado as our new king
turning his head to one side orik looked back at eragon and said to him in an undertone well that was as we expected
eragon nodded and glanced over at nado
the round faced dwarf was stroking the end of his yellow beard appearing pleased with himself
then manndrath of durgrimst ledwonnu said on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith orik as our new ** orik nodded toward him in thanks and manndrath nodded in return the tip of his long nose bobbing
as manndrath sat eragon and everyone else looked at gannel and the room became so quiet eragon could not even hear the dwarves breathing
as chief of the religious clan the quan and the high priest of guntera king of the dwarf gods gannel carried enormous influence among his race however he chose so the crown was likely to go
on behalf of mine clan gannel said i vote for grimstborith nado as our new king
a wave of soft exclamations broke out among the dwarves watching from the perimeter of the circular room and nado is pleased expression broadened
clenching his interlaced hands eragon silently cursed
do not give up hope yet lad orik muttered
we may yet pull through
it is happened before that the grimstborith of the quan has lost the vote
how often does it happen though whispered eragon
orik shifted and glanced away
eight hundred and twenty four years ago when queen
he fell silent as undin of durgrimst ragni hefthyn proclaimed on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith nado as our new king
orik crossed his arms
eragon could only see his face from the side but it was obvious that orik was scowling
biting the inside of his cheek eragon stared at the patterned floor counting the votes that had been cast as well as those that remained trying to determine if orik could still win the election
even in the best of circumstances it would be a close thing
eragon tightened his grip his fingernails digging into the back of his hands
thordris of durgrimst nagra stood and draped her long thick braid over one arm
on behalf of mine clan i vote for grimstborith orik as our new king
that makes three to three eragon said in a low voice
orik nodded
it was nado is turn to speak then
smoothing his beard with the flat of a hand the chief of durgrimst knurlcarathn smiled at the assembly a predatory gleam in his eyes
one behalf of mine clan i vote for myself as our new king
if you will have me i promise to rid our country of the outlanders who have polluted it and i promise to devote our gold and warriors to protecting our own people and not the necks of elves humans and urgals
