an hour later they emerged in odred valley which ran north to south
nestled among the foothills at the head of the narrow fern filled valley was fernoth merna a fair sized lake that was like a drop of dark ink between the towering mountains of the beor range
from the northern end of fernoth merna flowed the ragni darmn which wound its way up the valley until it joined with the az ragni by the flanks of moldun the proud the northernmost mountain of the beors
they had departed tronjheim well before dawn and although the tunnel had slowed them it was still early morning
the ragged strip of sky overhead was barred with rays of pale yellow where sunlight streamed between the peaks of the towering mountains
within the valley below ridges of heavy clouds clung to the sides of the mountains like vast gray snakes
coils of white mist drifted up from the glassy surface of the lake
eragon and saphira stopped at the edge of fernoth merna to drink and to replenish their waterskins for the next leg of their journey
the water came from melted snow and ice high in the mountains
it was so cold it made eragon is teeth hurt
he screwed up his eyes and stamped the ground groaning as a spike of cold induced pain shot through his skull
as the throbbing subsided he gazed across the lake
between the curtains of shifting mist he spotted the ruins of a sprawling castle built upon a bare stone spur on one mountain
thick ropes of ivy strangled the crumbling walls but aside from that the structure appeared lifeless
eragon shivered
the abandoned building seemed gloomy ominous as if it were the decaying carcass of some foul beast
ready he said and climbed into the saddle
saphira flew at as lofty an altitude as eragon could endure because it was easier for her to traverse long distances in the rarefied upper atmosphere than in the thick moist air near the ground
eragon protected himself against the freezing temperatures by wearing several layers of clothes and by shielding himself from the wind with a spell that split the stream of freezing air so it flowed harmlessly to either side
riding saphira was far from restful but since she flapped in a slow and steady rhythm eragon did not have to concentrate upon maintaining his balance as he did when she turned or dove or engaged in other more elaborate maneuvers
for the most part he divided his time between talking with saphira thinking back upon the events of the past few weeks and studying the ever changing vista below them
you used magic without the ancient language when the dwarves attacked you said saphira
that was a dangerous thing to do
i know but i did not have time to think of the words
besides you never use the ancient language when you cast a spell
that is different
i am a dragon
we do not need the ancient language to state our intentions we know what we want and we do not change our minds as easily as elves or humans
saphira flew until the sun had set and the stars covered the sky and the mountains were a dark purple smudge behind them
she would have continued on until morning but eragon insisted they stop to rest
you are still tired from your trip to farthen dur
we can fly through the night tomorrow and the day after as well if necessary but tonight you must sleep
although saphira did not like his proposal she agreed to it and landed by a patch of willow trees growing alongside a stream
as he dismounted eragon discovered his legs were so stiff he had difficulty remaining on his feet
he unsaddled saphira then spread his bedroll on the ground next to her and curled up with his back against her warm body
he had no need of a tent for she sheltered him with a wing like a mother hawk protecting her brood
the two of them soon sank into their respective dreams which mingled in strange and wonderful ways for their minds remained linked even then
a fierce headwind sprang up in midmorning which slowed saphira to half her normal speed
try as she might she could not rise above the wind
all day she fought against the rushing air
it was arduous work and although eragon gave her as much of his strength as he dared by afternoon her exhaustion was profound
