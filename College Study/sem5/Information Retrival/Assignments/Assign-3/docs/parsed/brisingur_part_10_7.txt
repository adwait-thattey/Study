blast ** exclaimed king orrin
eragon could not have picked a worse time to set off on his own
what matters a single ra zac when galbatorix is entire army resides but a few miles from us
we have to get him back
angela laughed
she was knitting a sock using five bone needles which clicked and clacked and scraped against each other with a steady if peculiar rhythm
how he will be traveling during the day and saphira dare not fly around searching for him when the sun is up and anyone might spot her and alert galbatorix
yes but he is our ** we cannot sit by idly while he remains in the midst of our enemies
i agree said narheim
however it is done we must ensure his safe return
grimstnzborith hrothgar adopted eragon into his family and clan that is mine own clan as you know and we owe him the loyalty of our law and our blood
arya knelt and to nasuada is surprise began to unlace and retie the upright sections of her boots
holding one of the cords between her teeth arya said saphira where exactly was eragon when you last touched his mind
and have you any idea what path he intended to follow
he did not yet know himself
springing to her feet arya said then i shall have to look everywhere i can
like a deer she bounded forward and ran across the clearing vanishing among the tents beyond as she sped northward as fast and light as the wind itself
arya ** shouted nasuada but the elf was already gone
hopelessness threatened to engulf nasuada as she stared after her
the center is crumbling she thought
grasping the edges of the mismatched pieces of armor that covered his torso as if to tear them off garzhvog said to nasuada do you want me to follow lady nightstalker i cannot run as fast as little elves but i can run as long
no
no stay
arya can pass for human at a distance but soldiers would hunt you down the moment some farmer caught sight of you
i am used to being hunted
but not in the middle of the empire with hundreds of galbatorix is men wandering the countryside
no arya will have to fend for herself
i pray that she can find eragon and keep him safe for without him we are doomed
