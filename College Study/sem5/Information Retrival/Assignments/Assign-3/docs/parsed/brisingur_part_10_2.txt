she struggled to ignore it as she responded you are stronger
i did not have to suffer through fadawar is pain as well
thank you for staying with me
i know what it must have cost you and i am grateful
grateful ** there is an empty word for me lady ** elva is small lips twisted in a misshapen smile
have you anything to eat i am famished
farica left some bread and wine behind those scrolls said nasuada pointing across the pavilion
she watched the girl make her way to the food and begin wolfing down the bread cramming large chunks into her mouth
at least you wo not have to live like this for much longer
as soon as eragon returns he will remove the spell
** after she had devoured half a loaf elva paused
i lied about the trial of the long knives
i foresaw that you would lose not win
if i had allowed events to take their course your nerve would have broken on the seventh cut and fadawar would be sitting where you are now
so i told you what you needed to hear in order to prevail
a chill crept over nasuada
if what elva said was true then she was in the witch child is debt more than ever
still she disliked being manipulated even if it was for her own benefit
i see
it seems i must thank you once again
elva laughed then a brittle sound
and you hate every moment of it do not you no matter
you need not worry about offending me nasuada
we are useful to each other no more
nasuada was relieved when one of the dwarves guarding the pavilion the captain of that particular watch banged his hammer against his shield and proclaimed the herbalist angela requests an audience with you lady nightstalker
granted said nasuada raising her voice
angela bustled into the pavilion carrying several bags and baskets looped over her arms
as always her curly hair formed a stormy cloud around her face which was pinched with concern
at her heels padded the werecat solembum in his animal form
he immediately angled toward elva and began to rub against her legs arching his back as he did
depositing her luggage on the ground angela rolled her shoulders and said ** between you and eragon i seem to spend most of my time among the varden healing people too silly to realize they need to avoid getting chopped into tiny little ** while she spoke the short herbalist marched over to nasuada and began unwinding the bandages around her right forearm
she clucked with disapproval
normally this is when the healer asks her patient how she is and the patient lies through her teeth and says oh not too bad and the healer says good good
be cheery and you will make a fine ** i think it is obvious however you re not about to start running around and leading charges against the empire
far from it
i will recover wo not i asked nasuada
you would if i could use magic to seal up these wounds
since i can not it is a bit harder to tell
you will have to muddle along like most people do and hope none of these cuts get ** she paused in her work and gazed directly at nasuada
you do realize these will scar
it will be what it will be
nasuada stifled a groan and gazed upward as angela stitched each of her wounds and then covered them with a thick wet mat of pulped plants
out of the corner of her eye she saw solembum jump onto the table and sit next to elva
extending a large shaggy paw the werecat hooked a piece of bread off elva is plate and nibbled on the morsel his white fangs flashing
the black tassels on his oversized ears quivered as he swiveled his ears from side to side listening to metal clad warriors walking past the red pavilion
barzul muttered angela
only men would think of cutting themselves to determine who the pack leader is
**
it hurt to laugh but nasuada could not help herself
indeed she said after her fit subsided
just as angela finished retying the last strip of cloth around nasuada is arms the dwarf captain outside the pavilion shouted ** and there came a chorus of shimmering bell like notes as the human guards crossed their swords barring the way to whoever sought entrance
without pausing to think nasuada drew the four inch knife from the sheath sewn within the bodice of her chemise
