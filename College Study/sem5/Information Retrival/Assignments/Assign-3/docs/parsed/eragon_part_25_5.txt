the problem is that she comes from a wealthy family her father has invested heavily in my business
if i keep suffering these losses there wo not be enough money for her to live the way she is used to
jeod continued but please my troubles are not your troubles
a host should never bother his guests with his own concerns
while you are in my house i will let nothing more than an over full stomach disturb you
thank you said brom
we appreciate the hospitality
our travels have long been without comforts of any kind
do you happen to know where we could find an inexpensive shop all this riding has worn out our clothes
of course
that is my job said jeod lightening up
he talked eagerly about prices and stores until his house was in sight
then he asked would you mind if we went somewhere else to eat it might be awkward if you came in right now
whatever makes you feel comfortable said brom
jeod looked relieved
thanks
let is leave your horses in my stable
they did as he suggested then followed him to a large tavern
unlike the green chestnut this one was loud clean and full of boisterous people
when the main course arrived a stuffed suckling pig eragon eagerly dug into the meat but he especially savored the potatoes carrots turnips and sweet apples that accompanied it
it had been a long time since he had eaten much more than wild game
they lingered over the meal for hours as brom and jeod swapped stories
eragon did not mind
he was warm a lively tune jangled in the background and there was more than enough food
the spirited tavern babble fell pleasantly on his ears
when they finally exited the tavern the sun was nearing the horizon
you two go ahead i have to check on something eragon said
he wanted to see saphira and make sure that she was safely hidden
brom agreed absently
be careful
do not take too long
wait said jeod
are you going outside teirm eragon hesitated then reluctantly nodded
make sure you re inside the walls before dark
the gates close then and the guards wo not let you back in until morning
i wo not be late promised eragon
he turned around and loped down a side street toward teirm is outer wall
once out of the city he breathed deeply enjoying the fresh ** he ** are you she guided him off the road to the base of a mossy cliff surrounded by maples
he saw her head poke out of the trees on the top and ** am i supposed to get up there
if you find a clearing i will come down and get you
no he said eyeing the cliff that wo not be ** will just climb up
and you worry too much
let me have some fun
eragon pulled off his gloves and started climbing
he relished the physical challenge
there were plenty of handholds so the ascent was easy
he was soon high above the trees
halfway up he stopped on a ledge to catch his breath
once his strength returned he stretched up for the next handhold but his arm was not long enough
stymied he searched for another crevice or ridge to grasp
there was none
he tried backing down but his legs could not reach his last foothold
saphira watched with unblinking eyes
he gave up and said i could use some help
** i know
are you going to get me down or not
if i were not around you would be in a very bad situation
eragon rolled his ** do not have to tell me
you re right
after all how can a mere dragon expect to tell a man like yourself what to do in fact everyone should stand in awe of your brilliance of finding the only dead end
why if you had started a few feet in either direction the path to the top would have been ** cocked her head at him eyes bright
all ** i made a mistake
now can you please get me out of here he pleaded
she pulled her head back from the edge of the cliff
after a moment he called saphira above him were only swaying trees
** come ** he roared
with a loud crash saphira barreled off the top of the cliff flipping around in midair
she floated down to eragon like a huge bat and grabbed his shirt with her claws scratching his back
he let go of the rocks as she yanked him up in the air
after a brief flight she set him down gently on the top of the cliff and tugged her claws out of his shirt
