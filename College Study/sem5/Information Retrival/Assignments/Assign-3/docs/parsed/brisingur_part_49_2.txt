there is much i still hope to accomplish but none of it is for myself only for you and you shall eclipse everything i have done
of that i am sure
before my grave closes over me though i wanted to be able at least this once to call you my son
my son
your whole life eragon i have longed to reveal to you who i was
it has been a pleasure like no other for me to watch you growing up but also a torture like no other because of the secret i held in my heart
brom laughed then a harsh barking sound
well i did not exactly manage to keep you safe from the empire now did i if you are still wondering who was responsible for garrow is death you need look no further for here he sits
it was my own foolishness
i should never have returned to carvahall
and now look garrow dead and you a dragon rider
i warn you eragon beware of whom you fall in love with for fate seems to have a morbid interest in our family
wrapping his lips around the stem of his pipe brom drew on the smoldering cardus weed several times blowing the chalk white smoke off to one side
the pungent smell was heavy in saphira is nostrils
brom said i have my share of regrets but you are not one of them eragon
you may occasionally behave like a moon addled fool such as letting these blasted urgals escape but you are no more of an idiot than i was at your ** he nodded
less of an idiot in fact
i am proud to have you as my son eragon prouder than you will ever know
i never thought that you would become a rider as i was nor wished that future upon you but seeing you with saphira ah it makes me feel like crowing at the sun like a rooster
brom drew on the pipe again
i realize you may be angry at me for keeping this from you
i can not say i would have been happy to discover the name of my own father this way
whether you like it or not though we are family you and i
since i could not give you the care i owed you as your father i will give you the one thing i can instead and that is advice
hate me if you wish eragon but heed what i have to say for i know whereof i speak
with his free hand brom grasped the sheath of his sword the veins prominent on the back of his hand
he fixed the pipe in one corner of his mouth
right
now my advice is twofold
whatever you do protect those you care for
without them life is more miserable than you can imagine
an obvious statement i know but no less true because of it
there that is the first part of my advice
as for the rest
if you are so fortunate as to have already killed galbatorix or if anyone has succeeded in slitting that traitor is throat then congratulations
if not then you must realize that galbatorix is your greatest and most dangerous enemy
until he is dead neither you nor saphira will ever find peace
you may run to the farthest corners of the earth but unless you join the empire one day you will have to confront galbatorix
i am sorry eragon but that is the truth of it
i have fought many magicians and several of the forsworn and so far i have always defeated my ** the lines on brom is forehead deepened
well all but once but that was because i was not yet fully grown
anyway the reason i have always emerged triumphant is that i use my brain unlike most
i am not a strong spellcaster nor are you compared with galbatorix but when it comes to a wizards duel intelligence is even more important than strength
the way to defeat another magician is not by battering blindly against his mind
** in order to ensure victory you have to figure out how your enemy interprets information and reacts to the world
then you will know his weaknesses and there you strike
the trick is not inventing a spell no one else has ever thought of before the trick is finding a spell your enemy has overlooked and using it against him
the trick is not plowing your way through the barriers in someone is mind the trick is slipping underneath or around the barriers
no one is omniscient eragon
re member that
galbatorix may have immense power but he cannot anticipate every possibility
whatever you do you must remain nimble in your thinking
do not become so attached to any one belief that you cannot see past it to another possibility
