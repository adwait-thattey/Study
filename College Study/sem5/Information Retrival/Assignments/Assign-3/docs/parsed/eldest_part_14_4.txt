all that was forgotten now as he hurried to the threshold eager to see their destination
he found himself standing on a granite outcropping more than a hundred feet above a purple hued lake brilliant under the eastern sun
like kostha merna the water reached from mountain to mountain filling the valley is end
from the lake is far side the az ragni flowed north winding between the peaks until in the far distance it rushed out onto the eastern plains
to his right the mountains were bare save for a few trails but to his left
to his left was the dwarf city tarnag
here the dwarves had reworked the seemingly immutable beors into a series of terraces
the lower terraces were mainly farms dark curves of land waiting to be planted dotted with squat halls which as best he could tell were built entirely of stone
above those empty levels rose tier upon tier of interlocking buildings until they culminated in a giant dome of gold and white
it was as if the entire city was nothing more than a line of steps leading to the dome
the cupola glistened like polished moonstone a milky bead floating atop a pyramid of gray slate
orik anticipated eragon is question saying that is celbedeil the greatest temple of dwarfdom and home of durgrimst quan the quan clan who act as servants and messengers to the gods
do they rule tarnag asked saphira
eragon repeated the query
nay said arya stepping past them
though the quan are strong they are small in numbers despite their power over the afterlife
and gold
it is the ragni hefthyn the river guard who control tarnag
we will stay with their clan chief undin while here
as they followed the elf off the outcropping and through the gnarled forest that blanketed the mountain orik whispered to eragon mind her not
she has been arguing with the quan for many a year
every time she visits tarnag and speaks with a priest it produces a quarrel fierce enough to scare a kull
orik nodded grimly
i know little of it but i ve heard she disagrees strongly with much that the quan practice
it seems that elves do not hold with amuttering into the air for **
eragon stared at arya is back as they descended wondering if orik is words were true and if so what arya herself believed
he took a deep breath pushing the matter from his mind
it felt wonderful to be back in the open where he could smell the moss and ferns and trees of the forest where the sun was warm on his face and bees and other insects swarmed pleasantly
the path took them down to the edge of the lake before rising back toward tarnag and its open gates
how have you hidden tarnag from galbatorix asked eragon
farthen dur i understand but this
i ve never seen anything like it
orik laughed softly
hide it that would be impossible
no after the riders fell we were forced to abandon all our cities aboveground and retreat into our tunnels in order to escape galbatorix and the forsworn
they would often fly through the beors killing anyone who they encountered
i thought that dwarves always lived underground
orik is thick eyebrows met in a frown
why should we we may have an affinity for stone but we like the open air as much as elves or humans
however it has only been in the last decade and a half ever since morzan died that we have dared return to tarnag and other of our ancient dwellings
galbatorix may be unnaturally powerful but even he would not attack an entire city alone
of course he and his dragon could cause us no end of trouble if they wanted but these days they rarely leave uru baen even for short trips
nor could galbatorix bring an army here without first defeating buragh or farthen dur
cresting a small mound eragon jolted with surprise as an animal crashed through the underbrush and onto the path
the scraggly creature looked like a mountain goat from the spine except that it was a third larger and had giant ribbed horns that curled around its cheeks making an urgal is seem no bigger than a swallow nest
odder still was the saddle lashed across the goat is back and the dwarf seated firmly on it aiming a half drawn bow into the air
