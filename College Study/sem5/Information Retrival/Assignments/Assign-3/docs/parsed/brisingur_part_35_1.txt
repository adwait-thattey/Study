roran katrina asked in a sleep smeared voice
she propped herself up on one arm and reached for him with the other
he did not react as she touched him sliding her hand across his upper back and rubbing his neck
sleep
you need your rest
you will be gone again before long
he shook his head not looking at her
what is it she asked
sitting upright she pulled a blanket over his shoulders then leaned against him her cheek warm against his arm
are you worried about your new captain or where nasuada may send you next
she was silent for a while
every time you leave i feel as if less of you returns to me
you have become so grim and quiet
if you want to tell me about what is troubling you you can you know no matter how terrible it is
i am the daughter of a butcher and i have seen my share of men fall in battle
** roran exclaimed choking on the word
i do not ever want to think about it ** he clenched his fists his breathing uncertain
a true warrior would not feel as i do
a true warrior she said does not fight because he wishes to but because he has to
a man who yearns for war a man who enjoys his killing he is a brute and a monster
no matter how much glory he wins on the battlefield that cannot erase the fact that he is no better than a rabid wolf who will turn on his friends and family as soon as his ** she brushed his hair away from his brow and stroked the top of his head light and slow
you once told me that the song of gerand was your favorite of brom is stories that it was why you fight with a hammer instead of a blade
remember how gerand disliked killing and how reluctant he was to take up arms again
and yet he was considered the greatest warrior of his ** she cupped his cheek in her hand and turned his face toward her so that he was forced to gaze into her solemn eyes
and you are the greatest warrior i know of roran here or anywhere
with a dry mouth he said what of eragon or
they are not half so valorous as you
eragon murtagh galbatorix the elves
all of them march into battle with spells upon their lips and might that far exceeds ours
but you she kissed him on the nose you are no more than a man
you face your foes on your own two feet
you are not a magician and yet you slew the twins
you are only as fast and as strong as a human may be and yet you did not shirk from attacking the ra zac in their lair and freeing me from their dungeon
he swallowed
i had wards from eragon to protect me
but no longer
besides you did not have any wards in carvahall either and did you flee from the ra zac then when he was unresponsive she said you are no more than a man but you have done things not even eragon or murtagh could have
to me that makes you the greatest warrior in alagaesia
i cannot think of anyone else in carvahall who would have gone to the lengths you did to rescue me
your father would have he said
he felt her shiver against him
yes he would have she whispered
but he never would have been able to convince others to follow him as you ** she tightened her arm around him
what ever you have seen or done you will always have me
that is all i will ever need he said and clasped her in his arms and held her for a span
then he sighed
still i wish this war were at an end
i wish i could till a field again and sow my crops and harvest them when they ripened
farming is backbreaking work but at least it is honest labor
this killing is not honest
it is thievery
the thievery of men is lives and no right minded person should aspire to it
as you ** difficult as it was he made himself smile
i have forgotten myself
here i am burdening you with my troubles when you have worries enough of your ** and he placed a hand over her rounding womb
your troubles shall always be my troubles so long as we are married she murmured and nuzzled his arm
some troubles he said no one else should have to endure especially not those you love
she withdrew an inch or two from him and he saw her eyes become bleak and listless as they did whenever she fell to brooding over the time she had spent imprisoned in helgrind
no she whispered some troubles no one else should have to endure
