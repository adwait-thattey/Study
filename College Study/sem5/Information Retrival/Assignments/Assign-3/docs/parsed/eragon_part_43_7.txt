solembum padded down the hall flipping his tail
he tried to catch up with solembum but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned passageways
then as eragon rounded a corner he saw the werecat stop before a door and yowl
seemingly of its own accord the door slid inward
solembum slipped inside then the door shut
eragon halted in front of it perplexed
he raised his hand to knock but before he did the door opened once more and warm light spilled out
after a moment is indecision he stepped inside
he entered an earthy two room suite lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants
the air was warm fresh and humid
bright lanterns hung on the walls and from the low ceiling
piles of intriguing items cluttered the floor obscuring the corners
a large four poster bed curtained by even more plants was in the far room
in the center of the main room on a plush leather chair sat the fortuneteller and witch angela
she smiled brightly
what are you doing here blurted eragon
angela folded her hands in her lap
well why do not you sit on the floor and i will tell you i d offer you a chair but i am sitting on the only ** questions buzzed through eragon is mind as he settled between two flasks of acrid bubbling green potions
** exclaimed angela leaning forward
youare a rider
i suspected as much but i did not know for certain until yesterday
i am sure solembum knew but he never told me
i should have figured it out the moment you mentioned brom
saphira
i like the name fitting for a dragon
brom is dead said eragon abruptly
the ra zac killed him
angela was taken aback
she twirled a lock of her dense curls
i am sorry
i truly am she said softly
eragon smiled bitterly
but not surprised are you you foretold his death after all
i did not know whose death it would be she said shaking her head
but no
i am not surprised
i met brom once or twice
he did not care for my frivolous attitude toward magic
it irritated him
eragon frowned
in teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke
why
angela is face tightened momentarily
in retrospect it was in rather bad taste but i did not know what would befall him
how do i put this
brom was cursed in a way
it was his wyrd to fail at all of his tasks except one although through no fault of his own
he was chosen as a rider but his dragon was killed
he loved a woman but it was his affection that was her undoing
and he was chosen i assume to guard and train you but in the end he failed at that as well
the only thing he succeeded at was killing morzan and a better deed he could not have done
brom never mentioned a woman to me retorted eragon
angela shrugged carelessly
i heard it from one who could not have lied
but enough of this ** life goes on and we should not trouble the dead with our ** she scooped a pile of reeds from the floor and deftly started plaiting them together closing the subject to discussion
eragon hesitated then gave in
all right
so why are you in tronjheim instead of teirm
ah at last an interesting question said angela
after hearing brom is name again during your visit i sensed a return of the past in alagaesia
people were whispering that the empire was hunting a rider
i knew then that the varden is dragon egg must have hatched so i closed my shop and set out to learn more
of course i did
i am not an idiot
i ve been around much longer than you would believe
very little happens that i do not know ** she paused and concentrated on her weaving
anyway i knew i had to get to the varden as fast as possible
i ve been here for nearly a month now though i really do not care for this place it is far too musty for my taste
and everyone in farthen dur isso serious and noble
they re probably all doomed to tragic deaths ** she gave a long sigh a mocking expression on her face
and the dwarves are just a superstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their lives
the only redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow inside farthen dur
then why stay asked eragon smiling
because i like to be wherever important events are occurring said angela cocking her head
