just as roran drew his bow in an attempt to begin and end the battle with a well placed shaft he was distracted by a commotion in the forest
a mass of deer burst through the underbrush and stampeded across the meadow ignoring villagers and livestock alike in their frantic desire to escape the ra zac
for almost a minute the deer bounded past roran mincing the loam with their sharp hooves and catching the moonlight with their white rimmed eyes
they came so close he heard the soft gasps of their labored breathing
the multitude of deer must have hidden the villagers because after one last circuit over the meadow the winged monster turned to the south and glided farther down the spine melding into the night
roran and his companions remained frozen in place like hunted rabbits afraid that the ra zac is departure might be a ruse to flush them into the open or that the creature is twin might be close behind
they waited for hours tense and anxious barely moving except to string a bow
when the moon was about to set the ra zac is bone chilling shriek echoed far in the distance
then nothing
we were lucky decided roran when he woke the next ** we can not count on luck to save us the next time
after the ra zac is appearance none of the villagers objected to traveling by barge
on the contrary they were so eager to be off many of them asked roran if it was possible to set sail that day instead of the next
i wish we could he said but too much has to be done
forgoing breakfast he horst and a group of other men hiked into narda
roran knew that he risked being recognized by accompanying them but their mission was too important for him to neglect
besides he was confident that his current appearance was different enough from his portrait on the empire is poster that no one would equate one with the other
they had no difficulty gaining entrance as a different set of soldiers guarded the town gate whereupon they went to the docks and delivered the two hundred crowns to clovis who was busy overseeing a gang of men as they readied the barges for sea
thank ee stronghammer he said tying the bag of coins to his belt
there be nothing like yellow gold to brighten a man is ** he led them to a worktable and unrolled a chart of the waters surrounding narda complete with notations on the strength of various currents locations of rocks sandbars and other hazards and decades worth of sounding measurements
drawing a line with his finger from narda to a small cove directly south of it clovis said here is where we will meet your livestock
the tides are gentle this time o year but we still do not want to fight them an no bones about it so we will have to be on our way directly after the high tide
high tide said roran
would not it be easier to wait until low tide and let it carry us out
clovis tapped his nose with a twinkle in his eye
aye it would an so i ve begun many a cruise
what i do not want though is to be slung up on the beach loading your animals when the tide comes a rushing back in and pushes us farther inland
there be no danger of that this way but we will have to move smart so as we re not left high an dry when the waters recede
assuming we do the sea will work for us eh
roran nodded
he trusted clovis is experience
and how many men will you need to fill out your crews
well i managed to dig up seven lads strong true an good seamen all who have agreed to this venture odd as it is
mind you most of the boys were at the bottom of their tankards when i cornered them last night drinking off the pay from their last voyage but they will be sober as spinsters come morn that i promise you
seeing as seven were all i could find i d like four more
four it is said roran
my men do not know much about sailing but they re able bodied and willing to learn
clovis grunted
i usually take on a brace of new lads each trip anyway
so long as they follow orders they will do fine otherwise they will get a belaying pin upsides the head mark my words
as for guards i d like to have nine three per boat
an they d better not be as green as your sailors or i wo not budge from the dock not for all the whisky in the world
