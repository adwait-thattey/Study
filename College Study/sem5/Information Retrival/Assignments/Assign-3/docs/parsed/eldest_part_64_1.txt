the first horizontal rays of dawn already streaked across the land when trianna said to eragon it is time
a surge of energy erased eragon is sleepiness
jumping to his feet he shouted the word to everyone around him even as he clambered into saphira is saddle pulling his new bow from its quiver
the kull and dwarves surrounded saphira and together they hurried down the breastwork until they reached the opening that had been cleared during the night
the varden poured through the gap quiet as they could be
rank upon rank of warriors marched past their armor and weapons padded with rags so no sound would alert the empire of their approach
saphira joined the procession when nasuada appeared on a roan charger in the midst of the men arya and trianna by her side
the five of them acknowledged each other with quick glances nothing more
during the night the mephitic vapors had accumulated low to the ground and now the dim morning light gilded the turgid clouds turning them opaque
thus the varden managed to cross three quarters of the no man is land before they were seen by the empire is sentries
as the alarm horns rang out before them nasuada shouted now ** tell orrin to strike
to me men of the ** fight to win back your homes
fight to guard your wives and ** fight to overthrow ** attack and bathe your blades in the blood of our ** ** she spurred her horse forward and with a great bellow the men followed shaking their weapons above their heads
eragon conveyed nasuada is order to barden the spellcaster who rode with king orrin
a moment later he heard the drumming of hooves as orrin and his cavalry accompanied by the rest of the kull who could run as fast as horses galloped out of the east
they charged into the empire is flank pinning the soldiers against the jiet river and distracting them long enough for the varden to cross the remainder of the distance between them without opposition
the two armies collided with a deafening roar
pikes clashed against spears hammers against shields swords against helms and above it all whirled the hungry gore crows uttering their harsh croaks driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh meat below
eragon is heart leaped within his ** must now kill or be killed
almost immediately he felt his wards drawing upon his strength as they deflected attacks from arya orik nasuada and saphira
saphira held back from the leading edge of the battle for they would be too exposed to galbatorix is magicians at the front
taking a deep breath eragon began to search for those magicians with his mind firing arrows all the while
du vrangr gata found the first enemy spellcaster
the instant he was alerted eragon reached out to the woman who made the discovery and from there to the foe she grappled with
bringing the full power of his will to bear eragon demolished the magician is resistance took control of his consciousness doing his best to ignore the man is terror determined which troops the man was guarding and slew the man with one of the twelve words of death
without pause eragon located the minds of each of the now unprotected soldiers and killed them as well
the varden cheered as the knot of men went limp
the ease with which he slew them amazed eragon
the soldiers had had no chance to escape or fight ** different from farthen dur he thought
though he marveled at the perfection of his skills the deaths sickened him
but there was no time to dwell on it
recovering from the varden is initial assault the empire began to man their engines of war catapults that cast round missiles of hard baked ceramic trebuchets armed with barrels of liquid fire and ballistae that bombarded the attackers with a hail of arrows six feet long
the ceramic balls and the liquid fire caused terrific damage when they landed
one ball exploded against the ground not ten yards from saphira
as eragon ducked behind his shield a jagged fragment spun toward his head only to be stopped dead in the air by one of his wards
he blinked at the sudden loss of energy
the engines soon stalled the varden is advance sowing mayhem wherever they ** have to be destroyed if we re going to last long enough to wear down the empire realized eragon
