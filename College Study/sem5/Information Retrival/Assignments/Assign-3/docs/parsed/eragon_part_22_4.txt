i mean this as a warning do not try anything until you ve learned more
now enough of this for tonight
as they spread out their blankets saphira commented with satisfaction we are becoming more powerful eragon both of us
soon no one will be able to stand in our way
yes but which way shall we choose
whichever one we want she said smugly settling down for the night
why do you think those two urgals were still in yazuac asked eragon after they had been on the trail for a while
there does not seem to be any reason for them to have stayed behind
i suspect they deserted the main group to loot the town
what makes it odd is that as far as i know urgals have gathered in force only two or three times in history
it is unsettling that they are doing it now
do you think the ra zac caused the attack
i do not know
the best thing we can do is continue away from yazuac at the fastest pace we can muster
besides this is the direction the ra zac went south
eragon agreed
we still need provisions however
is there another town nearby
brom shook his head
no but saphira can hunt for us if we must survive on meat alone
this swath of trees may look small to you but there are plenty of animals in it
the river is the only source of water for many miles around so most of the plains animals come here to drink
we wo not starve
eragon remained quiet satisfied with brom is answer
as they rode loud birds darted around them and the river rushed by peacefully
it was a noisy place full of life and energy
eragon asked how did that urgal get you things were happening so fast i did not see
bad luck really grumbled brom
i was more than a match for him so he kicked snowfire
the idiot of a horse reared and threw me off balance
that was all the urgal needed to give me this ** he scratched his chin
i suppose you re still wondering about this magic
the fact that you ve discovered it presents a thorny problem
few know it but every rider could use magic though with differing strengths
they kept the ability secret even at the height of their power because it gave them an advantage over their enemies
had everyone known about it dealing with common people would have been difficult
many think the king is magical powers come from the fact that he is a wizard or sorcerer
that is not true it is because he is a rider
what is the difference does not the fact that i used magic make me a sorcerer
not at ** a sorcerer like a shade uses spirits to accomplish his will
that is totally different from your power
nor does that make you a magician whose powers come without the aid of spirits or a dragon
and you re certainly not a witch or wizard who get their powers from various potions and spells
which brings me back to my original point the problem you ve presented
young riders like yourself were put through a strict regimen designed to strengthen their bodies and increase their mental control
this regimen continued for many months occasionally years until the riders were deemed responsible enough to handle magic
up until then not one student was told of his potential powers
if one of them discovered magic by accident he or she was immediately taken away for private tutoring
it was rare for anyone to discover magic on his own he inclined his head toward eragon though they were never put under the same pressure you were
then how were they finally trained to use magic asked eragon
i do not see how you could teach it to anyone
if you had tried to explain it to me two days ago it would not have made any sense
the students were presented with a series of pointless exercises designed to frustrate them
for example they were instructed to move piles of stones using only their feet fill ever draining tubs full of water and other impossibilities
after a time they would get infuriated enough to use magic
most of the time it succeeded
what this means brom continued is that you will be disadvantaged if you ever meet an enemy who has received this training
there are still some alive who are that old the king for one not to mention the elves
any one of those could tear you apart with ease
