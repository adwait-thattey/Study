** then he held out his hands
i thought it would be a good idea since i will probably have to hit someone again
arya studied his knuckles
you are going to have difficulty wearing gloves
i can always cut them open to make room
she nodded and returned to gazing at the fire
eragon leaned back on his elbows and stretched out his legs content that he was prepared for whatever fights might await him in the immediate future
beyond that he dared not speculate for if he did he would begin to ask himself how he and saphira could possibly defeat murtagh or galbatorix and then panic would sink its icy claws into him
he fixed his gaze on the flickering depths of the fire
there in that writhing inferno he sought to forget his cares and responsibilities
but the constant motion of the flames soon lulled him into a passive state where unrelated fragments of thoughts sounds images and emotions drifted through him like snowflakes falling from a calm winter is sky
and amid that flurry there appeared the face of the soldier who had begged for his life
again eragon saw him crying and again he heard his desperate pleas and again he felt how his neck snapped like a wet branch of wood
tormented by the memories eragon clenched his teeth and breathed hard through flared nostrils
cold sweat sprang up over his entire body
he shifted in place and strove to dispel the soldier is unfriendly ghost but to no avail
go ** he shouted
it was not my fault
galbatorix is the one you should blame not me
i did not want to kill you
somewhere in the darkness surrounding them a wolf howled
from various locations across the plains a score of other wolves answered raising their voices in a discordant melody
the eerie singing made eragon is scalp tingle and goosebumps break out on his arms
then for a brief moment the howls coalesced into a single tone that was similar to the battle cry of a charging kull
what is wrong asked arya
is it the wolves they shall not bother us you know
they are teaching their pups how to hunt and they wo not allow their younglings near creatures who smell as strangely as we do
it is not the wolves out there said eragon hugging himself
it is the wolves in ** he tapped the middle of his forehead
arya nodded a sharp birdlike motion that betrayed the fact she was not human even though she had assumed the shape of one
it is always thus
the monsters of the mind are far worse than those that actually exist
fear doubt and hate have hamstrung more people than beasts ever have
and love she admitted
also greed and jealousy and every other obsessive urge the sentient races are susceptible to
eragon thought of tenga alone in the ruined elf outpost of edur ithindra hunched over his precious hoard of tomes searching always searching for his elusive ** he refrained from mentioning the hermit to arya for it was not in him to discuss that curious encounter at the present
instead he asked does it bother you when you kill
arya is green eyes narrowed
neither i nor the rest of my people eat the flesh of animals because we cannot bear to hurt another creature to satisfy our hunger and you have the effrontery to ask if killing disturbs us do you really understand so little of us that you believe we are coldhearted murderers
no of course not he protested
that is not what i meant
then say what you mean and do not give insult unless it is your intention
choosing his words with greater care now eragon said i asked this of roran before we attacked helgrind or a question very like it
what i want to know is how do you feel when you kill how are you supposed to feel he scowled at the fire
do you see the warriors you have vanquished staring back at you as real as you are before me
arya tightened her arms around her legs her gaze pensive
a flame jetted upward as the fire incinerated one of the moths circling the camp
ganga she murmured and motioned with a finger
with a flutter of downy wings the moths departed
never lifting her eyes from the clump of burning branches she said nine months after i became an ambassador my mother is only ambassador if truth be told i traveled from the varden in farthen dur to the capital of surda which was still a new country in those days
