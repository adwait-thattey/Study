to arya nasuada said i am impressed you found him
i was not sure you could
perhaps but i tend to believe your skill was as important as fortune is generosity
how long until you rejoin us
two three days unless we encounter unforeseen difficulties
good
i will expect you then
from now on i want you to contact me at least once before noon and once before nightfall
if i fail to hear from you i will assume you ve been captured and i will send saphira with a rescue force
we may not always have the privacy we need to work magic
find a way to get it
i need to know where you two are and whether you re safe
arya considered for a moment and then said if i can i will do as you ask but not if it puts eragon in danger
taking advantage of the ensuing pause in the conversation eragon said nasuada is saphira near at hand i would like to talk to her
we have not spoken since helgrind
she left an hour ago to scout our perimeter
can you maintain this spell while i find out if she has returned
a single step carried nasuada out of their field of view leaving behind a static image of the table and chairs inside her red pavilion
for a good while eragon appraised the contents of the tent but then restlessness overtook him and he allowed his eyes to drift from the pool of water to the back of arya is neck
her thick black hair fell to one side exposing a strip of smooth skin just above the collar of her dress
that transfixed him for the better part of a minute and then he stirred and leaned against the charred stump
there came the sound of breaking wood and then a field of sparkling blue scales covered the pool as saphira forced herself into the pavilion
it was hard for eragon to tell what part of her he saw it was such a small part
the scales slid past the pool and he glimpsed the underside of a thigh a spike on her tail the baggy membrane of a folded wing and then the gleaming tip of a tooth as she turned and twisted trying to find a position from which she could comfortably view the mirror nasuada used for arcane communications
from the alarming noises that originated behind saphira eragon guessed she was crushing most of the furniture
at last she settled in place brought her head close to the mirror so that one large sapphire eye occupied the entire pool and peered out at eragon
they looked at each other for a full minute neither of them moving
it surprised eragon how relieved he was to see her
he had not truly felt safe since he and she had separated
the muffled answer floated toward him from somewhere to the right of saphira yes barely
would you be so kind as to relay saphira is comments to me
i am more than happy to but at the moment i am caught between a wing and a pole and there is no path free so far as i can tell
you may have difficulty hearing me
if you re willing to bear with me though i will give it a try
nasuada was quiet for several heartbeats and then in a tone so like saphira is that eragon almost laughed she said you are well
i am healthy as an ox
and you
to compare myself with a bovine would be both ridiculous and insulting but i am as fit as ever if that is what you are asking
i am pleased arya is with you
it is good for you to have someone sensible around to watch your back
i agree
help is always welcome when you re in ** while eragon was grateful that he and saphira were able to talk albeit in a roundabout fashion he found the spoken word a poor substitute for the free exchange of thoughts and emotions they enjoyed when in close proximity
furthermore with arya and nasuada privy to their conversation eragon was reluctant to address topics of a more personal nature such as whether saphira had forgiven him for forcing her to leave him in helgrind
saphira must have shared in his reluctance for she too refrained from broaching the subject
they chatted about other inconsequential happenings and then bade each other farewell
before he stepped away from the pool eragon touched his fingers to his lips and silently mouthed i am sorry
a sliver of space appeared around each of the small scales that rimmed saphira is eye as the underlying flesh softened
