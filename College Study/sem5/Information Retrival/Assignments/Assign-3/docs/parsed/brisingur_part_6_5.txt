from his place on her saddle roran said eragon come ** do not be daft
you re too important to risk
a combination of noise and motion obscured the rest of his sentence as saphira launched herself out of the cave
in the clear sky beyond her scales sparkled like a multitude of brilliant blue diamonds
she was eragon thought magnificent proud noble and more beautiful than any other living creature
no stag or lion could compete with the majesty of a dragon in flight
she said a week that is how long i shall wait
then i shall return for you eragon even if i must fight my way past thorn shruikan and a thousand magicians
eragon stood there until she dwindled from sight and he could no longer touch her mind
then his heart heavy as lead he squared his shoulders and turned away from the sun and all things bright and living and once more descended into the tunnels of shadow
