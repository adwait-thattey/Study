why can not you or i heal that with magic asked eragon
brom blinked
no reason i just never considered it because it is beyond my strength
you could probably do it with the right word but i do not want you to exhaust yourself
i could save you a lot of trouble and pain protested eragon
i will live with it said brom flatly
using magic to heal a wound takes just as much energy as it would to mend on its own
i do not want you tired for the next few days
you should not attempt such a difficult task yet
still if it is possible to fix your arm could i bring someone back from the dead
the question surprised brom but he answered quickly remember what i said about projects that will kill you that is one of them
riders were forbidden to try to resurrect the dead for their own safety
there is an abyss beyond life where magic means nothing
if you reach into it your strength will flee and your soul will fade into darkness
wizards sorcerers and riders all have failed and died on that threshold
stick with what is possible cuts bruises maybe some broken bones but definitely not dead people
eragon frowned
this is a lot more complex than i thought
** said brom
and if you do not understand what you re doing you will try something too big and ** he twisted in his saddle and swooped down grabbing a handful of pebbles from the ground
with effort he righted himself then discarded all but one of the rocks
see this pebble
take ** eragon did and stared at the unremarkable lump
it was dull black smooth and as large as the end of his thumb
there were countless stones like it on the trail
this is your training
eragon looked back at him confused
i do not understand
of course you do not said brom impatiently
that is why i am teaching you and not the other way around
now stop talking or we will never get anywhere
what i want you to do is lift the rock off your palm and hold it in the air for as long as you can
the words you re going to use arestenr reisa
say them
eragon focused sourly on the pebble searching his mind for any hint of the energy that had burned in him the day before
the stone remained motionless as he stared at it sweating and ** am i supposed to do this finally he crossed his arms and snapped this is impossible
no said brom gruffly
i willsay when it is impossible or not
fight for ** do not give in this easily
try again
frowning eragon closed his eyes setting aside all distracting thoughts
he took a deep breath and reached into the farthest corners of his consciousness trying to find where his power resided
searching he found only thoughts and memories until he felt something different a small bump that was a part of him and yet not of him
excited he dug into it seeking what it hid
he felt resistance a barrier in his mind but knew that the power lay on the other side
he tried to breach it but it held firm before his efforts
growing angry eragon drove into the barrier ramming against it with all of his might until it shattered like a thin pane of glass flooding his mind with a river of light
stenr reisa he gasped
the pebble wobbled into the air over his faintly glowing palm
he struggled to keep it floating but the power slipped away and faded back behind the barrier
the pebble dropped to his hand with a soft plop and his palm returned to normal
he felt a little tired but grinned from his success
not bad for your first time said brom
why does my hand do that it is like a little lantern
no one is sure brom admitted
the riders always preferred to channel their power through whichever hand bore the gedwey ignasia
you can use your other palm but it is not as ** he looked at eragon for a minute
i will buy you some gloves at the next town if it is not gutted
you hide the mark pretty well on your own but we do not want anyone to see it by accident
besides there may be times when you wo not want the glow to alert an enemy
do you have a mark of your own
no
only riders have them said brom
also you should know that magic is affected by distance just like an arrow or a spear
if you try to lift or move something a mile away it will take more energy than if you were closer
