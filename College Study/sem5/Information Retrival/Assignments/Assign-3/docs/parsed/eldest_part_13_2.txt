when nothing else of interest occurred roran untied his bedroll and slipped under the blankets
throughout the next day carvahall was consumed with unusual activity
figures strode between houses and even roran was surprised to see rode out into palancar valley toward various farms
at noon he saw two men enter the soldiers camp and disappear into the ra zac is tent for almost an hour
so involved was he with the proceedings roran barely moved the entire day
he was in the middle of dinner when as he had hoped baldor reappeared
hungry asked roran gesturing
baldor shook his head and sat with an air of exhaustion
dark lines under his eyes made his skin look thin and bruised
quimby is dead
roran is bowl clattered as it struck the ground
he cursed wiping cold stew off his leg then asked how
a couple of soldiers started bothering tara last ** tara was morn is wife
she did not really mind except the men got in a fight over who she was supposed to serve next
quimby was there checking a cask morn said had turned and he tried to break them ** roran nodded
that was quimby always interfering to make sure others behaved properly
only thing is a soldier threw a pitcher and hit him on the temple
killed him instantly
roran stared at the ground with his hands on his hips struggling to regain control over his ragged breathing
he felt as if baldor had knocked the wind out of ** does not seem possible
quimby gone the farmer and part time brewer was as much a part of the landscape as the mountains surrounding carvahall an unquestioned presence that shaped the fabric of the village
will the men be punished
baldor held up his hand
right after quimby died the ra zac stole his body from the tavern and hauled it out to their tents
we tried to get it back last night but they would not talk with us
baldor grunted rubbing his face
dad and loring met with the ra zac today and managed to convince them to release the body
the soldiers however wo not face any ** he paused
i was about to leave when quimby was handed over
you know what his wife got bones
every one of them was nibbled clean you could see the bite marks and most had been cracked open for the marrow
disgust gripped roran as well as profound horror for quimby is fate
it was well known that a person is spirit could never rest until his body was given a proper burial
revolted by the desecration he asked what who ate him then
the soldiers were just as appalled
it must have been the ra zac
i do not think said baldor that the ra zac are human
you ve never seen them up close but their breath is foul and they always cover their faces with black scarves
their backs are humped and twisted and they speak to each other with clicks
even their men seem to fear them
if they are not human then what kind of creatures can they be demanded roran
they re not urgals
fear now joined roran is revulsion fear of the supernatural
he saw it echoed on baldor is face as the young man clasped his hands
for all the stories of galbatorix is misdeeds it was still a shock to have the king is evil roosted among their homes
a sense of history settled on roran as he realized he was involved with forces he had previously been acquainted with only through songs and stories
something should be done he muttered
the air grew warmer through the night until by afternoon palancar valley shimmered and sweltered with the unexpected spring heat
carvahall looked peaceful under the bald blue sky yet roran could feel the sour resentment that clenched its inhabitants with malicious intensity
the calm was like a sheet stretched taut in the wind
despite the aura of expectation the day proved to be utterly boring roran spent most of his time brushing horst is mare
at last he lay to sleep looking up past the towering pines at the haze of stars that adorned the night sky
they seemed so close it felt as if he hurtled among them falling toward the blackest void
the moon was setting when roran woke his throat raw from smoke
he coughed and rolled upright blinking as his eyes burned and watered
the noxious fumes made it difficult to breathe
