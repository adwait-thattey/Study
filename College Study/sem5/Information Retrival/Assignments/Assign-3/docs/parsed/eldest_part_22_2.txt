eragon could hear the elves whispering and laughing all around though he could not see them
occasionally they would call directions when he or the dwarves blundered
ahead a fire glowed through the trees sending shadows racing like sprites across the leafy ground
as eragon entered the radius of light he saw three small huts clustered together around the base of a large oak
high in the tree was a roofed platform where a watchman could observe the river and forest
a pole had been lashed between two of the huts from it hung bundles of drying plants
the four elves vanished into the huts then returned with their arms piled high with fruits and vegetables but no meat and began preparing a meal for their guests
they hummed as they worked flitting from one tune to another as the fancy took them
when orik asked their names the dark haired elf pointed to himself and said i am lifaen of house rilvenar
and my companions are edurna celdin and nari
eragon sat beside saphira happy for an opportunity to rest and to watch the elves
though all four were male their faces resembled arya is with delicate lips thin noses and large slanted eyes that shone under their brows
the rest of their bodies matched with narrow shoulders and slender arms and legs
each was more fair and noble than any human eragon had seen albeit in a rarefied exotic manner
who ever thought i would get to visit the elves homeland eragon asked himself
he grinned and leaned against the corner of a hut drowsy with the fire is warmth
above him saphira is dancing blue eyes tracked the elves with unwavering precision
more magic is in this race she finally remarked than either humans or dwarves
they do not feel as if they come from the earth or the stone but rather from another realm half in half out like reflections seen through water
they certainly are graceful he said
the elves moved like dancers their every action smooth and lithe
brom had told eragon that it was rude for someone to speak with their mind to a rider is dragon without permission and the elves adhered to that custom voicing aloud their comments to saphira who would then answer the elves directly
saphira usually refrained from touching the thoughts of humans and dwarves and allowed eragon to relay her words since few members of those races had the training to guard their minds if they wished for privacy
it also seemed an imposition to use such an intimate form of contact for casual exchanges
the elves had no such inhibitions though they welcomed saphira into their minds reveling in her presence
at last the food was ready and served on carved plates that felt like dense bone although wood grain wandered through the flowers and vines decorating the rim
eragon was also supplied with a flagon of gooseberry wine made of the same unusual material with a sculpted dragon wrapped around its stem
as they ate lifaen produced a set of reed pipes and began to play a flowing melody his fingers running along the various holes
soon the tallest silver haired elf nari raised his voice and sang
