the entryway beyond was long and ornate furnished with three circular seats upholstered with red fabric set in a line down the middle of the room
embroidered hangings decorated the walls along with the dwarves ubiquitous flameless lanterns while the ceiling had been carved to depict a famous battle from dwarven history
orik stood consulting with a group of his warriors and several gray bearded dwarves of durgrimst ingeitum
as eragon approached orik turned toward him his face grim
good you did not ** hundfast you may retire to your quarters now
we must needs speak in private
eragon is translator bowed and disappeared through an archway to the left his footsteps echoing on the polished agate floor
once he was out of hearing eragon said you do not trust him
orik shrugged
i do not know whom to trust at the moment the fewer people who know what we have discovered the better
we cannot risk the news escaping to another clan before tomorrow
if it does it will certainly mean a clan ** the dwarves behind him muttered among themselves appearing disconcerted
what is your news though asked eragon worried
the warriors gathered behind orik moved aside as he gestured at them revealing as they did so three bound and bloodied dwarves stacked on top of one another in the corner
the dwarf on the bottom groaned and kicked his feet in the air but was unable to extricate himself from under his fellow prisoners
orik replied i had several of our smiths examine the daggers your attackers carried
they identified the craftsmanship as that of one kiefna long nose a bladesmith of our clan who has achieved great renown among our people
so he can tell us who bought the daggers and thus who our enemies are
a brusque laugh shook orik is chest
hardly but we were able to track the daggers from kiefna to an armorer in dalgon many leagues from here who sold them to a knurlaf with
orik scowled
a woman
a woman with seven fingers on each hand bought the daggers two months ago
and did you find her there can not be very many women with that number of fingers
actually the condition is fairly common among our people said orik
be that as it may after quite a bit of difficulty we managed to locate the woman in dalgon
my warriors there questioned her most closely
she is of durgrimst nagra but so far as we can determine she was acting of her own accord and not under orders from the leaders of her clan
from her we learned that a dwarf had engaged her to buy the daggers and then to deliver them to a wine merchant who would take them with him from dalgon
the woman is employer did not tell her where the daggers were destined but by asking among the merchants of the city we discovered that he traveled directly from dalgon to one of the cities held by durgrimst az sweldn rak anhuin
so it was ** eragon exclaimed
that or it could have been someone who wished us to think it was them
we needed more evidence before we could establish az sweldn rak anhuin is guilt for ** a twinkle appeared in orik is eyes and he raised a finger
so by means of a very very clever spell we retraced the path of the assassins back through the tunnels and caves and up to a deserted area on the twelfth level of tronjheim off the subadjunct auxiliary hall of the southern spoke in the western quadrant along the
ah well it does not matter
but someday i will have to teach you how the rooms are arranged in tronjheim so that if ever you need to find a place within the city by yourself you can
in any event the trail led us to an abandoned storeroom where those three he gestured toward the bound dwarves had been staying
they were not expecting us and so we were able to capture them alive although they tried to kill themselves
it was not easy but we broke the minds of two of them leaving the third for the other grimstborithn to interrogate at their pleasure and we took from them everything they knew about this ** orik pointed at the prisoners again
it was they who equipped the assassins for the attack gave them the daggers and their black clothes and fed and sheltered them last night
