she dipped her head toward the crowd and then walked back to eragon crushing rose petals under her feet
thank you she said to him
for helping me
it was your emotions that showed me the way
without them i might have stayed there for weeks before i felt inspired to fix isidar mithrim
lifting his arms orik quieted the crowd and then he said on behalf of our entire race i thank you for your gift saphira
today you have restored the pride of our realm and we shall not forget your deed
let it not be said that knurlan are an ungrateful lot from now until the end of time your name shall be recited at the winter festivals along with the lists of master makers and when isidar mithrim is returned to its setting at the peak of tronjheim your name will be engraved in the collar surrounding the star rose along with that of durok ornthrond who first gave shape to the jewel
to both eragon and saphira orik said once again you have demonstrated your friendship to mine people
it pleases me that by your actions you have vindicated my foster father is decision to adopt you into durgrimst ingeitum
when the celebrations had died down some and most of the dwarves were deep in their cups eragon leaned toward orik who sat at the head of the stone table and said your majesty
orik waved a hand
i wo not have you calling me your majesty all the time eragon
it wo not do
unless the occasion demands it use mine name as you always have
that is an ** he reached for his goblet but missed and nearly knocked the container over
he laughed
smiling eragon said orik i have to ask was that really guntera who crowned you
orik is chin sank to his chest and he fingered the stem of the goblet his expression growing serious
it was as close to guntera as we are ever likely to see on this earth
does that answer your question eragon
i
i think so
does he always answer when called upon has he ever refused to crown one of your rulers
the gap between orik is eyebrows narrowed
have you ever heard of the heretic kings and the heretic queens before
they are knurlan who failed to secure guntera is blessing as our next ruler and yet who nevertheless insisted upon taking the ** orik is mouth twisted
without exception their reigns were short and unhappy ones
a band seemed to tighten around eragon is chest
so even though the clanmeet elected you their leader if guntera had failed to crown you you would not be king now
that or i would be king of a nation at war with ** orik shrugged
i was not overly worried about the possibility
with the varden in the midst of invading the empire only a madman would risk tearing our country apart merely to deny me the throne and while guntera is many things he is not mad
but you did not know for certain said eragon
orik shook his head
not until he placed the helm upon mine head
