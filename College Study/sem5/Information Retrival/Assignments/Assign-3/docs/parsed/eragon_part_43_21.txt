shocked silence filled the study
then jormundur swore explosively and began asking questions at the same time orik did
arya remained silent
ajihad raised his hands
** there is more
the urgals are not approachingover land butunder it
they re in the tunnels
we re going to be attacked from below
eragon raised his voice in the din that followed
why did not the dwarves know about this sooner how did the urgals find the tunnels
we re lucky to know about it this ** bellowed orik
everyone stopped talking to hear him
there are hundreds of tunnels throughout the beor mountains uninhabited since the day they were mined
the only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who do not want contact with anyone
we could have just as easily received no warning at all
ajihad pointed at the map and eragon moved closer
the map depicted the southern half of alagaesia but unlike eragon is it showed the entire beor mountain range in detail
ajihad is finger was on the section of the beor mountains that touched surda is eastern border
this he said is where the dwarf claimed to have come from
** exclaimed orik
at jormundur is puzzled inquiry he explained it is an ancient dwelling of ours that was deserted when tronjheim was completed
during its time it was the greatest of our cities
but no one is lived there for centuries
and it is old enough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed said ajihad
that is how we surmise it was discovered from the surface
i suspect that orthiad is now being called ithro zhada
that is where the urgal column that was chasing eragon and saphira was supposed to go and i am sure it is where the urgals have been migrating all year
from ithro zhada they can travel anywhere they want in the beor mountains
they have the power to destroy both the varden and the dwarves
jormundur bent over the map eyeing it carefully
do you know how many urgals there are are galbatorix is troops with them we can not plan a defense without knowing how large their army is
ajihad replied unhappily we re unsure about both those things yet our survival rests on that last question
if galbatorix has augmented the urgals ranks with his own men we do not stand a chance
but if he has not because he still does not want his alliance with the urgals revealed or for some other reason it is possible we can win
neither orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour
even so i sent runners to both of them with news of our plight
at the very least they wo not be caught by surprise if we fall
he drew a hand across his coal black brow
i ve already talked with hrothgar and we ve decided on a course of action
our only hope is to contain the urgals in three of the larger tunnels and channel them into farthen dur so they do not swarm inside tronjheim like locusts
i need you eragon and arya to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels
the job is too big for normal means
two groups of dwarves are already working on it one outside tronjheim the other beneath it
eragon you re to work with the group outside
arya you will be with the one underground orik will guide you to them
why not collapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched asked eragon
because said orik that would force the urgals to clear away the rubble and they might decide to go in a direction we do not want them to
plus if we cut ourselves off they could attack other dwarf cities which we would not be able to assist in time
there is also another reason said ajihad
hrothgar warned me that tronjheim sits on such a dense network of tunnels that if too many are weakened sections of the city will sink into the ground under their own weight
we can not risk that
jormundur listened intently then asked so there wo not be any fighting inside tronjheim you said the urgals would be channeled outside the city into farthen dur
ajihad responded quickly that is right
we can not defend tronjheim is entire perimeter it is too big for our forces so we re going to seal all the passageways and gates leading into it
that will force the urgals out onto the flats surrounding tronjheim where there is plenty of maneuvering room for our armies
