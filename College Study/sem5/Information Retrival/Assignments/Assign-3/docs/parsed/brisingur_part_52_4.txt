because i have not the metal i ** rhunon growled
you do not think that i forged the riders swords out of ordinary steel do you ** long ago while i was wandering through du weldenvarden i happened upon fragments of a shooting star that had fallen to the earth
the pieces contained an ore unlike any i had handled before and so i returned with it to my forge and i refined it and i discovered that the mix of steel that resulted was stronger harder and more flexible than any of earthly origin
i named the metal brightsteel on account of its uncommon brilliance and when queen tarmunora asked me to forge the first of the riders swords it was brightsteel i used
thereafter whenever i had the opportunity i would search the forest for more fragments of the star metal
i did not often find any but when i did i would save them for the riders
over the centuries the fragments became ever more rare until at last i began to think none were left
it took me four and twenty years to find the last deposit
from it i forged seven swords among them undbitr and zar roc
since the riders fell i have searched for brightsteel only once more and that was last night after oromis spoke to me about ** rhunon tilted her head and her watery eyes bored into eragon
i wandered far and wide and i cast many spells of finding and binding but i came across not a single speck of brightsteel
if some could be procured then we might begin to consider a sword for you shadeslayer
otherwise this discussion is no more than pointless blathering
eragon bowed to the elf woman and thanked her for her time then he and saphira left the atrium through the green leafy tunnel of dogwood
as they walked side by side toward a glade from which saphira could take off eragon said brightsteel that has to be what solembum meant
there must be brightsteel underneath the menoa tree
perhaps the tree told him herself
does it matter
brightsteel or not she said how are we supposed to get at anything that the roots of the menoa tree cover we cannot chop through them
we do not even know where to chop
i have to think about it
while the two dragons danced among the clouds oromis taught eragon how a magician could transport an object from one place to another without having the object traverse the intervening distance
most forms of magic said oromis require ever more energy to sustain as the distance between you and your target increases
however that is not the case in this particular instance
it would require the same amount of energy to send the rock in my hand to the other side of that stream as it would to send it all the way to the southern isles
for that reason the spell is most useful when you need to transport an item with magic across a distance so vast it would kill you to move it normally through space
even so it is a demanding spell and you should only resort to it if all else has failed
to shift something as large as saphira is egg for example would leave you too exhausted to move
then oromis taught eragon the wording of the spell and several variations on it
once he had memorized the incantations to oromis is satisfaction the elf had him attempt to shift the small rock he was holding
as soon as eragon uttered the spell in its entirety the rock vanished from the palm of oromis is hand and an instant later re appeared in the middle of the clearing with a flash of blue light a loud detonation and a surge of burning hot air
eragon flinched from the noise and then gripped the branch of a nearby tree to steady himself as his knees buckled and cold crept over his limbs
his scalp tingled as he gazed at the rock which lay in a circle of charred and flattened grass and he remembered the moment when he had first beheld saphira is egg
well done said oromis
now can you tell me why the stone made that sound when it materialized in the grass
eragon paid close attention to everything oromis said but throughout the lesson he continued to ponder the question of the menoa tree even as he knew saphira did as she soared high above
the longer he considered it the more he despaired of ever finding a solution
