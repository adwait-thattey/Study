the dwarf with the javelin pursued him twice around the lists
when they were close enough he rose up in his stirrups and cast the spear striking the cowardly dwarf in the back of his left shoulder
with a howl the dwarf fell off his steed and lay on his side clutching at the blade and shaft embedded in his flesh
a healer rushed toward him
after a moment everyone turned their backs on the spectacle
orik is upper lip curved with disgust
** it will be many years before his family is able to erase the stain of their son is dishonor
i am sorry you have had to witness this contemptible act eragon
it is never enjoyable watching someone shame themselves
the three of them sat in silence through the next two contests then orik startled eragon by grasping him by the shoulder and asking how would you like to see a forest of stone eragon
no such thing exists unless it is carved
orik shook his head his eyes twinkling
it is not carved and it does exist
so i ask again would you like to see a forest of stone
if you are not jesting
yes i would
ah i am glad you accepted
i do not jest and i promise you that tomorrow you and i shall walk among trees of granite
it is one of the wonders of the beor mountains
everyone who is a guest of durgrimst ingeitum should have an opportunity to visit it
i missed her during the trip from helgrind he thought but at least i knew i was returning to her as fast as i could
now i am traveling away from her and i do not know when we will be reunited
shaking himself he dressed and made his way through the winding corridors of bregan hold bowing to the dwarves he passed who for their part greeted him with energetic reiterations of **
he found orik and twelve other dwarves in the courtyard of the hold saddling a line of sturdy ponies whose breath formed white plumes in the cold air
eragon felt like a giant as the short burly men moved about him
orik hailed him
we have a donkey in our stables if you would like to ride
no i will continue on foot if it is all the same to you
when they were ready to depart hvedra descended the broad stone steps from the entrance to the main hall of bregan hold her dress trailing behind her and presented to orik an ivory horn clad with gold filigree around the mouth and bell
she said this was mine father is when he rode with grimstborith aldhrim
i give it to you so you may remember me in the days to ** she said more in dwarvish so softly eragon could not hear and then she and orik touched foreheads
straightening in his saddle orik placed the horn to his lips and winded it
a deep rousing note rang forth increasing in volume until the air within the courtyard seemed to vibrate like a wind sawed rope
a pair of black ravens rose from the tower above cawing
the sound of the horn made eragon is blood tingle
he shifted in place eager to be gone
lifting the horn over his head and with a final look at hvedra orik spurred his pony forward trotted out of the main gates of bregan hold and turned east toward the head of the valley
eragon and the twelve other dwarves followed close behind
for three hours they followed a well worn trail across the side of thardur mountain climbing ever higher above the valley floor
the dwarves drove the ponies as fast as they could without injuring the animals but their pace was still only a fraction of eragon is speed when he was free to run unchecked
although he was frustrated eragon refrained from complaining for he realized that it was inevitable he would have to travel slower with any but elves or kull
he shivered and pulled his cloak closer around himself
the sun had yet to appear over the beor mountains and a damp chill pervaded the valley even though noon was only a few hours away
then they came upon a flat expanse of granite over a thousand feet wide bordered on the right by a slanting cliff of naturally formed octagonal pillars
curtains of shifting mist obscured the far end of the stone field
orik raised a hand and said behold az knurldrathn
eragon frowned
stare as he might he could discern nothing of interest in the barren location
