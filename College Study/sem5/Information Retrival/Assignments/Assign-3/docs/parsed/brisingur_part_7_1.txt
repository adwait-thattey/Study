the rock reflected his voice as he repeated a phrase in the ancient language over and over again
it was not magic but rather a message to the remaining ra zac
what he said meant this come o thou eater of men is flesh let us end this fight of ours
you are hurt and i am weary
your companions are dead and i am alone
we are a fit match
i promise that i shall not use gramarye against you nor hurt or trap you with spells i have already cast
come o thou eater of men is flesh let us end this fight of ours
the time during which he spoke seemed endless a neverwhen in a ghastly tinted chamber that remained unchanged through an eternity of cycling words whose order and significance ceased to matter to him
after a time his clamoring thoughts fell silent and a strange calm crept over him
he paused with his mouth open then closed it watchful
thirty feet in front of him stood the ra zac
blood dripped from the hem of the creature is ragged robes
my massster does not want me to kill you it hissed
but that does not matter to you now
no
if i fall to your staff let galbatorix deal with you as he will
he has more heartsss than you do
eragon laughed
hearts i am the champion of the people not him
foolish ** the ra zac cocked its head slightly looking past him at the corpse of the other ra zac farther up the tunnel
she was my hatchmate
you have become ssstrong since we firssst met shadeslayer
will you make a pact with me shadeslayer
i am the lassst of my race shadeslayer
we are ancient and i would not have us forgotten
would you in your songsss and in your hissstories remind your fellow humans of the terror we inssspired in your kind
remember us as **
why should i do that for you
tucking its beak against its narrow chest the ra zac clucked and chittered to itself for several moments
because it said i will tell you sssomething secret yesss i will
give me your word firssst lest you trick me
no
tell me and then i will decide whether or not to agree
over a minute passed and neither of them moved although eragon kept his muscles taut and ready in expectation of a surprise attack
after another squall of sharp clicks the ra zac said he has almossst found the name
the ra zac hissed with frustration
i cannot tell ** the ** the true **
you have to give me more information than that
curssse you ** i curssse ** may you find no roossst nor den nor peace of mind in thisss land of yours
may you leave alagaesia and never **
the nape of eragon is neck prickled with the cold touch of dread
in his mind he again heard the words of angela the herbalist when she had cast her dragon bones for him and told his fortune and predicted that selfsame fate
a mare is tail of blood separated eragon from his enemy as the ra zac swept back its sodden cloak revealing a bow that it held with an arrow already fit to the string
lifting and drawing the weapon the ra zac loosed the bolt in the direction of eragon is chest
eragon batted the shaft aside with his staff
as if this attempt were nothing more than a preliminary gesture that custom dictated they observe before proceeding with their actual confrontation the ra zac stooped placed the bow on the floor then straightened its cowl and slowly and deliberately pulled its leaf bladed sword from underneath its robes
while it did eragon rose to his feet and took a shoulder wide stance his hands tight on the staff
they lunged toward each other
the ra zac attempted to cleave eragon from collarbone to hip but eragon twisted and stepped past the blow
jamming the end of the staff upward he drove its metal spike underneath the ra zac is beak and through the plates that protected the creature is throat
the ra zac shuddered once and then collapsed
eragon stared at his most hated foe stared at its lidless black eyes and suddenly he went weak at the knees and retched against the wall of the corridor
wiping his mouth he yanked the staff free and whispered for our father
for our home
for carvahall
for brom
i have had my fill of vengeance
may you rot here forever ra zac
going to the appropriate cell eragon retrieved sloan who was still deep in his enchanted sleep slung the butcher over his shoulder and then began to retrace his steps back to the main cave of helgrind
