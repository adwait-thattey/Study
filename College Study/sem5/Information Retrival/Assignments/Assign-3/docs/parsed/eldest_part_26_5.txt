if you abandon her she will be the meanest person in carvahall forced to live off her friends our first and only beggar
by the blood in my veins i wo not let that happen
nor would i protested roran
i would have to be heartless or worse to do so
elain jerked her chin
exactly
do not forget that you intend to marry a woman who has lost both her dowry and her mother is inheritance
do you understand what it means for katrina to lose her inheritance she has no silver no linens no lace nor any of the things needed for a well run home
such items are all we own passed from mother to daughter since the day we first settled alagaesia
they determine our worth
a woman without her inheritance is like
is like
is like a man without a farm or a trade said roran
just so
it was cruel of sloan to deny katrina her inheritance but that can not be helped now
both you and she have no money or resources
life is difficult enough without that added hardship
you will be starting from nothing and with nothing
does the prospect frighten you or seem unbearable so i ask you once again and do not lie or the two of you will regret it for the rest of your lives will you care for her without grudge or resentment
elain sighed and filled two earthen cups with cider from a jug hanging among the rafters
she handed one to roran as she seated herself back at the table
then i suggest that you devote yourself to replacing katrina is home and inheritance so that she and any daughters you may have can stand without shame among the wives of carvahall
roran sipped the cool cider
if we live that long
** she brushed back a strand of her blond hair and shook her head
you ve chosen a hard path roran
i had to make sure that katrina would leave carvahall
elain lifted an eyebrow
so that was it
well i wo not argue about it but why on earth did not you speak to sloan about your engagement before this morning when horst asked my father he gave our family twelve sheep a sow and eight pairs of wrought iron candlesticks before he even knew if my parents would agree
that is how it should be done
surely you could have thought of a better strategy than striking your father in law to be
a painful laugh escaped roran
i could have but it never seemed the right time with all the attacks
the ra zac have not attacked for almost six days now
he scowled
no but
it was
oh i do not ** he banged his fist on the table with frustration
elain put down her cup and wrapped her tiny hands around his
if you can mend this rift between you and sloannow before years of resentment accumulate your life with katrina will be much much easier
tomorrow morning you should go to his house and beg his forgiveness
i wo not ** not to him
roran listen to me
it is worth a month of begging to have peace in your family
i know from experience strife does naught but make you miserable
sloan hates the spine
he will have nothing to do with me
you have to try though said elain earnestly
even if he spurns your apology at least you can not be blamed for not making the effort
if you love katrina then swallow your pride and do what is right for her
do not make her suffer for your ** she finished her cider used a tin hat to snuff the candles and left roran sitting alone in the dark
several minutes elapsed before roran could bring himself to stir
he stretched out an arm and traced along the counter is edge until he felt the doorway then proceeded upstairs all the while running the tips of his fingers over the carved walls to keep his balance
in his room he disrobed and threw himself lengthwise on the bed
wrapping his arms around his wool stuffed pillow roran listened to the faint sounds that drifted through the house at night the scrabble of a mouse in the attic and its intermittent squeaks the groan of wood beams cooling in the night the whisper and caress of wind at the lintel of his window and
and the rustle of slippers in the hall outside his room
he watched as the latch above the doorknob was pulled free of its hook then the door inched forward with a rasp of protest
it paused
a dark form slipped inside the door closed and roran felt a curtain of hair brush his face along with lips like rose petals
