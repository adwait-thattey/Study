on the burning plains murtagh was able to defeat the two of you she indicated eragon and saphira because you did not know that galbatorix might have given him some of the eldunari and thus you failed to act with appropriate caution
if not for murtagh is conscience you would both be trapped in galbatorix is service even now
oromis and glaedr and my mother too had sound reasons for keeping the eldunari a secret but their reticence was nearly our undoing
i will discuss this with my mother when next we speak
nasuada paced between the counter and the fireplace
you have given me much to think about eragon
she tapped the floor with the tip of her boot
for the first time in the history of the varden we know of a way to kill galbatorix that might actually succeed
if we can separate him from these heart of hearts he will lose the better part of his strength and then you and our other spellcasters will be able to overpower him
yes but how can we separate him from his hearts eragon asked
nasuada shrugged
i could not say but i am sure it must be possible
from now on you will work on devising a method
nothing else is as important
eragon felt arya studying him with unusual concentration
unsettled he made a questioning face at her
i always wondered said arya why saphira is egg appeared to you and not somewhere in an empty field
it seemed too great a coincidence to have occurred purely by chance but i could not think of any plausible explanation
now i understand
i should have guessed that you were brom is son
i did not know brom well but i did know him and you share a certain resemblance
you should be proud to call brom your father said nasuada
by all accounts he was a remarkable man
if not for him the varden would not exist
it seems fitting that you are the one to carry on his work
then arya said eragon may we see glaedr is eldunari
eragon hesitated then went outside and retrieved the pouch from saphira is saddlebags
careful not to touch the eldunari he loosened the drawstring at the top and allowed the pouch to slide down around the golden gemlike stone
in contrast to when he had last seen it the glow within the heart of hearts was dim and feeble as if glaedr were barely conscious
nasuada leaned forward and stared into the swirling center of the eldunari her eyes gleaming with reflected light
and glaedr is really inside of here
you could try but i doubt he would respond
he just lost his rider
it will take him a long time to recover from the shock if ever
please leave him be nasuada
if he wished to speak with you he would have done so already
of course
it was not my intention to disturb him in his time of grief
i shall wait to meet him until such time as he has regained his composure
arya moved closer to eragon and placed her hands on either side of the eldunari her fingers less than an inch away from its surface
she gazed at the stone with an expression of reverence seemingly lost within its depths then whispered something in the ancient language
glaedr is consciousness flared slightly as if in response
arya lowered her hands
eragon saphira you have been given the most solemn responsibility the safekeeping of another life
whatever happens you must protect glaedr
with oromis gone we shall need his strength and wisdom more than ever before
do not worry arya we wo not allow any misfortune to befall him saphira promised
eragon covered the eldunari with the pouch again and fumbled with the drawstring exhaustion rendering him clumsy
the varden had won an important victory and the elves had taken gil ead but the knowledge brought him little joy
he looked at nasuada and asked what now
nasuada lifted her chin
now she said we will march north to belatona and when we have captured it we will proceed onward to dras leona and seize it as well and then to uru baen where we will cast down galbatorix or die trying
that is what we shall do now eragon
eragon stared at the ground between his feet
he paid little attention to the men who ran or marched past his part in the battle was finished and all he wanted to do was lie down and forget the sorrows of the day
