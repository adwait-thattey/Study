they forced themselves to rise early in the gray predawn hours
eragon shivered in the cool air
how are we going to transport the elf she can not ride on saphira is back much longer without getting sores from her scales
saphira can not carry her in her claws it tires her and makes landing dangerous
a sledge wo not work it would get battered to pieces while we ride and i do not want the horses slowed by the weight of another person
murtagh considered the matter as he saddled tornac
if you were to ride saphira we could lash the elf onto snowfire but we d have the same problem with sores
i have a solution said saphira ** do not you tie the elf to my belly i will still be able to move freely and she will be safer than anywhere else
the only danger will be if soldiers shoot arrows at me but i can easily fly above those
none of them could come up with a better idea so they quickly adopted hers
eragon folded one of his blankets in half lengthwise secured it around the elf is petite form then took her to saphira
blankets and spare clothes were sacrificed to form ropes long enough to encircle saphira is girth
with those ropes the elf was tied back first against saphira is belly her head between saphira is front legs
eragon looked critically at their handiwork
i am afraid your scales may rub through the ropes
we will have to check them occasionally for fraying commented murtagh
shall we go now saphira asked and eragon repeated the question
murtagh is eyes sparked dangerously a tight smile lifting his lips
he glanced back the way they had come where smoke from soldiers camps was clearly visible and said i always did like races
and now we are in one for our **
murtagh swung into tornac is saddle and trotted out of the camp
eragon followed close behind on snowfire
saphira jumped into the air with the elf
she flew low to the ground to avoid being seen by the soldiers
in this fashion the three of them made their way southeast toward the distant hadarac desert
eragon kept a quick eye out for pursuers as he rode
his mind repeatedly wandered back to the ** ** he had actually seen one and she was with ** he wondered what roran would think of that
it struck him that if he ever returned to carvahall he would have a hard time convincing anyone that his adventures had actually occurred
for the rest of the day eragon and murtagh sped through the land ignoring discomfort and fatigue
they drove the horses as hard as they could without killing them
sometimes they dismounted and ran on foot to give tornac and snowfire a rest
only twice did they stop both times to let the horses eat and drink
though the soldiers of gil ead were far behind now eragon and murtagh found themselves having to avoid new soldiers every time they passed a town or village
somehow the alarm had been sent ahead of them
twice they were nearly ambushed along the trail escaping only because saphira happened to smell the men ahead of them
after the second incident they avoided the trail entirely
dusk softened the countryside as evening drew a black cloak across the sky
through the night they traveled relentlessly pacing out the miles
in the deepest hours of night the ground rose beneath them to form low cactus dotted hills
murtagh pointed forward
there is a town bullridge some leagues ahead that we must bypass
they re sure to have soldiers watching for us
we should try to slip past them now while it is dark
after three hours they saw the straw yellow lanterns of bullridge
a web of soldiers patrolled between watch fires scattered around the town
eragon and murtagh muffled their sword sheaths and carefully dismounted
they led the horses in a wide detour around bullridge listening attentively to avoid stumbling on an encampment
with the town behind them eragon relaxed slightly
daybreak finally flooded the sky with a delicate blush and warmed the chilly night air
they halted on the crest of a hill to observe their surroundings
the ramr river was to their left but it was also five miles to their right
the river continued south for several leagues then doubled back on itself in a narrow loop before curving west
