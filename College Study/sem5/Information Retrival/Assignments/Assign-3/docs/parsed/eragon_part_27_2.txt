it was quiet outside the room except for the occasional watchman
suddenly eragon is neck prickled
he tried to keep working but the uneasy feeling remained
irritated he looked up and jerked with surprise a small boy crouched on the windowsill
his eyes were slanted and a sprig of holly was woven into his shaggy black hair
do you need help asked a voice in eragon is head
his eyes widened with shock
it sounded like solembum
eragon gulped and concentrated on his scroll
if my eyes do not deceive me you are
the boy smiled slightly revealing pointed ** i look like does not change who i am
you do not think i am called a werecat for nothing do you
what are you doing here eragon asked
the werecat tilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an ** depends on what you are doing here
if you are reading those scrolls for entertainment then i suppose there is not any reason for my visit
but if what you are doing is unlawful and you do not want to be discovered i might be here to warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you and that this second official of the empire has sent soldiers to search for you
thank you for telling me said eragon
told you something did i i suppose i did
and i suggest you make use of it
the boy stood and tossed back his wild hair
eragon asked quickly what did you mean last time about the tree and the vault
eragon tried to ask more but the werecat vanished through the window
he announced abruptly there are soldiers looking for us
how do you know asked brom sharply
i listened in on the guard
his replacement just sent men to search for us
we have to get out of here
they ve probably already discovered that jeod is office is empty
** said eragon impatiently
they re on their way
brom snatched another scroll from the rack
no matter
we have to finish this ** they worked furiously for the next minute scanning the records as fast as they could
as the last scroll was finished brom threw it back onto the rack and jeod jammed his parchment ink and pen into his pouch
eragon grabbed the torch
they raced from the room and shut the door but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of soldiers boots at the end of the hall
they turned to leave but brom hissed furiously ** it is not ** he put his hand against the door
the lock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers came into view
** get away from that ** shouted one of them
brom stepped back assuming a surprised expression
the three men marched up to them
the tallest one demanded why are you trying to get into the records eragon gripped his bow tighter and prepared to run
i am afraid we lost our ** the strain was evident in jeod is voice
a drop of sweat rolled down his neck
the soldier glared at them suspiciously
check inside the room he ordered one of his men
eragon held his breath as the soldier stepped up to the door tried to open it then pounded on it with his mailed fist
it is locked sir
the leader scratched his chin
ar right then
i do not know what you were up to but as long as the door is locked i guess you re free to go
come ** the soldiers surrounded them and marched them back to the keep
i can not believe it thought ** re helping us get away
at the main gates the soldier pointed and said now you walk through those and do not try anything
we will be watching
if you have to come back wait until morning
eragon could feel the guards eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the castle
the moment that the gates closed behind them a triumphant grin stretched across his face and he jumped into the air
brom shot him a cautioning look and growled walk back to the house normally
you can celebrate there
chastised eragon adopted a staid demeanor but inside he still bubbled with energy
once they had hurried back to the house and into the study eragon exclaimed we did **
yes but now we have to figure out if it was worth the trouble said brom
jeod took a map of alagaesia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk
on the left side of the map the ocean extended to the unknown west
along the coast stretched the spine an immense length of mountains
