eragon woke from his nap to a golden sunset
red and orange beams of light streamed into the room and fell across the bed
they warmed his back pleasantly making him reluctant to move
he dozed but the sunlight crept off him and he grew cold
the sun sank below the horizon lighting the sea and sky with ** time
he slung his bow and quiver on his back but left zar roc in the room the sword would only slow him and he was averse to using it
if he had to disable someone he could use magic or an arrow
he pulled his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely
he waited nervously in his room until the light faded
then he entered the hallway and shrugged so the quiver settled comfortably across his back
brom joined him carrying his sword and staff
jeod dressed in a black doublet and hose was waiting for them outside
from his waist swung an elegant rapier and a leather pouch
brom eyed the rapier and observed that toad sticker is too thin for any real fighting
what will you do if someone comes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge
be realistic said jeod
none of the guards has a flamberge
besides thistoad sticker is faster than a broadsword
they walked casually along the street avoiding watchmen and soldiers
eragon was tense and his heart pounded
as they passed angela is shop a flash of movement on the roof caught his attention but he saw no one
his palm tingled
he looked at the roof again but it was still empty
brom led them along teirm is outer wall
by the time they reached the castle the sky was black
the sealed walls of the fortress made eragon shiver
he would hate to be imprisoned there
jeod silently took the lead and strode up to the gates trying to look at ease
he pounded on the gate and waited
a small grille slid open and a surly guard peered out
ya he grunted shortly
eragon could smell rum on his breath
we need to get in said jeod
the guard peered at jeod closer
wha for
the boy here left something very valuable in my office
we have to retrieve it ** eragon hung his head shamefaced
the guard frowned clearly impatient to get back to his bottle
ah wha ever he said swinging his arm
jus make sure n give im a good beating f r me
i will do that assured jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate
they entered the keep then brom handed the guard a few coins
thank ee mumbled the man tottering away
as soon as he was gone eragon pulled his bow from its tube and strung it
jeod quickly let them into the main part of the castle
they hurried toward their destination listening carefully for any soldiers on patrol
at the records room brom tried the door
it was locked
he put his hand against the door and muttered a word that eragon did not recognize
it swung open with a faint click
brom grabbed a torch from the wall and they darted inside closing the door quietly
the squat room was filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls
a barred window was set in the far wall
jeod threaded his way between the racks running his eyes over the scrolls
he halted at the back of the room
over here he said
these are the shipping records for the past five years
you can tell the date by the wax seals on the corner
so what do we do now asked eragon pleased that they had made it so far without being discovered
start at the top and work down said jeod
some scrolls only deal with taxes
you can ignore those
look for anything that mentions seithr ** he took a length of parchment from his pouch and stretched it out on the floor then set a bottle of ink and a quill pen next to it
so we can keep track of whatever we find he explained
brom scooped an armful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor
he sat and unrolled the first one
eragon joined him positioning himself so he could see the door
the tedious work was especially difficult for him as the cramped script on the scrolls was different from the printing brom had taught him
by looking only for the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas they winnowed out many of the scrolls
even so they moved down the rack slowly recording each shipment of seithr oil as they located it
