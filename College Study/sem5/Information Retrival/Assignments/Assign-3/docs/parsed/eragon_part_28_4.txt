if you kill the ra zac the only ways for you to escape galbatorix is wrath will be to seek the varden is protection flee to surda or plead for the king is mercy and join his forces
even if you do not kill the ra zac you will still face this choice eventually
eragon knew the best way to gain sanctuary might be to join the varden but he did not want to spend his entire life fighting the empire like they did
he mulled over brom is comments trying to consider them from every angle
you still did not explain how you know so much about dragons
no i did not did i said brom with a crooked smile
that will have to wait for another time
why me eragon asked himself
what made him so special that he should become a rider did you ever meet my mother he blurted
brom looked grave
yes i did
the old man sighed
she was full of dignity and pride like garrow
ultimately it was her downfall but it was one of her greatest gifts nevertheless
she always helped the poor and the less fortunate no matter what her situation
you knew her well asked eragon startled
well enough to miss her when she was gone
as cadoc plodded along eragon tried to recall when he had thought that brom was just a scruffy old man who told stories
for the first time eragon understood how ignorant he had been
he told saphira what he had learned
she was intrigued by brom is revelations but recoiled from the thought of being one of galbatorix is possessions
at last she said are not you glad that you did not stay in carvahall think of all the interesting experiences you would have ** eragon groaned in mock distress
when they stopped for the day eragon searched for water while brom made dinner
he rubbed his hands together for warmth as he walked in a large circle listening for a creek or spring
it was gloomy and damp between the trees
he found a stream a ways from the camp then crouched on the bank and watched the water splash over the rocks dipping in his fingertips
the icy mountain water swirled around his skin numbing ** does not care what happens to us or anyone else thought eragon
he shivered and stood
an unusual print on the opposing stream bank caught his attention
it was oddly shaped and very large
curious he jumped across the stream and onto a rock shelf
as he landed his foot hit a patch of damp moss
he grabbed a branch for support but it broke and he thrust out his hand to break his fall
he felt his right wrist crack as he hit the ground
pain lanced up his arm
a steady stream of curses came out from behind his clenched teeth as he tried not to howl
half blind with pain he curled on the ground cradling his ** came saphira is alarmed ** happened
broke my wrist
did something stupid
fell
no i can make it back
do not
come
trees too close for
wings
she sent him a brief image of her tearing the forest apart to get at him then said hurry
groaning he staggered upright
the print was pressed deeply into the ground a few feet away
it was the mark of a heavy nail studded boot
eragon instantly remembered the tracks that had surrounded the pile of bodies in yazuac
urgal he spat wishing that zar roc was with him he could not use his bow with only one hand
his head snapped up and he shouted with his mind ** ** keep brom safe
eragon leapt back over the stream and raced toward their camp yanking out his hunting knife
he saw potential enemies behind every tree and ** hope there is only one urgal
he burst into the camp ducking as saphira is tail swung overhead
stop
it is ** he yelled
oops said saphira
her wings were folded in front of her chest like a wall
oops growled eragon running to her
you could ve killed ** where is brom
i am right here snapped brom is voice from behind saphira is wings
tell your crazy dragon to release me she wo not listen to me
let him ** said eragon exasperated
did not you tell him
no she said ** just said to keep him safe
she lifted her wings and brom stepped forward angrily
i found an urgal footprint
and it is fresh
brom immediately turned serious
saddle the horses
we re ** he put out the fire but eragon did not move
what is wrong with your arm
