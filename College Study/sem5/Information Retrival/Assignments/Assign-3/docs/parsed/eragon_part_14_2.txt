eragon slid off without waiting for her to fold her wings
as he struck the ground his knees buckled and his cheek slammed against the snow
he gasped as excruciating pain seared through his legs sending tears to his eyes
his muscles cramped from clenching for so long shook violently
he rolled onto his back shivering and stretched his limbs as best he could
then he forced himself to look down
two large blots darkened his wool pants on the insides of his thighs
he touched the fabric
it was wet
alarmed he peeled off the pants and grimaced
the insides of his legs were raw and bloody
the skin was gone rubbed off by saphira is hard scales
he gingerly felt the abrasions and winced
cold bit into him as he pulled the pants back on and he cried out as they scraped against the sensitive wounds
he tried to stand but his legs would not support him
the deepening night obscured his surroundings the shaded mountains were unfamiliar
i am in the spine i do not know where during the middle of winter with a crazed dragon unable to walk or find shelter
night is falling
i have to get back to the farm tomorrow
and the only way to do that is to fly which i can not endure ** took a deep ** i wish saphira could breathe fire
he turned his head and saw her next to him crouched low to the ground
he put a hand on her side and found it trembling
the barrier in her mind was gone
without it her fear scorched through him
he clamped down on it and slowly soothed her with gentle ** do the strangers frighten you
garrow is in danger and you kidnap me on this ridiculous ** are you unable to protect me she growled deeply and snapped her ** but if you think you can why run
he leaned on one elbow and stifled his ** look where we ** the sun is down and your flight has stripped my legs as easily as i would scale a fish
is that what you wanted
then why did you do it he demanded
through his link with saphira he felt her regret for his pain but not for her actions
she looked away and refused to answer
the icy temperature deadened eragon is legs although it lessened the pain he knew that his condition was not good
he changed ** am going to freeze unless you make me a shelter or hollow so i can stay warm
even a pile of pine needles and branches would do
she seemed relieved that he had stopped interrogating ** is no need
i will curl around you and cover you with my wings the fire inside me will stay the cold
eragon let his head thump back on the ** but scrape the snow off the ground
it will be more comfortable
in answer saphira razed a drift with her tail clearing it with one powerful stroke
she swept over the site again to remove the last few inches of hardened snow
he eyed the exposed dirt with ** can not walk over there
you will have to help me to it
her head larger than his torso swung over him and came to rest by his side
he stared at her large sapphire colored eyes and wrapped his hands around one of her ivory spikes
she lifted her head and slowly dragged him to the bare ** gently
stars danced in his eyes as he slid over a rock but he managed to hold on
after he let go saphira rolled on her side exposing her warm belly
he huddled against the smooth scales of her underside
her right wing extended over him and enclosed him in complete darkness forming a living tent
almost immediately the air began to lose its frigidity
he pulled his arms inside his coat and tied the empty sleeves around his neck
for the first time he noticed that hunger gnawed at his stomach
but it did not distract him from his main worry could he get back to the farm before the strangers did and if not what would happen even if i can force myself to ride saphira again it will be at least midafternoon before we get back
the strangers could be there long before that
he closed his eyes and felt a single tear slide down his ** have i done
