his laughter reduced to a wheezing chuckle as blood seeped into his lungs the soldier continued moving forward painting the grass underneath him bright scarlet
the archers shot again and arrows sprouted from the man is shoulders and arms but he did not stop
another volley of arrows followed close upon the last
the soldier stumbled and fell as an arrow split his left kneecap and others skewered his upper legs and one passed entirely through his neck punching a hole in his birthmark and whistled out across the field trailing a spray of blood
and still the soldier refused to die
he began to crawl dragging himself forward with his arms grinning and giggling as if the whole world were an obscene joke that only he could appreciate
a cold tingle shivered down eragon is spine as he watched
king orrin swore violently and eragon detected a hint of hysteria in his voice
jumping off his charger orrin threw his sword and his shield into the dirt and then pointed at the nearest urgal
give me your ** startled the gray skinned urgal hesitated then surrendered his weapon
king orrin limped over to the soldier raised the heavy ax with both hands and with a single blow chopped off the soldier is head
the soldier is eyes rolled and his mouth worked for another few seconds and then he was still
orrin grasped the head by the hair and lifted it so all could see
they can be killed he declared
spread the word that the only sure way of stopping these abominations is to behead them
that or bash in their skulls with a mace or shoot them in the eye from a safe distance
graytooth where are you a stout middle aged horseman urged his mount forward
orrin threw him the head which he caught
mount that on a pole by the north gate of the camp
mount all of their heads
let them serve as a message to galbatorix that we do not fear his underhanded tricks and we shall prevail in spite of ** striding back to his charger orrin returned the ax to the urgal then picked up his own weapons
a few yards away eragon spotted nar garzhvog standing among a cluster of kull
eragon spoke a few words to saphira and she sidled over to the urgals
after exchanging nods eragon asked garzhvog were all the soldiers like that he gestured toward the arrow riddled corpse
all men with no pain
you hit them and you think them dead turn your back and they hamstring ** garzhvog scowled
i lost many rams today
we have fought droves of humans firesword but never before these laughing ghouls
it is not natural
it makes us think they are possessed by hornless spirits that maybe the gods themselves have turned against us
nonsense scoffed eragon
it is merely a spell by galbatorix and we shall soon have a way to protect ourselves against ** notwithstanding his outer confidence the concept of fighting enemies who felt no pain unsettled him as much as it did the urgals
moreover from what garzhvog had said he guessed that maintaining morale among the varden was going to be even more difficult for nasuada once everyone learned about the soldiers
while the varden and the urgals set about collecting their fallen comrades stripping the dead of useful equipment and beheading the soldiers and dragging their truncated bodies into piles to burn eragon saphira and king orrin returned to the camp accompanied by arya and the other elves
along the way eragon offered to heal orrin is leg but the king refused saying i have my own physicians shadeslayer
nasuada and jormundur were waiting for them by the north gate
accosting orrin nasuada said what went wrong
eragon closed his eyes as orrin explained how at first the attack on the soldiers had seemed to go well
the horsemen had swept through their ranks dealing what they had thought were death blows left and right and had suffered only one casualty during their charge
when they had engaged the remaining soldiers however many of those they had struck down before rose up and rejoined the fight
orrin shuddered
we lost our nerve then
any man would have
we did not know if the soldiers were invincible or if they were even men at all
