it was night so he could not be sure of their numbers but he was certain that the host was far larger than the sixteen thousand that form the core of galbatorix is troops
there may have been as many as a hundred thousand soldiers or more
a hundred ** cold pit of fear settled in nasuada is stomach
can we trust your source
his intelligence has always been reliable
i do not understand said nasuada
how could galbatorix move that many men without our knowing of it before the supply trains alone would be miles long
it is been obvious the army was mobilizing but the empire was nowhere near ready to deploy
falberd spoke then slapping a heavy hand on the table for emphasis we were outfoxed
our spies must have been deceived with magic to think the army was still in their barracks in gil ead
nasuada felt the blood drain from her face
the only person strong enough to sustain an illusion of that size and duration
is galbatorix himself completed orrin
that was our conclusion
it means that galbatorix has finally abandoned his lair in favor of open combat
even as we speak the black foe approaches
irwin leaned forward
the question now is how we should respond
we must confront this threat of course but in what manner where when and how our own forces are not prepared for a campaign of this magnitude while yours lady nasuada the varden are already accustomed to the fierce clamor of war
what do you mean to imply that we should die for you
i but made an observation
take it how you will
then orrin said alone we will be crushed against an army so large
we must have allies and above all else we must have eragon especially if we are to confront galbatorix
nasuada will you send for him
i would if i could but until arya returns i have no way to contact the elves or to summon eragon
in that case said orrin in a heavy voice we must hope that she arrives before it is too late
i do not suppose we can expect the elves assistance in this affair
while a dragon may traverse the leagues between aberon and ellesmera with the speed of a falcon it would be impossible for the elves to marshal themselves and cross that same distance before the empire reaches us
that leaves only the dwarves
i know that you have been friends with hrothgar for many years will you send him a plea for help on our behalf the dwarves have always promised they would fight when the time came
nasuada nodded
du vrangr gata has an arrangement with certain dwarf magicians that allows us to transfer messages instantaneously
i will convey your our request
and i will ask hrothgar to send an emissary to ceris to inform the elves of the situation so that they are forewarned if nothing else
good
we are quite a ways from farthen dur but if we can delay the empire for even a week the dwarves might be able to get here in time
the discussion that followed was an exceedingly grim one
various tactics existed for defeating a larger although not necessarily superior force but no one at the table could imagine how they might defeat galbatorix especially when eragon was still so powerless compared to the ancient king
the only ploy that might succeed would be to surround eragon with as many magicians dwarf and human as possible and then attempt to force galbatorix to confront them ** problem with that plan thought nasuada is that galbatorix overcame far more formidable enemies during his destruction of the riders and his strength has only grown since
she was certain that this had occurred to everyone else as ** we but had the elves spellweavers to swell our ranks then victory might be within our reach
without them
if we cannot overthrow galbatorix the only avenue left may be to flee alagaesia across the sundering sea and find a new land in which to build a life for ourselves
there we could wait until galbatorix is no more
even he cannot endure forever
the only certainty is that eventually all things shall pass
they moved on then from tactics to logistics and here the debate became far more acrimonious as the council of elders argued with orrin is advisers over the distribution of responsibilities between the varden and surda who should pay for this or that provide rations for laborers who worked for both groups manage the provisions for their respective warriors and how numerous other related subjects should be dealt with
