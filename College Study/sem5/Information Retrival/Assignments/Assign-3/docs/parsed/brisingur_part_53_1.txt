in as few words as possible eragon explained about solembum and the menoa tree
squatting next to the ore rhunon caressed the pitted surface her fingers lingering over the metallic patches interspersed among the stone
you were either very foolish or very brave to test the menoa tree as you did
she is not one to trifle with
is there enough ore for a sword saphira asked
several swords if past experience is anything to judge by said rhunon rising to her full height
the elf woman glanced at her forge in the center of the atrium then clapped her hands together her eyes lighting up with a combination of eagerness and determination
let us to it ** you need a sword shadeslayer very well i shall give you a sword the likes of which has never been seen before in alagaesia
but what of your oath eragon asked
think not of it for the time being
when must the two of you return to the varden
we should have left the day we arrived said eragon
rhunon paused her expression introspective
then i shall have to hurry that which i do not normally hurry and use magic to craft that which would otherwise require weeks of work by hand
you and brightscales will help ** it was not a question but eragon nodded in agreement
we shall not rest tonight but i promise you shade slayer you shall have your sword by tomorrow ** bending at the knees rhunon lifted the ore from the ground without discernible effort and carried it to the bench with her carving in progress
eragon removed his tunic and shirt so he would not ruin them during the work to come and in their place rhunon gave him a tight fitting jerkin and a fabric apron treated so that it was impervious to fire
rhunon wore the same
when eragon asked her about gloves she laughed and shook her head
only a clumsy smith uses gloves
then rhunon led him to a low grotto like chamber set within the trunk of one of the trees out of which her house was grown
inside the chamber were bags of charcoal and loose piles of whitish clay bricks
by means of a spell eragon and rhunon lifted several hundred bricks and carried them outside next to the open walled forge then did the same with the bags of charcoal each of which was as large as a man
once the supplies were arranged to rhunon is satisfaction she and eragon built a smelter for the ore
the smelter was a complex structure and rhunon refused to use much magic to construct it so the project took them most of the afternoon
first they dug a rectangular pit five feet deep which they filled with layers of sand gravel clay charcoal and ash and in which they embedded a number of chambers and channels to wick away moisture that would otherwise dampen the heat of the smelting fire
when the contents of the pit were level with the ground they assembled a trough of bricks on top of the layers below using water and unfired clay as their mortar
ducking inside her house rhunon returned with a pair of bellows which they attached to holes at the base of the trough
they broke then to drink and to eat a few bites of bread and cheese
after the brief repast rhunon placed a handful of small branches in the trough lit them on fire with a murmured word and when the flames were well set laid medium sized pieces of seasoned oak along the bottom
for nearly an hour she tended the fire cultivating it with the care of a gardener growing roses until the wood had burned down to an even bed of coals
then rhunon nodded to eragon and said now
eragon lifted the lump of ore and gently lowered it into the trough
when the heat on his fingers became unbearable he released the ore and jumped back as a fountain of sparks swirled upward like a swarm of fireflies
on top of the ore and the coals he shoveled a thick blanket of charcoal as fuel for the fire
eragon brushed the charcoal dust from his palms then grasped the handles of one set of bellows and began to pump it as did rhunon the bellows on the other side of the smelter
between them they supplied the fire with a steady stream of fresh air so that it burned ever hotter
the scales on saphira is chest as well as on the underside of her head and neck sparkled with dazzling flashes of light as the flames in the smelter danced
