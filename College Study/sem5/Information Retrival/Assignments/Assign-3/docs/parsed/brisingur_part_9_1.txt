fadawar a tall high nosed black skinned man spoke with the same heavy emphasis and altered vowels nasuada remembered hearing during her childhood in farthen dur when emissaries from her father is tribe would arrive and she would sit on ajihad is lap and doze while they talked and smoked cardus weed
nasuada gazed up at fadawar and wished she were six inches taller so that she could look the warlord and his four retainers straight in the eyes
still she was accustomed to men looming over her
she found it rather more disconcerting to be among a group of people who were as dark as she was
it was a novel experience not to be the object of people is curious stares and whispered comments
she was standing in front of the carved chair where she held her audiences one of the only solid chairs the varden had brought with them on their campaign inside her red command pavilion
the sun was close to setting and its rays filtered through the right side of the pavilion as through stained glass and gave the contents a ruddy glow
a long low table covered with scattered reports and maps occupied one half of the pavilion
just outside the entrance to the large tent she knew the six members of her personal guard two humans two dwarves and two urgals were waiting with drawn weapons ready to attack if they received the slightest indication she was in peril
jormundur her oldest and most trusted commander had saddled her with guards since the day ajihad died but never so many for so long
however the day after the battle on the burning plains jormundur expressed his deep and abiding concern for her safety a concern he said that often kept him up nights with a burning stomach
as an assassin had tried to kill her in aberon and murtagh had actually accomplished the deed in regard to king hrothgar less than a week past it was jormundur is opinion that nasuada ought to create a force dedicated to her own defense
she had objected that such a measure would be an overreaction but had been unable to convince jormundur he had threatened to abdicate his post if she refused to adopt what he considered to be proper precautions
eventually she acceded only to spend the next hour haggling over how many guards she was to have
he had wanted twelve or more at all times
she wanted four or fewer
they settled on six which still struck nasuada as too many she worried about appearing afraid or worse as if she were attempting to intimidate those she met
again her protestations had failed to sway jormundur
when she accused him of being a stubborn old worrywart he laughed and said better a stubborn old worrywart than a foolhardy youngling dead before his time
as the members of her guard changed every six hours the total number of warriors assigned to protect nasuada was four and thirty including the ten additional warriors who remained in readiness to replace their comrades in case of sickness injury or death
it was nasuada who had insisted upon recruiting the force from each of the three mortal races arrayed against galbatorix
by doing so she hoped to foster greater solidarity among them as well as to convey that she represented the interests of all the races under her command not just the humans
she would have included the elves as well but at the moment arya was the only elf who fought alongside the varden and their allies and the twelve spellcasters islanzadi had sent to protect eragon had yet to arrive
to nasuada is disappointment her human and dwarf guards had been hostile to the urgals they served with a reaction she anticipated but had been unable to avert or mitigate
it would she knew take more than one shared battle to ease the tensions between races that had fought and hated each other for more generations than she cared to count
still she viewed it as encouraging that the warriors chose to name their corps the nighthawks for the title was a play upon both her coloring and the fact that the urgals invariably referred to her as lady nightstalker
although she would never admit it to jormundur nasuada had quickly come to appreciate the increased sense of security her guards provided
