banning you from my presence was the greatest mistake i have ever made
can you forgive me
the gathered elves stirred with amazement
arya is response was long in coming but at last she said for seventy years i have lived and loved fought and killed without ever speaking to you my mother
our lives are long but even so that is no small span
islanzadi drew herself upright lifting her chin
a tremor ran her length
i cannot undo the past arya no matter how much i might desire to
and i cannot forget what i endured
nor should ** islanzadi clasped her daughter is hands
arya i love you
you are my only family
go if you must but unless you wish to renounce me i would be reconciled with you
for a terrible moment it seemed as if arya would not answer or worse would reject the offer
eragon saw her hesitate and quickly look at her audience
then she lowered her eyes and said no mother
i could not ** islanzadi smiled uncertainly and embraced her daughter again
this time arya returned the gesture and smiles broke out among the assembled elves
the white raven hopped on his stand cackling and on the door was graven evermore what now became the family lore let us never do but to **
hush blagden said islanzadi to the raven
keep your doggerel to ** breaking free the queen turned to eragon and saphira
you must excuse me for being discourteous and ignoring you our most important guests
eragon touched his lips and then twisted his right hand over his sternum as arya had taught him
islanzadi drottning
atra esterni ono ** he had no doubt that he was supposed to speak first
islanzadi is dark eyes widened
atra du evarinya ono varda
un atra mor ranr lifa unin hjarta onr replied eragon completing the ritual
he could tell that the elves were caught off guard by his knowledge of their customs
in his mind he listened as saphira repeated his greeting to the queen
when she finished islanzadi asked dragon what is your name
a flash of recognition appeared in the queen is expression but she made no comment on it
welcome to ellesmera saphira
and yours rider
eragon shadeslayer your ** this time an audible stir rippled among the elves seated behind them even islanzadi appeared startled
you carry a powerful name she said softly one that we rarely bestow upon our children
welcome to ellesmera eragon shadeslayer
we have waited long for ** she moved on to orik greeted him then returned to her throne and draped her velvet cloak over her arm
i assume by your presence here eragon so soon after saphira is egg was captured and by the ring on your hand and the sword on your hip that brom is dead and that your training with him was incomplete
i wish to hear your full story including how brom fell and how you came to meet my daughter or how she met you as it may be
then i will hear of your mission here dwarf and of your adventures arya since your ambush in du weldenvarden
eragon had narrated his experiences before so he had no trouble reiterating them now for the queen
the few occasions where his memory faltered saphira was able to provide an accurate description of events
in several places he simply left the telling to her
when they finished eragon retrieved nasuada is scroll from his pack and presented it to islanzadi
she took the roll of parchment broke the red wax seal and upon completing the missive sighed and briefly closed her eyes
i see now the true depth of my folly
my grief would have ended so much sooner if i had not withdrawn our warriors and ignored ajihad is messengers after learning that arya had been ambushed
i should have never blamed the varden for her death
for one so old i am still far too foolish
a long silence followed as no one dared to agree or disagree
summoning his courage eragon said since arya has returned alive will you agree to help the varden like before nasuada cannot succeed otherwise and i am pledged to her cause
my quarrel with the varden is as dust in the wind said islanzadi
fear not we will assist them as we once did and more because of you and their victory over the ** she leaned forward on one arm
