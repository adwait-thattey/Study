wild magic such as this is treacherous unpredictable and often stronger than any we can cast
eons ago all magic was thus
to use it required nothing but the ability to sense magic with your mind which every magician must possess and the desire and strength to use it
without the structure of the ancient language magicians could not govern their talent and as a result loosed many evils upon the land killing thousands
over time they discovered that stating their intentions in their language helped them to order their thoughts and avoid costly errors
but it was no foolproof method
eventually an accident occurred so horrific that it almost destroyed every living being in the world
we know of the event from fragments of manuscripts that survived the era but who or what cast the fatal spell is hidden from us
the manuscripts say that afterward a race called the grey folk not elves for we were young then gathered their resources and wrought an enchantment perhaps the greatest that was or ever shall be
together the grey folk changed the nature of magic itself
they made it so that their language the ancient language could control what a spell does
could actually limit the magic so that if you saidburn that door and by chance looked at me and thought of me the magic would still burn the door not me
and they gave the ancient language its two unique traits the ability to prevent those who speak it from lying and the ability to describe the true nature of things
how they did this remains a mystery
the manuscripts differ on what happened to the grey folk when they completed their work but it seems that the enchantment drained them of their power and left them but a shadow of themselves
they faded away choosing to live in their cities until the stones crumbled to dust or to take mates among the younger races and so pass into darkness
then said eragon it is still possible to use magic without the ancient language
how do you think saphira breathes fire and by your own account she used no word when she turned brom is tomb to diamond nor when she blessed the child in farthen dur
dragons minds are different from ours they need no protection from magic
they cannot use it consciously aside from their fire but when the gift touches them their strength is unparalleled
you look troubled eragon
why
eragon stared down at his hands
what does this mean for me master
it means that you will continue to study the ancient language for you can accomplish much with it that would be too complex or too dangerous otherwise
it means that if you are captured and gagged you can still call upon magic to free yourself as vanir did
it means that if you are captured and drugged and cannot recall the ancient language yes even then you may cast a spell though only in the gravest circumstances
and it means that if you would cast a spell for that which has no name in the ancient language you ** he paused
but beware the temptation to use these powers
even the wisest among us hesitate to trifle with them for fear of death or worse
the next morning and every morning thereafter so long as he stayed in ellesmera eragon dueled with vanir but he never lost his temper again no matter what the elf did or said
nor did eragon feel like devoting energy to their rivalry
his back pained him more and more frequently driving him to the limits of his endurance
the debilitating attacks sensitized him actions that previously had caused him no trouble could now leave him writhing on the ground
even the rimgar began to trigger the seizures as he advanced to more strenuous poses
it was not uncommon for him to suffer three or four such episodes in one day
eragon is face grew haggard
he walked with a shuffle his movements slow and careful as he tried to preserve his strength
it became hard for him to think clearly or to pay attention to oromis is lessons and gaps began to appear in his memory that he could not account for
in his spare time he took up orik is puzzle ring again preferring to concentrate upon the baffling interlocked rings rather than his condition
