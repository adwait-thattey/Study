the moment eragon climbed onto her she jumped out over the water
they soared upward circling over the lake but even at that height the opposing shore was not ** you like to take a bath eragon casually asked saphira
she grinned ** ** she locked her wings and sank to the waves clipping the crests with her claws
the water sparkled in the sunlight as they sailed over it
eragon whooped again
then saphira folded her wings and dived into the lake her head and neck entering it like a lance
the water hit eragon like an icy wall knocking out his breath and almost tearing him off saphira
he held on tightly as she swam to the surface
with three strokes of her feet she breached it and sent a burst of shimmering water toward the sky
eragon gasped and shook his hair as saphira slithered across the lake using her tail as a rudder
eragon nodded and took a deep breath tightening his arms
this time they slid gently under the water
they could see for yards through the unclouded liquid
saphira twisted and turned in fantastic shapes slipping through the water like an eel
eragon felt as if he were riding a sea serpent of legend
just as his lungs started to cry for air saphira arched her back and pointed her head upward
an explosion of droplets haloed them as she leapt into the air wings snapping open
with two powerful flaps she gained altitude
yes said saphira ** it is a pity you can not hold your breath longer
nothing i can do about that he said pressing water out of his hair
his clothes were drenched and the wind from saphira is wings chilled him
he pulled at his splint his wrist itched
once eragon was dry he and brom saddled the horses and started around leona lake in high spirits while saphira playfully dived in and out of the water
before dinner eragon blocked zar roc is edge in preparation for their usual sparring
neither he nor brom moved as they waited for the other to strike first
eragon inspected their surroundings for anything that might give him an advantage
a stick near the fire caught his attention
eragon swooped down grabbed the stick and hurled it at brom
the splint got in his way though and brom easily sidestepped the piece of wood
the old man rushed forward swinging his sword
eragon ducked just as the blade whistled over his head
he growled and tackled brom ferociously
they pitched to the ground each struggling to stay on top
eragon rolled to the side and swept zar roc over the ground at brom is shins
brom parried the blow with the hilt of his sword then jumped to his feet
twisting as he stood eragon attacked again guiding zar roc through a complex pattern
sparks danced from their blades as they struck again and again
brom blocked each blow his face tight with concentration
but eragon could tell that he was tiring
the relentless hammering continued as each sought an opening in the other is defenses
then eragon felt the battle change
blow by blow he gained advantage brom is parries slowed and he lost ground
eragon easily blocked a stab from brom
veins pulsed on the old man is forehead and cords bulged in his neck from the effort
suddenly confident eragon swung zar roc faster than ever weaving a web of steel around brom is sword
with a burst of speed he smashed the flat of his blade against brom is guard and knocked the sword to the ground
before brom could react eragon flicked zar roc up to his throat
they stood panting the red sword tip resting on brom is collarbone
eragon slowly lowered his arm and backed away
it was the first time he had bested brom without resorting to trickery
brom picked up his sword and sheathed it
still breathing hard he said we re done for today
but we just started said eragon startled
brom shook his head
i can teach you nothing more of the sword
of all the fighters i ve met only three of them could have defeated me like that and i doubt any of them could have done it with their left ** he smiled ruefully
i may not be as young as i used to be but i can tell that you re a talented and rare swordsman
does this mean we re not going to spar every night asked eragon
oh you re not getting out of it laughed brom
