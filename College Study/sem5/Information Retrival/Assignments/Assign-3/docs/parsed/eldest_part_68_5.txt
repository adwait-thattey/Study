it was late in the day and the garish orange of noon had subsided into a dusky gold light that suffused the camp and battlefield giving it a strange beauty
so now you know he said
do not say that growled eragon
do not ever say that
roran studied him for several seconds
you re right it was an ugly thought
i did not mean ** he scratched his beard and squinted at the bloated sun resting upon the horizon
nasuada was not what i expected
that forced a tired chuckle out of eragon
the one you were expecting was her father ajihad
still she is as good a leader as he was if not better
no that is the way she is
just then eragon felt jeod horst and a score of other men from carvahall hurrying toward them
the villagers slowed as they rounded a tent and glimpsed saphira
** exclaimed eragon
stepping forward he grasped the smith in a bear hug
it is good to see you **
horst gaped at eragon then a delighted grin spread across his face
blast if it is not good to see you as well eragon
you ve filled out since you left
you mean since i ran away
meeting the villagers was a strange experience for eragon
hardship had altered some of the men so much he barely recognized them
and they treated him differently than before with a mixture of awe and reverence
it reminded him of a dream where everything familiar is rendered alien
he was disconcerted by how out of place he felt among them
when eragon came to jeod he paused
you know about brom
ajihad sent me a message but i d like to hear what happened directly from you
eragon nodded grave
as soon as i have the chance we will sit down together and have a long talk
then jeod moved on to saphira and bowed to her
i waited my entire life to see a dragon and now i have seen two in the same day
i am indeed lucky
however you are the dragon i wanted to meet
bending her neck saphira touched jeod on the brow
he shivered at the ** him my thanks for helping to rescue me from galbatorix
otherwise i would still be languishing in the king is treasury
he was brom is friend and so he is our friend
after eragon repeated her words jeod said atra esterni ono thelduin saphira bjartskular surprising them with his knowledge of the ancient language
where did you go horst asked roran
we looked high and low for you after you took off in pursuit of those two magicians
never mind that now
return to the ship and have everyone disembark the varden are sending us food and shelter
we can sleep on solid ground ** the men cheered
eragon watched with interest as roran issued his commands
when at last jeod and the villagers departed eragon said they trust you
even horst obeys you without question
do you speak for all of carvahall now
heavy darkness was advancing upon the burning plains by the time they found the small two man tent the varden had assigned eragon
since saphira could not fit her head through the opening she curled up on the ground beside and prepared to keep watch
as soon as i get my strength back i will see to your wounds promised eragon
i know
do not stay up too late talking
inside the tent eragon found an oil lantern that he lit with steel and flint
he could see perfectly well without it but roran needed the light
they sat opposite each other eragon on the bedding laid out along one side of the tent roran on a folding stool he found leaning in a corner
eragon was uncertain how to begin so he remained silent and stared at the lamp is dancing flame
after uncounted minutes roran said tell me how my father died
our ** eragon remained calm as roran is expression hardened
in a gentle voice he said i have as much right to call him that as you
look within yourself you know it to be true
fine
our father how did he die
eragon had recounted the story upon several occasions
but this time he hid nothing
instead of just listing the events he described what he had thought and felt ever since he had found saphira is egg trying to make roran understandwhy he did what he did
he had never been so anxious before
i was wrong to hide saphira from the rest of the family eragon concluded but i was afraid you might insist on killing her and i did not realize how much danger she put us in
