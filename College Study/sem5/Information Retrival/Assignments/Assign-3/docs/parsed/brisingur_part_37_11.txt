so i call upon the meet to decide whether we are ready and we are more than ready in mine opinion to proceed to the final vote three days hence as is our law
my vote as i cast it is aye
freowin looked at hadfala who looked at gannel who looked at manndrath who tugged on his drooping nose and looked at nado sunk low in his chair and biting the inside of his cheek
aye said nado and so did the eight other clan chiefs
a satisfied expression on his face orik smiled as well and slapped his stomach
that i did
it was the only action i could take that would not inevitably lead to a clan war
we may still have a clan war but it shall not be of our making
i doubt such a calamity will come to pass though
as much as they hate you most of az sweldn rak anhuin will be appalled by what vermund has done in their name
he will not remain grimstborith for long i think
and now you have ensured that the vote for the new king
or queen shall take ** eragon hesitated reluctant to tarnish orik is enjoyment of his triumph but then he asked do you really have the support you need to win the throne
orik shrugged
before this morning no one had the support they needed
now the balance has shifted and for the time being sympathies lie with us
we might as well strike while the iron is hot we shall never have a better opportunity than this
in any case we cannot allow the clanmeet to drag on any longer
if you do not return to the varden soon all may be lost
what shall we do while we wait for the vote
first we shall celebrate our success with a feast orik declared
then when we are sated we shall continue as before attempting to gather additional votes while defending those we have already ** orik is teeth flashed white underneath the fringe of his beard as he smiled again
but before we consume so much as a single sip of mead there is something you must attend to which you have forgotten
what asked eragon puzzled by orik is obvious delight
why you must summon saphira to tronjheim of ** whether i become king or not we shall crown a new monarch in three days time
if saphira is to attend the ceremony she will need to fly quickly in order to arrive here before then
with a wordless exclamation eragon ran to find a mirror
