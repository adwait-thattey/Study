lifting his hammer roran handed it to edric
then he unbuckled his belt upon which hung his sword and his dagger and those too he surrendered to edric
i have no other weapons he said
edric nodded grim and slung the sword belt over one shoulder
roran stronghammer i hereby relieve you of command
have i your word of honor you will not attempt to flee
then you will make yourself useful where you may but in all else you will comport yourself as a ** edric looked around and pointed at another warrior
fuller you will assume roran is position until we return to the main body of the varden and nasuada can decide what is to be done about this
when they finished interring their casualties the varden retrieved their arrows then built a pyre in the center of the village stripped the soldiers of their gear dragged them onto the pile of wood and set it ablaze
the burning bodies filled the sky with a pillar of greasy black smoke that drifted upward for what seemed like miles
through it the sun appeared as a flat red disk
the young woman and the boy the soldiers had captured were nowhere to be found
since their bodies were not among the dead roran guessed the two had fled the village when the fighting broke out which he thought was probably the best thing they could have done
he wished them luck wherever they had gone
to roran is pleased surprise snowfire trotted back into the village minutes before the varden were to depart
at first the stallion was skittish and standoffish allowing no one to approach but by talking to him in a low voice roran managed to calm the stallion enough to clean and bandage the wounds in the horse is shoulder
since it would be unwise to ride snowfire until he was fully healed roran tied him to the front of the packhorses which the stallion took an immediate dislike to flattening his ears flicking his tail from side to side and curling his lips to bare his teeth
behave yourself said roran stroking his neck
snowfire rolled an eyeball at him and nickered his ears relaxing slightly
then roran pulled himself onto a gelding that had belonged to one of the dead varden and took his place at the rear of the line of men assembled between the houses
roran ignored the many glances they directed at him although it heartened him when several of the warriors murmured well done
as he sat waiting for edric to give the command to start forward roran thought of nasuada and katrina and eragon and a cloud of dread shadowed his thoughts as he wondered how they would react when they learned of his mutiny
roran pushed away his worries a second later
i did what was right and necessary he told himself
i wo not regret it no matter what may come of it
move on ** shouted edric from the head of the procession
roran spurred his steed into a brisk walk and as one he and the other men rode west away from the village leaving the pile of soldiers to burn itself to extinction
