eragon a fifteen year old farmboy is shocked when a polished blue stone appears before him in the range of mountains known as the spine
eragon takes the stone to the farm where he lives with his uncle garrow and his cousin roran
garrow and his late wife marian have raised eragon
nothing is known of his father his mother selena was garrow is sister and has not been seen since eragon is birth
later the stone cracks open and a baby dragon emerges
when eragon touches her a silvery mark appears on his palm and an irrevocable bond is forged between their minds making eragon one of the legendary dragon riders
the dragon riders were created thousands of years earlier in the aftermath of the elves great war with the dragons in order to ensure that hostilities would never again afflict their two races
the riders became peacekeepers educators healers natural philosophers and the greatest of spellweavers since being joined with a dragon makes one a magician
under their guidance and protection the land enjoyed a golden age
when humans arrived in alagaesia they too were added to this elite order
after many years of peace the monstrous and warlike urgals killed the dragon of a young human rider named galbatorix
driven mad by the loss and by his elders refusal to provide him with another dragon galbatorix set out to topple the riders
he stole another dragon whom he named shruikan and forced to serve him through certain black spells and gathered around himself a group of thirteen traitors the forsworn
with the help of those cruel disciples galbatorix threw down the riders killed their leader vrael and declared himself king over alagaesia
in this galbatorix was only partly successful for the elves and dwarves remain autonomous in their secret haunts and some humans have established an independent country surda in the south of alagaesia
a stalemate has existed between these factions for twenty years preceded by eighty years of open conflict brought about by the destruction of the riders
it is into this fragile political situation then that eragon is thrust
he fears he is in mortal danger it is common knowledge that galbatorix killed every rider who would not swear loyalty to him and so eragon hides the dragon from his family as he raises her
during this time eragon names the creature saphira after a dragon mentioned by the village storyteller brom
soon roran leaves the farm for a job that will allow him to earn enough money to marry katrina the butcher is daughter
when saphira stands taller than eragon two menacing beetle like strangers called the ra zac arrive in carvahall searching for the stone that was her egg
frightened saphira kidnaps eragon and flies into the spine
eragon manages to convince her to turn back but by then his home has been obliterated by the ra zac
eragon finds garrow in the wreckage tortured and badly wounded
garrow dies soon afterward and eragon vows to track down and kill the ra zac
eragon is accosted by brom who knows of saphira is existence and asks to accompany eragon for reasons of his own
after eragon agrees brom gives him the sword zar roc which was once a rider is blade though he refuses to say how he acquired it
eragon learns much from brom during their travels including how to fight with swords and use magic
eventually they lose the ra zac is trail and visit the city of teirm where brom believes his old friend jeod can help locate their lair
in teirm the eccentric herbalist angela tells eragon is fortune predicting mighty powers struggling to control his destiny an epic romance with one of noble birth the fact that he will one day leave alagaesia never to return and a betrayal from within his family
her companion the werecat solembum also gives him some words of advice
then eragon brom and saphira depart for dras leona where they hope to find the ra zac
brom finally reveals that he is an agent of the varden a rebel group dedicated to overthrowing galbatorix and that he had been hiding in eragon is village waiting for a new dragon rider to appear
