closing his eyes eragon turned his face toward the noonday sun and smiled up at the sky content
the weather was pleasant
the aroma of yeast flour roasting meat freshly poured wine boiling soups sweet pastries and melted candies suffused the clearing
his friends and family were gathered around him for celebration and not for mourning
and for the moment he was safe and saphira was safe
this is how life ought to be
a single horn rang out across the land unnaturally loud
everyone froze uncertain what the three notes signified
for a brief interval the entire camp was silent except for the animals then the varden is war drums began to beat
chaos erupted
mothers ran for their children and cooks dampened their fires while the rest of the men and women scrambled after their weapons
eragon sprinted toward saphira even as she surged to her feet
reaching out with his mind he found blodhgarm and once the elf lowered his defenses somewhat said meet us at the north entrance
eragon flung himself onto saphira
the instant he got a leg over her neck she jumped four rows of tents landed and then jumped a second time her wings half furled not flying but rather bounding through the camp like a mountain cat crossing a fast flowing river
the impact of each landing jarred eragon is teeth and spine and threatened to knock him off his perch
as they rose and fell frightened warriors dodging out of their path eragon contacted trianna and the other members of du vrangr gata identifying the location of each spellcaster and organizing them for battle
someone who was not of du vrangr gata touched his thoughts
he recoiled slamming walls up around his consciousness before he realized that it was angela the herbalist and allowed the contact
she said i am with nasuada and elva
nasuada wants you and saphira to meet her at the north entrance
as soon as we can
yes yes we re on our way
what of elva does she sense anything
pain
great pain
yours
the varden is
the others
i am sorry she is not very coherent right now
it is too much for her to cope with
i am going to put her to sleep until the violence is at an end
angela severed the connection
like a carpenter laying out and examining his tools before beginning a new project eragon reviewed the wards he had placed around himself saphira nasuada arya and roran
they all seemed to be in order
saphira slid to a stop before his tent furrowing the packed earth with her talons
he leaped off her back rolling as he struck the ground
bouncing upright he dashed inside undoing his sword belt as he went
he dropped the belt and the attached falchion into the dirt and scrabbling under his cot retrieved his armor
the cold heavy rings of the mail hauberk slid over his head and settled on his shoulders with a sound like falling coins
he tied on his arming cap placed the coif over it and then jammed his head into his helm
snatching up the belt he refastened it around his waist
with his greaves and his bracers in his left hand he hooked his little finger through the arm strap of his shield grabbed saphira is heavy saddle with his right hand and burst out of the tent
releasing his armor in a noisy clatter he threw the saddle onto the mound of saphira is shoulders and climbed after it
in his haste and excitement and his apprehension he had trouble buckling the straps
saphira shifted her stance
hurry
you re taking too long
** i am moving as fast as i ** it does not help you re so blasted **
the camp swarmed with activity men and dwarves streaming in jangling rivers toward the north rushing to answer the summons of the war drums
eragon collected his abandoned armor off the ground mounted saphira and settled into the saddle
with a flash of down swept wings a jolt of acceleration a blast of swirling air and the bitter complaint of bracers scraping against shield saphira took to the air
while they sped toward the northern edge of the camp eragon strapped the greaves to his shins holding himself on saphira merely with the strength of his legs
the bracers he wedged between his belly and the front of the saddle
