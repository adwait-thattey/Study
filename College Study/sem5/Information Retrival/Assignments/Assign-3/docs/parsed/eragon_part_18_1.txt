when eragon is eyes opened the memory of garrow is death crashed down on him
he pulled the blankets over his head and cried quietly under their warm darkness
it felt good just to lie there
to hide from the world outside
eventually the tears stopped
he cursed brom
then he reluctantly wiped his cheeks and got up
brom was making breakfast
good morning he said
eragon grunted in reply
he jammed his cold fingers in his armpits and crouched by the fire until the food was ready
they ate quickly trying to consume the food before it lost its warmth
when he finished eragon washed his bowl with snow then spread the stolen leather on the ground
what are you going to do with that asked brom
we can not carry it with us
i am going to make a saddle for saphira
mmm said brom moving forward
well dragons used to have two kinds of saddles
the first was hard and molded like a horse is saddle
but those take time and tools to make neither of which we have
the other was thin and lightly padded nothing more than an extra layer between the rider and dragon
those saddles were used whenever speed and flexibility were important though they were not nearly as comfortable as the molded ones
do you know what they looked like asked eragon
then please do said eragon standing aside
very well but pay attention
someday you may have to do this for ** with saphira is permission brom measured her neck and chest
then he cut five bands out of the leather and outlined a dozen or so shapes on the hides
once the pieces had been sliced out he cut what remained of the hides into long cords
brom used the cords to sew everything together but for each stitch two holes had to be bored through the leather
eragon helped with that
intricate knots were rigged in place of buckles and every strap was made extra long so the saddle would still fit saphira in the coming months
the main part of the saddle was assembled from three identical sections sewn together with padding between them
attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit snugly around one of saphira is neck spikes while wide bands sewn on either side would wrap around her belly and tie underneath
taking the place of stirrups were a series of loops running down both bands
tightened they would hold eragon is legs in place
a long strap was constructed to pass between saphira is front legs split in two and then come up behind her front legs to rejoin with the saddle
while brom worked eragon repaired his pack and organized their supplies
the day was spent by the time their tasks were completed
weary from his labor brom put the saddle on saphira and checked to see that the straps fit
he made a few small adjustments then took it off satisfied
you did a good job eragon acknowledged grudgingly
brom inclined his head
one tries his best
it should serve you well the leather is sturdy enough
are not you going to try it out asked saphira
maybe tomorrow said eragon storing the saddle with his ** is too late now
in truth he was not eager to fly again not after the disastrous outcome of his last attempt
dinner was made quickly
it tasted good even though it was simple
while they ate brom looked over the fire at eragon and asked will we leave tomorrow
there is not any reason to stay
i suppose not
he shifted
eragon i must apologize about how events have turned out
i never wished for this to happen
your family did not deserve such a tragedy
if there were anything i could do to reverse it i would
this is a terrible situation for all of ** eragon sat in silence avoiding brom is gaze then brom said we re going to need horses
maybe you do but i have saphira
brom shook his head
there is not a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon and saphira is too young to carry us both
besides it will be safer if we stay together and riding is faster than walking
but that will make it harder to catch the ra zac protested eragon
on saphira i could probably find them within a day or two
on horses it will take much longer if it is even possible to overtake their lead on the **
brom said slowly that is a chance you will have to take if i am to accompany you
