but if you had known me before gil ead if you had known me as i was you would not have considered me so aloof
then i could sing and dance and not feel threatened by a sense of impending doom
reaching out eragon placed his right hand over her left
the stories about the heroes of old never mention that this is the price you pay when you grapple with the monsters of the dark and the monsters of the mind
keep thinking about the gardens of tialdari hall and i am sure you will be fine
arya permitted the contact between them to endure for almost a minute a time not of heat or passion for eragon but rather of quiet companionship
he made no attempt to press his suit with her for he cherished her trust more than anything besides his bond with saphira and he would sooner march into battle than endanger it
then with a slight lift of her arm arya let him know the moment had passed and without complaint he withdrew his hand
eager to lighten her burden however he could eragon glanced about the ground nearest him and then murmured so softly as to be inaudible ** guided by the power of the true name he sifted through the earth by his feet until his fingers closed upon what he sought a thin papery disk half the size of his smallest fingernail
holding his breath he deposited it in his right palm centering it over his gedwey ignasia with as much delicacy as he could muster
he reviewed what oromis had taught him concerning the sort of spell he was about to cast to ensure he would not make a mistake and then he began to sing after the fashion of the elves smooth and flowing
again and again eragon repeated the same four lines directing them toward the brown flake in his hand
the flake trembled and then swelled and bulged becoming spherical
white tendrils an inch or two long sprouted from the bottom of the peeling globe tickling eragon while a thin green stem poked its way out of the tip and at his urging shot nearly a foot in the air
a single leaf broad and flat grew from the side of the stem
then the tip of the stem thickened drooped and after a moment of seeming inactivity split into five segments that expanded outward to reveal the waxy petals of a deep throated lily
the flower was pale blue and shaped like a bell
when it reached its full size eragon released the magic and examined his handiwork
singing plants into shape was a skill most every elf mastered at an early age but it was one eragon had practiced only a few times and he had been uncertain whether his efforts would meet with success
the spell had exacted a heavy toll from him the lily required a surprising amount of energy to feed what was the equivalent of a year and a half of growth
satisfied with what he had wrought he handed the lily to arya
it is not a white rose but
he smiled and shrugged
you should not have she said
but i am glad you ** she caressed the underside of the blossom and lifted it to smell
the lines on her face eased
for several minutes she admired the lily
then she scooped a hole in the soil next to her and planted the bulb pressing down the soil with the flat of her hand
she touched the petals again and kept glancing at the lily as she said thank you
giving flowers is a custom both our races share but we elves attach greater importance to the practice than do humans
it signifies all that is good life beauty rebirth friendship and more
i explain so you understand how much this means to me
you did not know but
arya regarded him with a solemn countenance as if to decide what he was about
forgive me
that is twice now i have forgotten the extent of your education
i shall not make the mistake again
she repeated her thanks in the ancient language and joining her in her native tongue eragon replied that it was his pleasure and he was happy she enjoyed his gift
he shivered hungry despite the meal they had just eaten
noticing arya said you used too much of your strength
if you have any energy left in aren use it to steady yourself
it took eragon a moment to remember that aren was the name of brom is ring he had heard it uttered only once before from islanzadi on the day he arrived in ellesmera
