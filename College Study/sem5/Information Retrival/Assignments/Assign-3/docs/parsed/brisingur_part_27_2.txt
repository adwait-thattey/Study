apace for them might mean months of deliberations
do not they realize the urgency of the situation
some do but many oppose helping us in this war and they seek to delay the proceedings as long as possible and to install one of their own upon the marble throne in tronjheim
the dwarves have lived in hiding for so long they have become dangerously suspicious of outsiders
if someone hostile to our aims wins the throne we shall lose the dwarves
we cannot allow that to happen
nor can we wait for the dwarves to resolve their differences at their usual pace
but she raised a finger from so far away i cannot effectively intervene in their politics
even if i were in tronjheim i could not ensure a favorable outcome the dwarves do not take kindly to anyone who is not of their clans meddling in their government
so i want you eragon to travel to tronjheim in my stead and do what you can to ensure that the dwarves choose a new monarch in an expeditious manner and that they choose a monarch who is sympathetic to our cause
king hrothgar adopted you into durgrimst ingeitum
according to their laws and customs you are a dwarf eragon
you have a legal right to participate in the hallmeets of the ingeitum and as orik is set to become their chief and as he is your foster brother and a friend of the varden is i am sure he will agree to let you accompany him into the secret councils of the thirteen clans where they elect their rulers
her proposal seemed preposterous to eragon
what about murtagh and thorn when they return as they surely will saphira and i are the only ones who can hold our own against them albeit with some assistance
if we are not here no one will be able to stop them from killing you or arya or orrin or the rest of the varden
the gap between nasuada is eyebrows narrowed
you dealt murtagh a stinging defeat yesterday
most likely he and thorn are winging their way back to uru baen even as we speak so galbatorix may interrogate them about the battle and chastise them for their failure
he will not send them to attack us again until he is confident that they can overwhelm you
murtagh is surely uncertain about the true limits of your strength now so that unhappy event may yet be some while off
between now and then i believe you will have enough time to travel back and forth between farthen dur
you could be wrong argued eragon
besides how would you keep galbatorix from learning about our absence and attacking while we are gone i doubt you have found all of the spies he has seeded among us
nasuada tapped her fingers on the arms of her chair
i said i wanted you to go to farthen dur eragon
i did not say i wanted saphira to go as ** turning her head saphira released a small puff of smoke that drifted toward the peak of the tent
he clamped shut his jaw and glared at her his left hand tight around the pommel of the falchion
you are not beholden to me saphira but my hope is that you will agree to stay here while eragon journeys to the dwarves so that we can deceive the empire and the varden as to eragon is whereabouts
if we can hide your departure she gestured at eragon from the masses no one will have any reason to suspect you are not still here
we will only have to devise a suitable excuse then to account for your sudden desire to remain in your tent during the day perhaps that you and saphira are flying sorties into enemy territory at night and so must rest while the sun is up
in order for the ruse to work however blodhgarm and his companions will have to stay here as well both to avoid arousing suspicion and for reasons of defense
if murtagh and thorn reappear while you are gone arya can take your place on saphira
between her blodhgarm is spellcasters and the magicians of du vrangr gata we should have a fair chance of thwarting murtagh
in a harsh voice eragon said if saphira does not fly me to farthen dur then how am i supposed to travel there in a timely fashion
by running
you told me yourself you ran much of the distance from helgrind
i expect that without having to hide from soldiers or peasants you can traverse many more leagues each day on the way to farthen dur than you were able to in the ** again nasuada drummed the polished wood of her chair
