at the carmine statue of morgothal the priest told how the brothers loved each other so much neither could exist independently
thus morgothal is burning palace in the sky during the day and the sparks from his forge that appeared overhead every night
and also thus how urur constantly fed his sibling so he would not die
only two more gods were left after that sindri mother of the earth and helzvog
helzvog is statue was different from the rest
the nude god was bowed in half over a dwarf sized lump of gray flint caressing it with the tip of his forefinger
the muscles of his back bunched and knotted with inhuman strain yet his expression was incredibly tender as if a newborn child lay before him
gannel is voice dropped to a low rasp guntera may be king of the gods but it is helzvog who holds our hearts
it was he who felt that the land should be peopled after the giants were vanquished
the other gods disagreed but helzvog ignored them and in secret formed the first dwarf from the roots of a mountain
when his deed was discovered jealousy swept the gods and guntera created elves to control alagaesia for himself
then sindri brought forth humans from the soil and urur and morgothal combined their knowledge and released dragons into the land
only kilf restrained herself
so the first races entered this world
eragon absorbed gannel is words accepting the clan chief is sincerity but unable to quell a simple question how does he know eragon sensed that it would be an awkward query however and merely nodded as he listened
this said gannel finishing the last of his ale leads to our most important rite which i know orik has discussed with you
all dwarves must be buried in stone else our spirits will never join helzvog in his hall
we are not of earth air or fire but ofstone
and as ingeitum it is your responsibility to assure a proper resting place for any dwarf who may die in your company
if you fail in the absence of injury or enemies hrothgar will exile you and no dwarf will acknowledge your presence until after your ** he straightened his shoulders staring hard at eragon
you have much more to learn yet uphold the customs i outlined today and you will do well
satisfied gannel led him away from the statues and up a winding staircase
as they climbed the clan chief dipped a hand into his robe and withdrew a simple necklace a chain threaded through the pommel of a miniature silver hammer
he gave it to eragon
this is another favor hrothgar asked of me gannel explained
he worries that galbatorix may have gleaned an image of you from the minds of durza the ra zac or any number of soldiers who saw you throughout the empire
because then galbatorix could scry you
perhaps he already has
a shiver of apprehension wormed down eragon is side like an icy ** should have thought of that he berated himself
the necklace will prevent anyone from scrying you or your dragon as long as you wear it
i placed the spell myself so it should hold before even the strongest mind
but be forewarned when activated the necklace will draw upon your strength until you either take it off or the danger has passed
what if i am asleep could the necklace consume all my energy before i was aware of it
eragon rolled the hammer between his fingers
it was difficult to avert another is spells least of all galbatorix ** gannel is so accomplished what other enchantments might be hidden in his gift he noticed a line of runes cut along the hammer is haft
they spelledastim hefthyn
the stairs ended as he asked why do dwarves write with the same runes as humans
for the first time since they met gannel laughed his voice booming through the temple as his large shoulders shook
it is the other way around humans write withour runes
when your ancestors landed in alagaesia they were as illiterate as rabbits
however they soon adopted our alphabet and matched it tothis language
some of your words even come from us likefather which was originallyfarthen
so then farthen dur means
eragon slipped the necklace over his head and tucked it under his tunic
