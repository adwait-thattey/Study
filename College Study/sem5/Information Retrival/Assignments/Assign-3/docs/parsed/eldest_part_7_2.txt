as he walked he continued to order his thoughts
after garrow is death roran had abandoned his job at dempton is mill in therinsford and returned to carvahall
horst had agreed to house him and in the following months had provided him with work in the forge
grief had delayed roran is decisions about the future until two days ago when he finally settled upon a course of action
he wanted to marry katrina the butcher is daughter
the reason he went to therinsford in the first place was to earn money to ensure a smooth beginning to their life together
but now without a farm a home or means to support her roran could not in good conscience ask for katrina is hand
his pride would not allow it
nor did roran think sloan her father would tolerate a suitor with such poor prospects
even under the best of circumstances roran had expected to have a hard time convincing sloan to give up katrina the two of them had never been friendly
and it was impossible for roran to wed katrina without her father is consent not unless they wished to divide her family anger the village by defying tradition and most likely start a blood feud with sloan
considering the situation it seemed to roran that the only option available to him was to rebuild his farm even if he had to raise the house and barn himself
it would be hard starting from nothing but once his position was secured he could approach sloan with his head held ** spring is the soonest we might talk thought roran grimacing
he knew katrina would wait for a time at least
he continued at a steady pace until evening when the village came into view
within the small huddle of buildings wash hung on lines strung from window to window
men filed back toward the houses from surrounding fields thick with winter wheat
behind carvahall the half mile high igualda falls gleamed in the sunset as it tumbled down the spine into the anora
the sight warmed roran because it was so ordinary
nothing was more comforting than having everything where it should be
leaving the road he made his way up the rise to where horst is house sat with a view of the spine
the door was already open
roran tromped inside following the sounds of conversation into the kitchen
horst was there leaning on the rough table pushed into one corner of the room his arms bare to the elbow
next to him was his wife elain who was nearly five months pregnant and smiling with quiet contentment
their sons albriech and baldor faced them
as roran entered albriech said
and i still had not left the forge ** thane swears he saw me but i was on the other side of town
what is going on asked roran slipping off his pack
elain exchanged a glance with horst
here let me get you something to ** she set bread and a bowl of cold stew before him
then she looked him in the eye as if searching for a particular expression
how was it
roran shrugged
all of the wood is either burnt or rotting nothing worth using
the well is still intact and that is something to be grateful for i suppose
i will have to cut timber for the house as soon as possible if i am going to have a roof over my head by planting season
now tell me what is happened
** exclaimed horst
there is been quite a row there has
thane is missing a scythe and he thinks albriech took it
he probably dropped it in the grass and forgot where he left it snorted albriech
roran bit into the bread
it does not make much sense accusing you
if you needed a scythe you could just forge one
i know said albriech dropping into a chair but instead of looking for his he starts grousing that he saw someone leaving his field and that it looked a bit like me
and since no one else looks like me i must have stolen the scythe
it was true that no one looked like him
albriech had inherited both his father is size and elain is honey blond hair which made him an oddity in carvahall where brown was the predominant hair color
in contrast baldor was both thinner and dark haired
i am sure it will turn up said baldor quietly
try not to get too angry over it in the meantime
as roran finished the last of the bread and started on the stew he asked horst do you need me for anything tomorrow
