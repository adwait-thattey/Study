as a dragon none are higher than you in our culture
not even the queen would claim authority over you
you may do and say as you wish
we do not expect dragons to be bound by our laws
next she showed eragon how to twist his right hand and place it over his sternum in a curious gesture
this she said you will use when you meet islanzadi
by it you indicate that you offer her your loyalty and obedience
is it binding like my oath of fealty to nasuada
no only a courtesy and a small one at that
eragon struggled to remember the sundry modes of address that arya instructed them in
the salutations varied from man to woman adults to children boys to girls as well as by rank and prestige
it was a daunting list but one that eragon knew he had to memorize perfectly
when he had absorbed all he could arya stood and dusted her hands
so long as you do not forget you will do well ** she turned to leave
wait said eragon
he reached out to stop her then snatched back his hand before she noticed his presumption
she looked over her shoulder with a query in her dark eyes and his stomach clenched as he tried to find a way to voice his thoughts
despite his best efforts he ended up just saying are you well arya
you ve seemed distracted and out of sorts ever since we left hedarth
as arya is face hardened into a blank mask he winced inwardly knowing that he had chosen the wrong approach although he could not fathom why the question should offend her
when we are in du weldenvarden she informed him i expect that you will not speak to me in such a familiar way unless you wish to cause ** she stalked away
we can not afford to have her angry with you
go apologize
his pride ** it is her fault not mine
go apologize eragon or i will fill your tent with ** was no idle threat
saphira thought for a second then told him what to do
without arguing he jumped to his feet and darted in front of arya forcing her to stop
she regarded him with a haughty expression
he touched his fingers to his lips and said arya svit kona using the honorific he had just learned for a woman of great wisdom
i spoke badly and for that i cry your pardon
saphira and i were concerned for your welfare
after all you ve done for us it seemed the least we could do was offer our help in return if you need it
finally arya relented and said your concern is appreciated
and i too spoke ** she looked down
in the dark the outline of her limbs and torso was painfully rigid
you ask what troubles me eragon do you truly wish to know then i will tell ** her voice was as soft as thistledown floating on the wind
i am afraid
dumbfounded eragon made no response and she stepped past leaving him alone in the night
