she swooped down and alighted on a knoll in the grasslands and sat there with her wings draped across the ground panting and trembling
we should stay here for the night eragon said
saphira you re in no condition to go on
let is make camp until you recover
who knows the wind might die down by evening
he heard the wet rasp of her tongue as she licked her chops and then the heave of her lungs as she resumed panting
no she said
on these plains it might blow for weeks or even months on end
we cannot wait for calm
i will not give up merely because i hurt eragon
too much is at stake
then let me give you energy from aren
there is more than enough in the ring to sustain you from here to du weldenvarden
no she repeated again
save aren for when we have no other recourse
i can rest and recover in the forest
aren however we may have need of at any moment you should not deplete it merely to ease my discomfort
i hate to see you in such pain though
a faint growl escaped her
my ancestors the wild dragons would not have shrunk from a puny breeze like this and neither will i
and with that she jumped back into the air carrying him with her as she drove herself into the gale
as the day was drawing to an end and the wind still howled around them pushing against saphira as if fate were determined to keep them from reaching du weldenvarden eragon thought of the dwarf woman glumra and of her faith in the dwarven gods and for the first time in his life he felt the desire to pray
withdrawing from his mental contact with saphira who was so tired and preoccupied she did not notice eragon whispered guntera king of the gods if you exist and if you can hear me and if you have the power then please still this wind
i know i am not a dwarf but king hrothgar adopted me into his clan and i think that gives me the right to pray to you
guntera please we have to get to du weldenvarden as fast as possible not only for the good of the varden but also for the good of your people the knurlan
please i beg of you still this wind
saphira cannot keep this up much ** then feeling slightly foolish eragon extended himself toward saphira is consciousness wincing in sympathy as he felt the burning within her muscles
late that night when all was cold and black the wind abated and thereafter only occasionally buffeted them with a gust
when morning came eragon looked down and saw the hard dry land of the hadarac desert
blast it he said for they had not come as far as he had hoped
we wo not make it to ellesmera today will we
not unless the wind decides to blow in the opposite direction and carry us there upon its back
saphira labored in silence for another few minutes then added however barring any other unpleasant surprises we should arrive at du weldenvarden by evening
they landed only twice that day
once while they were on the ground saphira devoured a brace of ducks that she caught and killed with a burst of fire but other than that she went without food
to save time eragon ate his own meals in the saddle
dusk had settled over the countryside by the time they arrived at the edge of du weldenvarden and saphira glided to a soft landing under the outstretched branches of a massive oak
she folded her wings and sat still for a while too tired to continue
her crimson tongue hung loose from her mouth
while she rested eragon listened to the rustle of leaves overhead and to the hoot of owls and the chirp of evening insects
when she was sufficiently recovered saphira walked forward and passed between two giant moss covered oak trees and so crossed into du weldenvarden on foot
the elves had made it impossible for anyone or anything to enter the forest by means of magic and since dragons did not rely upon their bodies alone to fly saphira could not enter while in the air else her wings would fail her and she would fall from the sky
that should be far enough saphira said stopping in a small meadow several hundred feet from the perimeter of the forest
eragon unbuckled the straps from around his legs and slid down saphira is side
he searched the meadow until he found a bare patch of earth
