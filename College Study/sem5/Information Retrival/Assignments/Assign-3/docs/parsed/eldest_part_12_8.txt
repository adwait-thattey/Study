** elves only concept of time is late and even later
have you dealt with them much asked eragon crouching
saphira watched with interest
the dwarf laughed suddenly
eta
only arya and then sporadically because she traveled so often
in seven decades i ve learned but one thing about her you can not rush an elf
trying is like hammering a file it might break but it will never bend
ah but stone will shift given enough ** orik sighed and shook his head
of all the races elves change the least which is one reason i am reluctant to go
but we will get to meet queen islanzadi and see ellesmera and who knows what else when was the last time a dwarf was invited into du weldenvarden
orik frowned at him
scenery means nothing
urgent tasks remain in tronjheim and our other cities yet i must tramp across alagaesia to exchange pleasantries and sit and grow fat as you are tutored
it could take **
**
still if that is what is required to defeat shades and the ra zac i will do it
saphira touched his mind i doubt nasuada will let us stay in ellesmera for more than a few months
with what she told us we will be needed fairly soon
at ** said orik pushing himself upright
approaching were nasuada slippers flashing beneath her dress like mice darting from a hole jormundur and arya who bore a pack like orik is
she wore the same black leather outfit eragon had first seen her in as well as her sword
at that moment it struck eragon that arya and nasuada might not approve of him joining the ingeitum
guilt and trepidation shot through him as he realized that it had been his duty to consult nasuada ** ** he cringed remembering how angry she had been after his first meeting with the council of elders
thus when nasuada stopped before him he averted his eyes ashamed
but she only said you ** her voice was gentle restrained
i wondered if you would
now once again all three races have a hold on you
the dwarves can claim your allegiance as a member of durgrimst ingeitum the elves will train and shape you and their influence may be the strongest for you and saphira are bound by their magic and you have sworn fealty to me a human
perhaps it is best that we share your ** she met his surprise with an odd smile then pressed a small bag of coins into his palm and stepped away
jormundur extended a hand which eragon shook feeling a bit dazed
have a good trip eragon
guard yourself well
come said arya gliding past them into the darkness of farthen dur
it is time to leave
aiedail has set and we have far to go
aye orik agreed
he pulled out a red lantern from the side of his pack
nasuada looked them over once more
very well
eragon and saphira you have the varden is blessings as well as mine
may your journey be safe
remember you carry the weight of our hopes and expectations so acquit yourselves honorably
we will do our best promised eragon
gripping snowfire is reins firmly he started after arya who was already several yards away
orik followed then saphira
as saphira passed nasuada eragon saw her pause and lightly lick nasuada on the cheek
then she lengthened her stride catching up with him
as they continued north along the road the gate behind them shrank smaller and smaller until it was reduced to a pinprick of light with two lonely silhouettes where nasuada and jormundur remained watching
when they finally reached farthen dur is base they found a pair of gigantic doors thirty feet tall open and waiting
three dwarf guards bowed and moved away from the aperture
through the doors was a tunnel of matching proportions lined with columns and lanterns for the first fifty feet
after that it was as empty and silent as a mausoleum
it looked exactly like farthen dur is western entrance but eragon knew that this tunnel was different
instead of burrowing through the mile thick base to emerge outside it proceeded underneath mountain after mountain all the way to the dwarf city tarnag
here is our path said orik lifting the lantern
he and arya crossed over the threshold but eragon held back suddenly uncertain
while he did not fear the dark neither did he welcome being surrounded by eternal night until they arrived at tarnag
