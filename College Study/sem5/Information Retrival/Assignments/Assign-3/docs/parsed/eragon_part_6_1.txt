the sun rose the next morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow
the air was fresh sweet and very cold
ice edged the streams and small pools were completely frozen over
after a breakfast of porridge eragon returned to the glen and examined the charred area
the morning light revealed no new details so he started for home
the rough game trail was faintly worn and in places nonexistent
because it had been forged by animals it often backtracked and took long detours
yet for all its flaws it was still the fastest way out of the mountains
the spine was one of the only places that king galbatorix could not call his own
stories were still told about how half his army disappeared after marching into its ancient forest
a cloud of misfortune and bad luck seemed to hang over it
though the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly few people could stay in the spine for long without suffering an accident
eragon was one of those few not through any particular gift it seemed to him but because of persistent vigilance and sharp reflexes
he had hiked in the mountains for years yet he was still wary of them
every time he thought they had surrendered their secrets something happened to upset his understanding of them like the stone is appearance
he kept up a brisk pace and the leagues steadily disappeared
in late evening he arrived at the edge of a precipitous ravine
the anora river rushed by far below heading to palancar valley
gorged with hundreds of tiny streams the river was a brute force battling against the rocks and boulders that barred its way
a low rumble filled the air
he camped in a thicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed
it grew colder over the next day and a half
eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the wary wildlife
a bit past noon he heard the igualda falls blanketing everything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes
the trail led him onto a moist slate outcropping which the river sped past flinging itself into empty air and down mossy cliffs
before him lay palancar valley exposed like an unrolled map
the base of the igualda falls more than a half mile below was the northernmost point of the valley
a little ways from the falls was carvahall a cluster of brown buildings
white smoke rose from the chimneys defiant of the wilderness around it
at this height farms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger
the land around them was tan or sandy where dead grass swayed in the wind
the anora river wound from the falls toward palancar is southern end reflecting great strips of sunlight
far in the distance it flowed past the village therinsford and the lonely mountain utgard
beyond that he knew only that it turned north and ran to the sea
after a pause eragon left the outcropping and started down the trail grimacing at the descent
when he arrived at the bottom soft dusk was creeping over everything blurring colors and shapes into gray masses
carvahall is lights shimmered nearby in the twilight the houses cast long shadows
aside from therinsford carvahall was the only village in palancar valley
the settlement was secluded and surrounded by harsh beautiful land
few traveled here except merchants and trappers
the village was composed of stout log buildings with low roofs some thatched others shingled
smoke billowed from the chimneys giving the air a woody smell
the buildings had wide porches where people gathered to talk and conduct business
occasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit
eragon heard men talking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands scolding them for being late
eragon wove his way between the houses to the butcher is shop a broad thick beamed building
overhead the chimney belched black smoke
he pushed the door open
the spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a stone fireplace
a bare counter stretched across the far side of the room
the floor was strewn with loose straw
everything was scrupulously clean as if the owner spent his leisure time digging in obscure crannies for minuscule pieces of filth
