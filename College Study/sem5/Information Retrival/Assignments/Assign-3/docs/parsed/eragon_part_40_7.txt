he closed his eyes selected the words he needed stared at the mist and then commanded gath un reisa du **
there was a disturbance below
from above it looked as if the ground was flowing together like a great sluggish river
a leaden band of mist gathered in front of the urgals and thickened into an intimidating wall dark as a thunderhead
the urgals hesitated before it then continued forward like an unstoppable battering ram
the barrier swirled around them concealing the lead ranks from view
the drain on eragon is strength was sudden and massive making his heart flutter like a dying bird
he gasped eyes rolling
he struggled to sever the magic is hold on him to plug the breach through which his life streamed
with a savage growl he jerked away from the magic and broke contact
tendrils of magic snapped through his mind like decapitated snakes then reluctantly retreated from his consciousness clutching at the dregs of his strength
the wall of mist dissipated and the fog sluggishly collapsed across the ground like a tower of mud sliding apart
the urgals had not been hindered at all
eragon lay limply on saphira panting
only now did he remember brom saying magic is affected by distance just like an arrow or a spear
if you try to lift or move something a mile away it will take more energy than if you were ** i wo not forget that again he thought grimly
you should not have forgotten in the first place saphira inserted ** the dirt at gil ead and now this
were not you paying attention to anything brom told you you will kill yourself if you keep this up
i paid attention he insisted rubbing his chin
it is just been a while and i have not had an opportunity to think back on it
i ve never used magic at a distance so how could i know it would be so difficult
she ** thing i know you will be trying to bring corpses back to life
do not forget what brom said about that too
i wo not he said impatiently
saphira dipped toward the ground searching for murtagh and the horses
eragon would have helped her but he barely had the energy to sit up
saphira settled in a small field with a jolt and eragon was puzzled to see the horses stopped and murtagh kneeling examining the ground
when eragon did not dismount murtagh hurried over and inquired what is wrong he sounded angry worried and tired at the same time
i made a mistake said eragon truthfully
the urgals have entered the valley
i tried to confuse them but i forgot one of the rules of magic and it cost me a great deal
scowling murtagh jerked his thumb over his shoulder
i just found some wolf tracks but the footprints are as wide as both of my hands and an inch deep
there are animals around here that could be dangerous even to you ** he turned to her
i know you can not enter the forest but could you circle above me and the horses that should keep these beasts away
otherwise there may only be enough left of me to roast in a thimble
humor murtagh asked eragon a quick smile coming to his face
his muscles trembled making it hard for him to concentrate
only on the ** murtagh rubbed his eyes
i can not believe that the same urgals have been following us the whole time
they would have to be birds to catch up with us
saphira said they re larger than any we ve seen remarked eragon
murtagh cursed clenching the pommel of his sword
that explains ** saphira if you re right then those are kull elite of the urgals
i should have guessed that the chieftain had been put in charge of them
they do not ride because horses can not carry their weight not one of them is under eight feet tall and they can run for days without sleep and still be ready for battle
it can take five men to kill one
kull never leave their caves except for war so they must expect a great slaughter if they are out in such force
can we stay ahead of them
who knows said murtagh
they re strong determined and large in numbers
it is possible that we may have to face them
if that happens i only hope that the varden have men posted nearby who will help us
despite our skill and saphira we can not hold off kull
eragon swayed
