you will enjoy it
there is much you can learn from books and scrolls said jeod
he gestured at the walls
these books are my friends my companions
they make me laugh and cry and find meaning in life
always the scholar are not you asked brom
jeod shrugged
not anymore
i am afraid i ve degenerated into a bibliophile
one who loves books explained jeod and resumed conversing with brom
bored eragon scanned the shelves
an elegant book set with gold studs caught his attention
he pulled it off the shelf and stared at it curiously
it was bound in black leather carved with mysterious runes
eragon ran his fingers over the cover and savored its cool smoothness
the letters inside were printed with a reddish glossy ink
he let the pages slip past his fingers
a column of script set off from the regular lettering caught his eye
the words were long and flowing full of graceful lines and sharp points
eragon took the book to brom
what is this he asked pointing to the strange writing
brom looked at the page closely and raised his eyebrows in surprise
jeod you ve expanded your collection
where did you get this i have not seen one in ages
jeod strained his neck to see the book
ah yes thedomia abr wyrda
a man came through here a few years ago and tried to sell it to a trader down by the wharves
fortunately i happened to be there and was able to save the book along with his neck
he did not have a clue what it was
it is odd eragon that you should pick up this book thedominance of fate said brom
of all the items in this house it is probably worth the most
it details a complete history of alagaesia starting long before the elves landed here and ending a few decades ago
the book is very rare and is the best of its kind
when it was written the empire decried it as blasphemy and burned the author heslant the monk
i did not think any copies still existed
the lettering you asked about is from the ancient language
what does it say asked eragon
it took brom a moment to read the writing
it is part of an elven poem that tells of the years they fought the dragons
this excerpt describes one of their kings ceranthor as he rides into battle
the elves love this poem and tell it regularly though you need three days to do it properly so that they wo not repeat the mistakes of the past
at times they sing it so beautifully it seems the very rocks will cry
eragon returned to his chair holding the book ** is amazing that a man who is dead can talk to people through these pages
as long as this book survives his ideas live
i wonder if it contains any information about the ra zac
he browsed through the book while brom and jeod spoke
hours passed and eragon began to drowse
out of pity for his exhaustion jeod bid them good night
the butler will show you to your rooms
on the way upstairs the servant said if you need assistance use the bellpull next to the ** he stopped before a cluster of three doors bowed then backed away
as brom entered the room on the right eragon asked can i talk to you
you just did but come in anyway
eragon closed the door behind himself
saphira and i had an idea
is there
brom stopped him with a raised hand and pulled the curtains shut over the window
when you talk of such things you would do well to make sure that no unwelcome ears are present
sorry said eragon berating himself for the slip
anyway is it possible to conjure up an image of something that you can not see
brom sat on the edge of his bed
what you are talking about is called scrying
it is quite possible and extremely helpful in some situations but it has a major drawback
you can only observe people places and things that you ve already seen
if you were to scry the ra zac you d see them all right but not their surroundings
there are other problems as well
let is say that you wanted to view a page in a book one that you d already seen
you could only see the page if the book were open to it
if the book were closed when you tried this the page would appear completely black
why can not you view objects that you have not seen asked eragon
even with those limitations he realized scrying could be very ** wonder if i could view something leagues away and use magic to affect what was happening there
