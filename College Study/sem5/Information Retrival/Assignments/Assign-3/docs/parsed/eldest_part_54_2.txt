you ve become quite friendly with the sailors as of late
they re not our enemies objected mandel
everyone is an enemy at this point
clovis and his men could turn on us in an instant
it would not be a problem though if being with them had not caused you to neglect your ** mandel stiffened and color bloomed in his cheeks but he did not lower himself in roran is esteem by denying the charge
pleased roran asked what is the most important thing we can do right now mandel
mandel hesitated uncertain then confessed i do not know
help one another
it is the only way any of us are going to survive
i was especially disappointed to learn that you ve gambled food with the sailors since that endangers the entire village
your time would be far better spent hunting than playing games of dice or learning to throw knives
with your father gone it is fallen uponyou to care for your mother and siblings
they rely on you
am i clear
very clear sir replied mandel with a choked voice
good
now i did not bring you here just to chastise you
you show promise which is why i am giving you a task that i would trust to no one else but myself
tomorrow morning i need you to return to camp and deliver a message to horst
jeod believes the empire has spies watching this house so it is vital that you make sure you are not followed
wait until you re out of the city then lose whoever is trailing you in the countryside
kill him if you have to
when you find horst tell him to
as roran outlined his instructions he watched mandel is expression change from surprise to shock and then to awe
what if clovis objects asked mandel
that night break the tillers on the barges so they can not be steered
it is a dirty trick but it could be disastrous if clovis or any of his men arrive at teirm before you
i wo not let that happen vowed mandel
roran smiled
** satisfied that he had resolved the matter of mandel is behavior and that the young man would do everything possible to get the message to horst roran went back inside and bade their host good night before heading off to sleep
with the exception of mandel roran and his companions confined themselves to the mansion throughout the following day taking advantage of the delay to rest hone their weapons and review their stratagems
from dawn till dusk they saw some of helen as she bustled from one room to the next more of rolf with his teeth like varnished pearls and none of jeod for the gray pated merchant had left to walk the city and seemingly by accident meet with the few men of the sea whom he trusted for their expedition
upon his return he told roran we can count on five more hands
i only hope it is ** jeod remained in his study for the rest of the evening drawing up various legal documents and otherwise tending to his affairs
three hours before dawn roran loring birgit gertrude and nolfavrell roused themselves and fighting back prodigious yawns congregated in the mansion is entryway where they muffled themselves in long cloaks to obscure their faces
a rapier hung at jeod is side when he joined them and roran thought the narrow sword somehow completed the rangy man as if it reminded jeod who he really was
jeod lit an oil lantern and held it up before them
are we ready he asked
they nodded
then jeod unlatched the door and they filed outside to the empty cobblestone street
behind them jeod lingered in the entryway casting a longing gaze toward the stairs on the right but helen did not appear
with a shudder jeod left his home and closed the door
roran put a hand on his arm
what is done is done
they trotted through the dark city slowing to a quick walk whenever they encountered watchmen or a fellow creature of the night most of whom darted away at the sight of them
once they heard footsteps on top of a nearby building
the design of the city explained jeod makes it easy for thieves to climb from one roof to another
they slowed to a walk again when they arrived at teirm is eastern gate
because the gate opened to the harbor it was closed only four hours each night in order to minimize the disruption to commerce
