roran gripped the hammer at his belt as they approached narda is gate
two soldiers guarded the opening
they examined roran is group with hard eyes lingering on their ragged clothes then lowered their poleaxes and barred the entrance
where d you be from asked the man on the right
he could not have been older than twenty five but his hair was already pure white
swelling his chest horst crossed his arms and said roundabouts teirm if it please you
trade
we were sent by shopkeepers who want to buy goods directly from narda instead of through the usual merchants
when horst faltered gertrude said herbs and medicine on my part
the plants i ve received from here have either been too old or moldy and spoiled
i have to procure a fresh supply
and my brothers and i said darmmen came to bargain with your cobblers
shoes made in the northern style are fashionable in dras leona and uru ** he grimaced
at least they were when we set out
horst nodded with renewed confidence
aye
and i am here to collect a shipment of ironwork for my master
so you say
what about that one what does he do asked the soldier motioning toward roran with his ax
how do you think the glaze on a bottle or jar gets cracked it does not happen by itself you know
you have to hit ** roran returned the white haired man is stare of disbelief with a blank expression daring him to challenge the statement
the soldier grunted and ran his gaze over them again
be as that may you do not look like tradesmen to me
starved alley cats is more like it
we had difficulty on the road said gertrude
that i d believe
if you came from teirm where be your horses
we left them at our camp supplied hamund
he pointed south opposite where the rest of the villagers were actually hidden
do not have the coin to stay in town eh with a scornful chuckle the soldier raised his ax and gestured for his companion to do likewise
all right you can pass but do not cause trouble or you will be off to the stocks or worse
once through the gate horst pulled roran to the side of the street and growled in his ear that was a fool thing to do making up something as ridiculous as that
cracking the ** do youwant a fight we can not he stopped as gertrude plucked at his sleeve
to the left of the entrance stood a six foot wide message board with a narrow shingle roof to protect the yellowing parchment underneath
half the board was devoted to official notices and proclamations
on the other half hung a block of posters displaying sketches of various criminals
foremost among them was a drawing of roran without a beard
startled roran glanced around to make sure that no one in the street was close enough to compare his face to the illustration then devoted his attention to the poster
he had expected the empire to pursue them but it was still a shock to encounter proof of ** must be expending an enormous amount of resources trying to catch us
when they were in the spine it was easy to forget that the outside world ** bet posters of me are nailed up throughout the empire
he grinned glad that he had stopped shaving and that he and the others had agreed to use false names while in narda
a reward was inked at the bottom of the poster
garrow never taught roran and eragon to read but he did teach them their figures because as he said you have to know how much you own what it is worth and what you re paid for it so you do not get rooked by some two faced ** thus roran could see that the empire had offered ten thousand crowns for him enough to live in comfort for several decades
in a perverse way the size of the reward pleased him giving him a sense of importance
then his gaze drifted to the next poster in line
roran is gut clenched as if he had been struck and for a few seconds he forgot to breathe
after his initial relief subsided roran felt his old anger about eragon is role in garrow is death and the destruction of their farm take its place accompanied by a burning desire to know why the empire was hunting ** must have something to do with that blue stone and the ra zac is first visit to carvahall
