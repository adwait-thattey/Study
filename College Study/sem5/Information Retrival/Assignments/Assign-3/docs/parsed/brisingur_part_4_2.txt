it was not murtagh is fault that the twins had abducted him that the red dragon thorn had hatched for him or that galbatorix had discovered their true names with which he extracted oaths of fealty in the ancient language from both murtagh and thorn
none of that could be blamed on murtagh
he was a victim of fate and had been since the day he was born
and yet
murtagh might serve galbatorix against his will and he might abhor the atrocities the king forced him to commit but some part of him seemed to revel in wielding his newfound power
during the recent engagement between the varden and the empire on the burning plains murtagh had singled out the dwarf king hrothgar and slain him although galbatorix had not ordered murtagh to do so
he had let eragon and saphira go yes but only after defeating them in a brutal contest of strength and then listening to eragon plead for their freedom
and murtagh had derived entirely too much pleasure from the anguish he inflicted upon eragon by revealing they were both sons of morzan first and last of the thirteen dragon riders the forsworn who had betrayed their compatriots to galbatorix
now four days after the battle another explanation presented itself to eragon perhaps what murtagh enjoyed was watching another person shoulder the same terrible burden he had carried his whole life
whether or not that was true eragon suspected murtagh had embraced his new role for the same reason that a dog who has been whipped without cause will someday turn and attack his master
murtagh had been whipped and whipped and now he had his chance to strike back at a world that had shown him little enough kindness
yet no matter what good might still flicker in murtagh is breast he and eragon were doomed to be mortal enemies for murtagh is promises in the ancient language bound him to galbatorix with unbreakable fetters and would forevermore
if only he had not gone with ajihad to hunt urgals underneath farthen dur
or if i had just been a little faster the twins eragon said saphira
he caught himself and nodded grateful for her intervention
eragon did his best to avoid brooding upon murtagh or their shared parents but such thoughts often waylaid him when he least expected it
drawing and releasing a slow breath to clear his head eragon tried to force his mind back to the present but could not
the morning after the massive battle on the burning plains when the varden were busy regrouping and preparing to march after the empire is army which had retreated several leagues up the jiet river eragon had gone to nasuada and arya explained roran is predicament and sought their permission to help his cousin
he did not succeed
both women vehemently opposed what nasuada described as a harebrained scheme that will have catastrophic consequences for everyone in alagaesia if it goes **
the debate raged on for so long at last saphira had interrupted with a roar that shook the walls of the command tent
then she said i am sore and tired and eragon is doing a poor job of explaining himself
we have better things to do than stand around yammering like jackdaws no
good now listen to me
it was reflected eragon difficult to argue with a dragon
the details of saphira is remarks were complex but the underlying structure of her presentation was straightforward
saphira supported eragon because she understood how much the proposed mission meant to him while eragon supported roran because of love and family and because he knew roran would pursue katrina with or without him and his cousin would never be able to defeat the ra zac by himself
also so long as the empire held katrina captive roran and through him eragon was vulnerable to manipulation by galbatorix
if the usurper threatened to kill katrina roran would have no choice but to submit to his demands
it would be best then to patch this breach in their defenses before their enemies took advantage of it
as for the timing it was perfect
neither galbatorix nor the ra zac would expect a raid in the center of the empire when the varden were busy fighting galbatorix is troops near the border of surda
