night had fallen on the burning plains
the roof of opaque smoke covered the moon and stars plunging the land into profound darkness that was broken only by the sullen glow of the sporadic peat fires and by the thousands of torches each army lit
from eragon is position near the fore of the varden the empire looked a dense nest of uncertain orange lights as large as any city
as eragon buckled the last piece of saphira is armor onto her tail he closed his eyes to maintain better contact with the magicians from du vrangr gata
he had to learn to locate them at a moment is notice his life would depend on communicating with them in a quick and timely manner
in turn the magicians had to learn to recognize the touch of his mind so they did not block him when he needed their assistance
eragon smiled and said hello ** he opened his eyes to see orik clambering up the low knuckle of rock where he and saphira sat
the dwarf who was fully armored carried his urgal horn bow in his left hand
hunkering beside eragon orik wiped his brow and shook his head
how d you know it was me i was shielding myself
every consciousness feels different explained ** like no two voices sound exactly the same
eragon asked what brings you here
orik shrugged
it struck me you might appreciate a spot of company in this grim night
especially since arya is otherwise engaged and you do not have murtagh with you for this battle
and i wish i did thought eragon
murtagh had been the only human who matched eragon is skill with a sword at least before the agaeti blodhren
sparring with him had been one of eragon is few pleasures during their time ** would have enjoyed fighting with you again old friend
remembering how murtagh was killed dragged underground by urgals in farthen dur forced eragon to confront a sobering truth no matter how great a warrior you were as often as not pure chance dictated who lived and who died in war
orik must have sensed his mood for he clapped eragon on the shoulder and said you will be fine
just imagine how the soldiers out there feel knowing they have to faceyou before **
gratitude made eragon smile again
i am glad you came
the tip of orik is nose reddened and he glanced down rolling his bow between gnarled hands
ah well he grumbled hrothgar would not much like it if i let something happen to you
besides we re foster brothers now eh
through eragon saphira asked what about the other dwarves are not they under your command
a twinkle sprang into orik is eyes
why yes so they are
and they will be joining us before long
seeing as eragon is a member of durgrimst ingeitum it is only right we fight the empire together
that way the two of you wo not be so vulnerable you can concentrate on finding galbatorix is magicians instead of defending yourselves from constant attacks
a good idea
thank ** orik grunted an acknowledgment
then eragon asked what do you think about nasuada and the urgals
i do
i do not like it any more than you but i do
silence enveloped them after that
eragon sat against saphira and stared out at the empire trying to prevent his growing anxiety from overwhelming him
minutes dragged by
to him the interminable waiting before a battle was as stressful as the actual fighting
he oiled saphira is saddle polished rust off his hauberk and then resumed familiarizing himself with the minds of du vrangr gata anything to pass the time
over an hour later he paused as he sensed two beings approaching from across the no man is ** solembum puzzled and alarmed he woke orik who had dozed off and told him what he had discovered
the dwarf frowned and drew his war ax from his belt
i ve only met the herbalist a few times but she did not seem like the sort who would betray us
she is been welcome among the varden for decades
we should still find out what she was doing said eragon
together they picked their way through the camp to intercept the duo as they approached the fortifications
angela soon trotted into the light solembum at her heels
the witch was muffled in a dark full length cloak that allowed her to blend into the mottled landscape
