the chamber had no ceiling but ascended all the way to the top of tronjheim a mile overhead
there it opened to the dragonhold where eragon and saphira had resided before arya broke the star sapphire and then to the sky beyond a rich blue disk that seemed unimaginably distant ringed as it was by the open mouth of farthen dur the hollow ten mile high mountain that sheltered tronjheim from the rest of the world
only a scant amount of daylight filtered down to the base of tronjheim
the city of eternal twilight the elves called it
since so little of the sun is radiance entered the city mountain except for a dazzling half hour before and after noon during the height of summer the dwarves illuminated the interior with uncounted numbers of their flameless lanterns
thousands of them were on glorious display in the chamber
a bright lantern hung from the outside of every other pillar of the curved arcades that lined each level of the city mountain and even more lanterns were mounted within the arcades marking the entrances to strange and unknown rooms as well as the path of vol turin the endless staircase which spiraled around the chamber from top to bottom
the effect was both moody and spectacular
the lanterns were of many different colors making it appear as if the interior of the chamber were dotted with glowing jewels
their glory however paled beside the splendor of a real jewel the greatest jewel of them all isidar mithrim
on the floor of the chamber the dwarves had built a wooden scaffold sixty feet in diameter and within the enclosure of fitted oak beams they were piece by precious piece reassembling the shattered star sapphire with the utmost care and delicacy
the shards they had yet to place they had stored in open topped boxes padded with nests of raw wool each box labeled with a line of spidery runes
the boxes were spread out across a large portion of the western side of the vast room
perhaps three hundred dwarves sat hunched over them intent on their work as they strove to fit the shards together into a cohesive whole
another group bustled about the scaffolding tending to the fragmented gem within as well as building additional structures
eragon watched them at their labor for several minutes then wandered over to the section of the floor durza had broken when he and his urgal warriors had entered tronjheim from the tunnels below
with the tip of his boot eragon tapped the polished stone in front of him
no trace of the damage durza had wrought remained
the dwarves had done a marvelous job of erasing the marks left by the battle of farthen dur although eragon hoped they would commemorate the battle with a memorial of some sort for he felt it was important that future generations not forget the cost in blood the dwarves and the varden had paid during the course of their struggle against galbatorix
as eragon walked toward the scaffolding he nodded at skeg who was standing on a platform overlooking the star sapphire
eragon had met the thin quick fingered dwarf before
skeg was of durgrimst gedthrall and it was to him king hrothgar had entrusted the restoration of the dwarves most valuable treasure
skeg gestured for eragon to climb up onto the platform
a sparkling vista of slanting needle sharp spires glittering paperthin edges and rippling surfaces confronted eragon as he heaved himself onto the rough hewn planks
the top of the star sapphire reminded him of the ice on the anora river in palancar valley at the end of winter when the ice had melted and refrozen multiple times and was treacherous to walk over on account of the bumps and ridges the swings in temperature had cast up
only instead of blue white or clear the remnants of the star sapphire were a soft rosy pink shot through with traces of dusky orange
skeg shrugged and fluttered his hands in the air like a pair of butterflies
it goes as it does argetlam
you cannot hurry perfection
it looks to me as if you are making quick progress
with a bony forefinger skeg tapped the side of his broad flat nose
the top of isidar mithrim what is now the bottom arya broke it into large pieces which are easy to fit together
