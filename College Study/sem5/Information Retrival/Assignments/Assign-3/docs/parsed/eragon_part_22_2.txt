his thoughts turned to how he had killed the urgals
an idea a revelation slowly wormed its way through his mind
he eragon farm boy of palancar valley had used ** it was the only word for what had happened
it seemed impossible but he could not deny what he had ** i ve become a sorcerer or ** but he did not know how to use this new power again or what its limits and dangers might ** can i have this ability was it common among the riders and if brom knew of it why did not he tell me he shook his head in wonder and bewilderment
he conversed with saphira to check on brom is condition and to share his thoughts
she was just as puzzled as he was about the ** can you find us a place to stay i can not see very far down here
while she searched he continued along the ninor
the summons reached him just as the light was **
saphira sent him an image of a secluded clearing in the trees by the river
eragon turned the horses in the new direction and nudged them into a trot
with saphira is help it was easy to find but it was so well hidden that he doubted anyone else would notice it
a small smokeless fire was already burning when he entered the clearing
brom sat next to it tending his arm which he held at an awkward angle
saphira was crouched beside him her body tense
she looked intently at eragon and asked are you sure you are not hurt
not on the outside
but i am not sure about the rest of me
i should have been there sooner
do not feel bad
we all made mistakes today
mine was not staying closer to ** gratitude for that remark washed over him
he looked at brom
how are you
the old man glanced at his arm
it is a large scratch and hurts terribly but it should heal quickly enough
i need a fresh bandage this one did not last as long as i d ** they boiled water to wash brom is wound
then brom tied a fresh rag to his arm and said i must eat and you look hungry as well
let is have dinner first then talk
when their bellies were full and warm brom lit his pipe
now i think it is time for you to tell me what transpired while i was unconscious
i am most ** his face reflected the flickering firelight and his bushy eyebrows stuck out fiercely
eragon nervously clasped his hands and told the story without embellishment
brom remained silent throughout it his face inscrutable
when eragon finished brom looked down at the ground
for a long time the only sound was the snapping fire
brom finally stirred
have you used this power before
no
do you know anything about it
a ** brom is face was thoughtful
it seems i owe you a debt for saving my life
i hope i can return the favor someday
you should be proud few escape unscathed from slaying their first urgal
but the manner in which you did it was very dangerous
you could have destroyed yourself and the whole town
it was not as if i had a choice said eragon defensively
the urgals were almost upon me
if i had waited they would have chopped me into **
brom stamped his teeth vigorously on the pipe stem
you did not have any idea what you were doing
then tell me challenged eragon
i ve been searching for answers to this mystery but i can not make sense of it
what happened how could i have possibly used magic no one has ever instructed me in it or taught me spells
brom is eyes flashed
this is not something you should be taught much less **
well ihave used it and i may need it to fight again
but i wo not be able to if you do not help me
what is wrong is there some secret i am not supposed to learn until i am old and wise or maybe you do not know anything about **
** roared brom
you demand answers with an insolence rarely seen
if you knew what you asked for you would not be so quick to inquire
do not try ** he paused then relaxed into a kinder countenance
the knowledge you ask for is more complex than you understand
eragon rose hotly in protest
i feel as though i ve been thrust into a world with strange rules that no one will explain
i understand said brom
he fiddled with a piece of grass
it is late and we should sleep but i will tell you a few things now to stop your badgering
this magic for it is magic has rules like the rest of the world
