here was his master
herewas a legend
as the dragon turned to land eragon gasped the creature is left foreleg had been severed by a terrible blow leaving a helpless white stump in place of the once mighty limb
tears filled his eyes
a whirlwind of dry twigs and leaves enveloped the hilltop as the dragon settled on the sweet clover and folded its wings
the rider carefully descended from his steed along the dragon is intact front right leg then approached eragon his hands clasped before him
he was an elf with silver hair old beyond measure though the only sign of age was the expression of great compassion and sadness upon his face
osthato chetowa said eragon
the mourning sage
as you asked i have ** with a jolt he remembered his manners and touched his lips
atra esterni ono thelduin
the rider smiled
he took eragon by the shoulders and lifted him upright staring at him with such kindness that eragon could look at nothing else he was consumed by the endless depths within the elf is eyes
oromis is my proper name eragon shadeslayer
you knew whispered islanzadi with a hurt expression that quickly transformed into a storm of rage
you knew of eragon is existence and yet you did not tell me why have you betrayed me shur tugal
oromis released eragon from his gaze and transferred it onto the queen
i kept my peace because it was uncertain if eragon or arya would live long enough to come here i had no wish to give you a fragile hope that might have been torn away at any moment
islanzadi spun about her cape of swan feathers billowing like wings
you had no right to withhold such information from ** i could have sent warriors to protect arya eragon and saphira in farthen dur and to escort them safely here
oromis smiled sadly
i hid nothing from you islanzadi but what you had already chosen not to see
if you had scryed the land as is your duty you would have discerned the source of the chaos that has swept alagaesia and learned the truth of arya and eragon
that you might forget the varden and the dwarves in your grief is understandable but brom vinr alfakyn the last of the elf friends you have been blind to the world islanzadi and lax upon your throne
i could not risk driving you further away by subjecting you to another loss
islanzadi is anger drained away leaving her face pale and her shoulders slumped
i am diminished she whispered
a cloud of hot moist air pressed against eragon as the gold dragon bent to examine him with eyes that glittered and ** are well met eragon shadeslayer
i am glaedr
his voice for it was unmistakably male rumbled and shook through eragon is mind like the growl of a mountain avalanche
all eragon could do was touch his lips and say i am honored
then glaedr brought his attention to bear on saphira
she remained perfectly still her neck arched stiffly as glaedr sniffed her cheek and along the line of her wing
eragon saw saphira is clenched leg muscles flutter with an involuntary ** smell of humans said glaedr and all you know of your own race is what your instincts have taught you but you have the heart of a true dragon
during this silent exchange orik presented himself to oromis
truly this is beyond anything that i dared hope or expect
you are a pleasant surprise in these dark times ** he clapped his fist over his heart
if it is not too presumptuous i would ask a boon on behalf of my king and my clan as was the custom between our people
oromis nodded
and i will grant it if it is within my power
then tell me why have you remained hidden for all these years you were sorely needed argetlam
ah said oromis
many sorrows exist in this world and one of the greatest is being unable to help those in pain
i could not risk leaving this sanctuary for if i had died before one of galbatorix is eggs had hatched then there would have been no one to pass on our secrets to the new rider and it would have been even harder to defeat galbatorix
thatwas your reason spat orik
those are the words of a ** the eggs might have never hatched
everyone went deathly quiet except for a faint growl that emanated from between glaedr is teeth
