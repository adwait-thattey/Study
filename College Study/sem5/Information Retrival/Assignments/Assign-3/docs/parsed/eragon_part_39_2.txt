her mind was alien
it felt vast and powerful weighted with memories of uncounted years
dark thoughts loomed out of sight and touch artifacts of her race that made him cringe when they brushed his consciousness
yet through all the sensations shimmered a melody of wild haunting beauty that embodied her identity
what is your name she asked speaking in the ancient language
her voice was weary and filled with quiet despair
eragon
and yours her consciousness lured him closer inviting him to submerge himself in the lyric strains of her blood
he resisted the summons with difficulty though his heart ached to accept it
for the first time he understood the fey attraction of elves
they were creatures of magic unbound by the mortal laws of the land as different from humans as dragons were from animals
arya
why have you contacted me in this manner am i still a captive of theempire
no you are ** eragon
though he knew only scattered words in the ancient language he managed to convey i was imprisoned in gil ead like you but i escaped and rescued you
in the five days since then we ve crossed the edge of the hadarac desert and are now camped by the beor mountains
you ve not stirred nor said a word in all that time
ah
so it was gil ** ** know that my wounds were healed
at the time i did not understand why preparation for some new torture i was certain
now i realize it was you
softly she added even so i have not risen and you are puzzled
during my captivity a rare poison the skilna bragh was given to me along with the drug to suppress my power
every morning the antidote for the previous day is poison was administered to me by force if i refused to take it
without it i will die within a few hours
that is why i lie in this trance it slows the skilna bragh is progress though does not stop it
i contemplated waking for the purpose of ending my life and denyinggalbatorix but i refrained from doing so out of hope that you might be an ally
her voice dwindled off weakly
how long can you remain like this asked eragon
for weeks but i am afraid i have not that much time
this dormancy cannot restrain death forever
i can feel it in my veins even now
unless i receive the antidote i will succumb to the poison in three or four days
where can the antidote be found
it exists in only two places outside of the empire with my own people and with the varden
however my home is beyond the reach of dragonback
what about the varden we would have taken you straight to them but we do not know where they are
i will tell you if you give me your word that you will never reveal their location to galbatorix or to anyone who serves him
in addition you must swear that you have not deceived me in some manner and that you intend no harm to the elves dwarves varden or the race of dragons
what arya asked for would have been simple enough if they had not been conversing in the ancient language
eragon knew she wanted oaths more binding than life itself
once made they could never be broken
that weighed heavily on him as he gravely pledged his word in agreement
it is understood
a series of vertigo inducing images suddenly flashed through his mind
he found himself riding along the beor mountain range traveling eastward many leagues
eragon did his best to remember the route as craggy mountains and hills flashed past
he was heading south now still following the mountains
then everything wheeled abruptly and he entered a narrow winding valley
it snaked through the mountains to the base of a frothy waterfall that pounded into a deep lake
the images ** is far said arya but do not let the distance dissuade you
when you arrive at the lake kostha merna at the end of the beartooth river take a rock bang on the cliff next to the waterfall and cry ai varden abr du shur tugals gata ** will be admitted
you will be challenged but do not falter no matter how perilous it seems
what should they give you for the poison he asked
her voice quavered but then she regained her ** them to give me tunivor is nectar
you must leave me now
i have expended too much energy already
