once my mind cleared i cursed myself for a fool but i had sworn i would so i had no choice but to fulfill my oath
when orik paused eragon asked what happened
oh i killed a nagra with help from the vrenshrrgn but the boar gored me in the shoulder and tossed me into the branches of a nearby tree
the vrenshrrgn had to carry the both of us the nagra and me back to bregan hold
the boar pleased hrothgar and i
i despite the ministrations of our best healers i had to spend the next month resting in bed which hrothgar said was punishment enough for defying his orders
eragon watched the dwarf for a while
you miss him
orik stood for a moment with his chin tucked against his stocky chest
lifting his ax he struck the granite with the end of the haft producing a sharp clack that echoed among the trees
it has been nigh on two centuries since the last durgrimstvren the last clan war racked our nation eragon
but by morgothal is black beard we stand on the brink of another one now
now of all times exclaimed eragon appalled
is it really that bad
orik scowled
it is worse
tensions between the clans are higher than they have ever been in living memory
hrothgar is death and nasuada is invasion of the empire have served to inflame passions aggravate old rivalries and lend strength to those who believe it is folly to cast our lot with the varden
how can they believe that when galbatorix has already attacked tronjheim with the urgals
because said orik they are convinced it is impossible to defeat galbatorix and their argument holds much sway with our people
can you honestly tell me eragon that if galbatorix were to confront you and saphira this very instant that the two of you could best him
i thought not
those who are opposed to the varden have blinded themselves to galbatorix is threat
they say that if we had refused shelter to the varden if we had not accepted you and saphira into fair tronjheim then galbatorix would have had no reason to make war on us
they say that if we just keep to ourselves and remain hidden in our caves and tunnels we shall have nothing to fear from galbatorix
they do not realize that galbatorix is hunger for power is insatiable and that he will not rest until all of alagaesia lies at his ** orik shook his head and the muscles in his forearms bunched and knotted as he pinched the ax blade between his wide fingers
i will not allow our race to cower in tunnels like frightened rabbits until the wolf outside digs his way in and eats us all
we must continue fighting out of the hope that somehow we can find a way to kill galbatorix
and i will not allow our nation to disintegrate into a clan war
with circumstances as they are another durgrimstvren would destroy our civilization and possibly doom the varden as ** his jaw set orik turned toward eragon
for the good of my people i intend to seek the throne myself
durgrimstn gedthrall ledwonnu and nagra have already pledged their support to me
however there are many who stand between me and the crown it will not be easy to garner enough votes to become king
i need to know eragon will you back me in this
crossing his arms eragon walked from one tree to the next and then back again
if i do my support might turn the other clans against you
not only will you be asking your people to ally themselves with the varden you will be asking them to accept a dragon rider as one of their own which they have never done before and i doubt they will want to now
aye it may turn some against me said orik but it may also gain me the votes of others
let me be the judge of that
all i wish to know is will you back me
eragon why do you hesitate
eragon stared at a gnarled root that rose out of the granite by his feet avoiding orik is eyes
you are concerned about the good of your people and rightly so
but my concerns are broader they encompass the good of the varden and the elves and everyone else who opposes galbatorix
if
if it is not likely you can win the crown and there is another clan chief who could and who is not unsympathetic to the varden
no one would be a more sympathetic grimstnzborith than **
