a flicker of movement to the northeast caught her attention and she angled toward it curious
she saw a line of five and forty weary horses trudging toward the varden
most of the horses were riderless therefore it did not occur to her until another half hour had elapsed and she could make out the faces of the men in the saddles that the group might be roran is returning from their raid
she wondered what had happened to so reduce their numbers and felt a momentary twinge of unease
she was not bonded to roran but eragon cared for him and that was reason enough for her to worry about his well being
pushing her consciousness down toward the disorganized varden she searched until she found the music of arya is mind and once the elf acknowledged her and allowed access to her thoughts saphira said roran shall be here by late afternoon
however his company is sore diminished
some great evil befell them this trip
thank you saphira said arya
i shall inform nasuada
as saphira withdrew from arya is mind she felt the questing touch of black blue wolf hair blodhgarm
i am not a hatchling she snapped
you need not check on my health every few minutes
you have my most humble apologies bjartskular only you have been gone for quite some time now and if any are watching they will begin to wonder why you and
yes i know she growled
shortening her wingspan she tilted downward the sensation of weight leaving her and gyrated in slow spirals as she dove toward the turgid river
i shall be there shortly
a thousand feet above the water she flared her wings and felt the strain in her flight membranes as the wind pressed against them with immense force
she slowed to a near standstill then spilled air from her wings and accelerated once more gliding to within a hundred feet of the brown not good to drink water
with an occasional flap to maintain her altitude she flew up the jiet river alert for the sudden changes of pressure that plagued cool air above flowing water and that could push her in an unexpected direction or worse into sharp pointy trees or the break bone ground
she swept high above the varden gathered next to the river high enough that her arrival would not unduly frighten the silly horses
then drifting downward upon still wings she landed in a clearing among the tents a clearing nasuada had ordered set aside just for her and crawled through the camp to eragon is empty tent where blodhgarm and the eleven other elves he commanded were waiting for her
she greeted them with a blink of her eyes and a flick of her tongue and then curled up in front of eragon is tent resigned to dozing and waiting for dark as she would if eragon were actually in the tent and he and she were flying missions at night
it was dull tedious work lying there day after day but it was necessary in order to maintain the deception that eragon was still with the varden so saphira did not complain even if after twelve or more hours spent on the rough hard ground dirtying her scales she felt like fighting a thousand soldiers or razing a forest with tooth and claw and fire or leaping up and flying until she could fly no more or until she reached the end of earth water and air
growling to herself she kneaded the ground with her claws softening it then lay her head across her forelegs and closed her inner eyelids so she could rest and still watch those who walked by
a dragonfly buzzed over her head and not for the first time she wondered what could have possibly inspired some feebleminded runtling to name the insect after her race
it looks nothing like a dragon she grumbled then drifted off into a light sleep
saphira started up and bounded through the camp the twelve elves running in formation around her
men leaped out of their path shouting hail ** and hail ** which kindled a warm glow in her belly
when she arrived at nasuada is folded wing red butterfly chrysalis tent she crouched and stuck her head inside the dark gap along one wall where nasuada is guards had pulled aside a panel of fabric to allow her access
blodhgarm resumed his soft singing then and the eragon wraith climbed down off saphira entered the crimson tent and once it was out of sight of the gawking onlookers outside dissolved into nothingness
