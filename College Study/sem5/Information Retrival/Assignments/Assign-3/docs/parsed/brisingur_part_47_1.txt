the sun was clear and bright overhead when the first of the city is buildings a narrow twisting turret with glittering windows that stood between three tall pine trees and was grown out of their intermingled branches came into view
beyond the bark sheathed turret eragon spotted the seemingly random collection of clearings that marked the location of the sprawling city
as saphira planed over the uneven surface of the forest eragon quested with his mind for the consciousness of gilderien the wise who as the wielder of the white flame of vandil had protected ellesmera from the elves enemies for over two and a half millennia
projecting his thoughts toward the city eragon said in the ancient language gilderien elda may we pass
a deep calm voice sounded in eragon is mind
you may pass eragon shadeslayer and saphira brightscales
so long as you keep the peace you are welcome to stay in ellesmera
her claws brushed the crowns of the dark needled trees which rose over three hundred feet above the ground as she glided across the pinewood city and headed toward the slope of inclined land on the other side of ellesmera
between the latticework of branches below eragon caught brief glimpses of the flowing shapes of buildings made of living wood colorful beds of blooming flowers rippling streams the auburn glow of a flameless lantern and once or twice the pale flash of an elf is upturned face
tilting her wings saphira soared up the slope of land until she reached the crags of tel naeir which dropped over a thousand feet to the rolling forest at the base of the bare white cliff and extended for a league in either direction
then she turned right and flew north along the ridge of stone flapping twice to maintain her speed and altitude
a grass covered clearing appeared at the edge of the cliff
set against the backdrop of the surrounding trees was a modest single story house grown out of four different pines
a chuckling gurgling stream wandered out of the mossy forest and passed underneath the roots of one of the pines before disappearing into du weldenvarden once again
and curled up next to the house there lay the golden dragon glaedr massive glittering his ivory teeth as thick around as eragon is chest his claws like scythes his folded wings soft as suede his muscled tail nearly as long as all of saphira and the striations of his one visible eye sparkling like the rays within a star sapphire
the stump of his missing foreleg was concealed on the other side of his body
a small round table and two chairs had been placed in front of glaedr
oromis sat in the chair closest to him the elf is silver hair gleaming like metal in the sunlight
eragon leaned forward in his saddle as saphira reared upright slowing herself
she descended with a jolt upon the sward of green grass and ran forward several steps raking her wings backward before she came to a halt
his fingers clumsy from exhaustion eragon loosened the slipknots that bound the straps around his legs and then attempted to climb down saphira is right front leg
as he lowered himself his knees buckled and he fell
he raised his hands to protect his face and landed upon all fours scraping his shin on a rock hidden within the grass
he grunted with pain and feeling as stiff as an old man started to push himself onto his feet
a hand entered his field of vision
eragon looked up and saw oromis standing over him a faint smile upon his timeless face
in the ancient language oromis said welcome back to ellesmera eragon finiarel
and you as well saphira brightscales welcome
welcome both of you
eragon took his hand and oromis pulled him upright without apparent effort
at first eragon was unable to find his tongue for he had barely spoken aloud since they had left farthen dur and because fatigue blurred his mind
he touched the first two fingers of his right hand to his lips and also in the ancient language said may good fortune rule over you oromis elda and then he twisted his hand over his sternum in the gesture of courtesy and respect the elves used
