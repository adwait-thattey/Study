the angles at the bases of the walls were perfectly square and as far as he could tell the tunnel itself did not vary from its course by even an inch
as they proceeded eragon is anticipation about meeting ajihad increased
the leader of the varden was a shadowy figure to the people within the empire
he had risen to power nearly twenty years ago and since then had waged a fierce war against king galbatorix
no one knew where he came from or even what he looked like
it was rumored that he was a master strategist a brutal fighter
with such a reputation eragon worried about how they would be received
still knowing that brom had trusted the varden enough to serve them helped to allay his fears
seeing orik again had brought forth new questions in his mind
the tunnel was obviously dwarf work no one else could mine with such skill but were the dwarves part of the varden or were they merely sheltering them and who was the king that orik had mentioned was it ajihad eragon understood now that the varden had been able to escape discovery by hiding underground but what about the elves where were they
for nearly an hour the bald man led them through the tunnel never straying nor ** ve probably already gone a league eragon ** they re taking us all the way through the ** at last a soft white glow became visible ahead of them
he strained his eyes trying to discern its source but it was still too far away to make out any details
the glow increased in strength as they neared it
now he could see thick marble pillars laced with rubies and amethysts standing in rows along the walls
scores of lanterns hung between the pillars suffusing the air with liquid brilliance
gold tracery gleamed from the pillars bases like molten thread
arching over the ceiling were carved raven heads their beaks open in mid screech
at the end of the hallway rested two colossal black doors accented by shimmering silver lines that depicted a seven pointed crown that spanned both sides
the bald man stopped and raised a hand
he turned to eragon
you will ride upon your dragon now
do not attempt to fly away
there will be people watching so remember who and what you are
eragon dismounted snowfire and then clambered onto saphira is ** think they want to show us off she said as he settled into the saddle
we will see
i wish i had zar roc he replied tightening the straps around his legs
it might be better that you are not wearing morzan is sword when the varden first see you
** i am ready eragon said squaring his shoulders
good said the bald man
he and orik retreated to either side of saphira staying far enough back so she was clearly in the lead
now walk to the doors and once they open follow the path
go slowly
of ** approached the doors at a measured pace
her scales sparkled in the light sending glints of color dancing over the pillars
eragon took a deep breath to steady his nerves
without warning the doors swung outward on hidden joints
as the rift widened between them rays of sunlight streamed into the tunnel falling on saphira and eragon
temporarily blinded eragon blinked and squinted
when his eyes adjusted to the light he gasped
they were inside a massive volcanic crater
its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high above that eragon could not judge the distance it might have been more than a dozen miles
a soft beam of light fell through the aperture illuminating the crater is center though it left the rest of the cavernous expanse in hushed twilight
the crater is far side hazy blue in the distance looked to be nearly ten miles away
giant icicles hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long hung leagues above them like glistening daggers
eragon knew from his experience in the valley that no one not even saphira could reach those lofty points
farther down the crater is inner walls dark mats of moss and lichen covered the rock
he lowered his gaze and saw a wide cobblestone path extending from the doors threshold
the path ran straight to the center of the crater where it ended at the base of a snowy white mountain that glittered like an uncut gem with thousands of colored lights
