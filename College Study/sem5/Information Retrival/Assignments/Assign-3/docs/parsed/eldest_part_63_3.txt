ahgrat ukmar growled the kull clapping his fists to his brow
you are a wise herndall lady nightstalker
why do you call me that
garzhvog made aruk ruk sound in his throat that eragon interpreted as laughter
nightstalker is the name we gave your sire because of how he hunted us in the dark tunnels under the dwarf mountain and because of the color of his hide
as his cub you are worthy of the same ** with that he turned on his heel and strode out of the camp
standing nasuada proclaimed anyone who attacks the urgals shall be punished as if he attacked a fellow human
see that word of this is posted in every company
no sooner had she finished than eragon noticed king orrin approaching at a quick pace his cape flapping around him
when he was close enough he cried ** is it true you met with an urgal what do you mean by it and why was not i alerted sooner i do not
he was interrupted as a sentry emerged from the ranks of gray tents shouting a horseman approaches from the **
in an instant king orrin forgot his argument and joined nasuada as she hurried toward the vanguard of the army followed by at least a hundred people
rather than stay among the crowd eragon pulled himself onto saphira and let her carry him to their destination
when saphira halted at the ramparts trenches and rows of sharpened poles that protected the varden is leading edge eragon saw a lone soldier riding at a furious clip across the bleak no man is land
above him the birds of prey swooped low to discover if the first course of their feast had arrived
the soldier reined in his black stallion some thirty yards from the breastwork keeping as much distance as possible between him and the varden
he shouted by refusing king galbatorix is generous terms of surrender you choose death as your fate
no more shall we negotiate
the hand of friendship has turned into the fist of ** if any of you still hold regard for your rightful sovereign the all knowing all powerful king galbatorix then ** none may stand before us once we set forth to cleanse alagaesia of every miscreant traitor and subversive
and though it pains our lord for he knows that most of these rebellious acts are instigated by bitter and misguided leaders we shall gently chastise the unlawful territory known as surda and return it to the benevolent rule of king galbatorix he who sacrifices himself day and night for the good of his people
so flee i say or suffer the doom of your herald
with that the soldier untied a canvas sack and flourished a severed head
he threw it into the air and watched it fall among the varden then turned his stallion dug in his spurs and galloped back toward the dark mass of galbatorix is army
shall i kill him asked eragon
nasuada shook her head
we will have our due soon enough
i wo not violate the sanctity of envoys even if the empire has
as you he yelped with surprise and clutched saphira is neck to keep from falling as she reared above the ramparts planting her front legs upon the chartreuse bank
opening her jaws saphira uttered a long deep roar much like garzhvog had done only this roar was a defiant challenge to their enemies a warning of the wrath they had roused and a clarion call to all who hated galbatorix
the sound of her trumpeting voice frightened the stallion so badly he jinked to the right slipped on the heated ground and fell on his side
the soldier was thrown free of the horse and landed in a gout of fire that erupted at that very instant
he uttered a single cry so horrible it made eragon is scalp prickle then was silent and still forevermore
the varden cheered saphira is accomplishment
even nasuada allowed herself a small smile
then she clapped her hands and said they will attack at dawn i think
eragon gather du vrangr gata and prepare yourself for action
i will have orders for you within the ** taking orrin by the shoulder she guided him back toward the center of the compound saying sire there are decisions we must make
i have a certain plan but it will require
let them come said saphira
the tip of her tail twitched like that of a cat stalking a ** will all burn
