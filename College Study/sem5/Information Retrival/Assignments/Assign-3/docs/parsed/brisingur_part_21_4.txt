like a split in blue gray granite a wide grin spread across his jaw transforming his features
a ** he breathed
imagine me tanning the leather for a rider is ** and without a hint of what i was doing at the time no ** no not a rider the rider
he who will finally cast down the black tyrant ** if only my father could see me ** kicking up his heels gedric danced an impromptu jig
with his grin undiminished he bowed to eragon and trotted back to his place among the villagers where he began to relate his tale to everyone within earshot
eager to escape before the lot of them could descend upon him eragon slipped away between the rows of tents pleased with what he had accomplished
it might take me a while he thought but i always settle my debts
before long he arrived at another tent close to the eastern edge of the camp
he knocked on the pole between the two front flaps
with a sharp sound the entrance was yanked aside to reveal jeod is wife helen standing in the opening
she regarded eragon with a cold expression
you ve come to talk with him i suppose
if he is ** which eragon knew perfectly well he was for he could sense jeod is mind as clearly as helen is
for a moment eragon thought helen might deny the presence of her husband but then she shrugged and moved aside
you might as well come in then
eragon found jeod sitting on a stool poring over an assortment of scrolls books and sheaves of loose papers that were piled high on a cot bare of blankets
a thin shock of hair hung across jeod is forehead mimicking the curve of the scar that stretched from his scalp to his left temple
** he cried as he saw him the lines of concentration on his face clearing
welcome ** he shook eragon is hand and then offered him the stool
here i shall sit on the corner of the bed
no please you are our guest
would you care for some food or drink nasuada gives us an extra ration so do not restrain yourself for fear that we will go hungry on your account
it is poor fare compared with what we served you in teirm but then no one should go to war and expect to eat well not even a king
a cup of tea would be nice said eragon
tea and biscuits it ** jeod glanced at helen
snatching the kettle off the ground helen braced it against her hip fit the nipple of a waterskin in the end of the spout and squeezed
the kettle reverberated with a dull roar as a stream of water struck the bottom
helen is fingers tightened around the neck of the waterskin restricting the flow to a languorous trickle
she remained thus with the detached look of a person performing an unpleasant task while the water droplets drummed out a maddening beat against the inside of the kettle
an apologetic smile flickered across jeod is face
he stared at a scrap of paper beside his knee as he waited for helen to finish
eragon studied a wrinkle in the side of the tent
the bombastic trickle continued for over three minutes
when the kettle was finally full helen removed the deflated waterskin from the spout hung it on a hook on the center pole of the tent and stormed out
eragon raised an eyebrow at jeod
jeod spread his hands
my position with the varden is not as prominent as she had hoped and she blames me for the fact
she agreed to flee teirm with me expecting or so i believe that nasuada would vault me into the inner circle of her advisers or grant me lands and riches fit for a lord or some other extravagant reward for my help stealing saphira is egg those many years ago
what helen did not bargain on was the unglamorous life of a common swordsman sleeping in a tent fixing her own food washing her own clothes and so on
it is not that wealth and status are her only concerns but you have to understand she was born into one of the richest shipping families of teirm and for most of our marriage i was not unsuccessful in my own ventures
she is unused to such privations as these and she has yet to reconcile herself to ** his shoulders rose and fell a fraction of an inch
my own hope was that this adventure if it deserves such a romantic term would narrow the rifts that have opened between us in recent years but as always nothing is ever as simple as it seems
