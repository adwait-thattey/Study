she strove to remain conscious as her vision dimmed and flickered the last thing she wanted to do was pass out in front of the tribesmen
a gentle pressure on her shoulder alerted her to the fact that farica was standing next to her holding a pile of bandages
my lady may i tend to you asked farica her expression both concerned and hesitant as if she were uncertain how nasuada would react
as farica began to wind strips of linen around her arms naako and ramusewa approached
they bowed and ramusewa said never before has anyone endured so many cuts in the trial of the long knives
both you and fadawar proved your mettle but you are undoubtedly the victor
we shall tell our people of your achievement and they shall give you their fealty
thank you said nasuada
she closed her eyes as the throbbing in her arms increased
around her nasuada heard a confused medley of sounds which she made no effort to decipher preferring instead to retreat deep inside herself where her pain was no longer so immediate and menacing
she floated in the womb of a boundless black space illuminated by formless blobs of ever changing color
her respite was interrupted by the voice of trianna as the sorceress said leave off what you re doing handmaid and remove those bandages so i can heal your mistress
nasuada opened her eyes to see jormundur king orrin and trianna standing over her
fadawar and his men had departed the pavilion
no said nasuada
the group looked at her with surprise and then jormundur said nasuada your thoughts are clouded
the trial is over
you do not have to live with these cuts any longer
in any event we have to stanch your bleeding
farica is doing that well enough as is
i shall have a healer stitch my wounds and make a poultice to reduce the swelling and that is all
the trial of the long knives requires participants to allow their wounds to heal at their natural pace
otherwise we wo not have experienced the full measure of pain the trial entails
if i violate the rule fadawar will be declared the victor
will you at least allow me to alleviate your suffering asked trianna
i know several spells that can eliminate any amount of pain
if you had consulted me beforehand i could have arranged it so that you could lop off an entire limb without the slightest discomfort
nasuada laughed and allowed her head to loll to the side feeling rather giddy
my answer would have been the same then as it is now trickery is dishonorable
i had to win the trial without deceit so no one can question my leadership in the future
in a deadly soft tone king orrin said but what if you had lost
i could not lose
even if it meant my death i never would have allowed fadawar to gain control of the varden
grave orrin studied her for a long while
i believe you
only is the tribes loyalty worth such a great sacrifice you are not so common that we can easily replace you
the tribes loyalty no
but this will have an effect far beyond the tribes as you must know
it should help unify our forces
and that is a prize valuable enough for me to willingly brave a host of unpleasant deaths
pray tell what would the varden have gained if you had died today no benefit would exist then
your legacy would be discouragement chaos and likely ruin
whenever nasuada drank wine mead and especially strong spirits she became most cautious with her speech and motions for even if she did not notice it at once she knew the alcohol degraded her judgment and coordination and she had no desire to behave inappropriately or to give others an advantage in their dealings with her
pain drunk as she was she later realized she should have been as vigilant in her discussion with orrin as if she had imbibed three tankards of the dwarves blackberry honey mead
if she had her well developed sense of courtesy would have prevented her from replying so you worry like an old man orrin
i had to do this and it is done
tis bootless to fret about it now
i took a risk yes
but we cannot defeat galbatorix unless we dance along the very cliff edge of disaster
you are a king
you ought to understand that danger is the mantle a person assumes when he or she has the arrogance to decide the fates of other men
