you know ** galbatorix could end this war at any time if he was willing to leave his castle and confront the varden directly
we have to talk with our teachers again
they can tell us where galbatorix is power is coming from and they might be able to show us a trick or two that will allow us to defeat him
nasuada gazed downward studying her hands
thorn and murtagh could destroy us while you were gone
and if we do not go galbatorix will destroy us when we reach uru baen
could you wait a few days before you attack feinster
we could but every day we camp outside the city will cost us ** nasuada rubbed her temples with the heels of her palms
you are asking a lot in exchange for an uncertain reward eragon
the reward may be uncertain he said but our doom is inevitable unless we try
is it i am not so sure
still
for an uncomfortably long time nasuada was silent gazing past the edge of the image
then she nodded once as if confirming something to herself and said i can delay our arrival at feinster for two or three days
there are several towns in the area we can seize first
once we do reach the city i can pass another two or three days having the varden build siege engines and prepare fortifications
no one will think strangely of it
after that though i will have to set upon feinster if for no other reason but that we need their supplies
an army that sits still in enemy territory is an army that starves
at the most i can give you six days and perhaps only four
as she spoke eragon made several quick calculations
four days wo not be long enough he said and six might not be either
it took saphira three days to fly to farthen dur and that was without stopping to sleep and without having to carry my weight
if the maps i have seen are accurate it is at least as far from here to ellesmera maybe farther and about the same from ellesmera to feinster
and with me on her back saphira wo not be able to cover the distance as quickly
no i wo not saphira said to him
eragon continued even under the best of circumstances it would still take us a week to reach you at feinster and that would be without staying for more than a minute in ellesmera
an expression of profound exhaustion crossed nasuada is face
must you fly all the way to ellesmera would not it be sufficient to scry with your mentors once you are past the wards along the edge of du weldenvarden the time you would save could be crucial
i do not know
we can try
nasuada closed her eyes for a moment
in a hoarse voice she said i may be able to delay our arrival at feinster for four days
go to ellesmera or do not i leave the decision up to you
if you do then stay however long is needed
you re right unless you find a way to defeat galbatorix we have no hope of victory
even so keep you in mind the tremendous risk we are taking the lives of the varden i will be sacrificing in order to buy you this time and how many more of the varden will die if we lay siege to feinster without you
somber eragon nodded
i wo not forget
i should hope not
now ** do not tarry any ** fly
** fly faster than a diving hawk saphira and do not let anything slow ** nasuada touched the tips of her fingers to her lips and then pressed them against the invisible surface of the mirror where he knew she beheld the moving likeness of him and saphira
luck on your journey eragon saphira
if we meet again i fear it will be on the field of battle
and then she hurried from their sight and eragon released his spell and the water in the basin cleared
