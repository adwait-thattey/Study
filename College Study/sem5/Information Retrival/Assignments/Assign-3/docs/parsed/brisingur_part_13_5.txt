that is heartening
since eragon is defeat at the hands of murtagh i have been wondering if we should retreat and hide until eragon is strength increases
your assurances convince me that we are not entirely without hope
we may have no idea how to kill galbatorix himself but until we batter down the gates of his citadel in uru baen or until he chooses to fly out on shruikan and confront us on the field of battle nothing shall stop ** she paused
you have given me no reason to distrust you blodhgarm but before you enter our camp i must ask that you allow one of my men to touch each of your minds to confirm that you are actually elves and not humans galbatorix has sent here in disguise
it pains me to make such a request but we have been plagued by spies and traitors and we dare not take you or anyone else at their word
it is not my intention to cause offense but war has taught us these precautions are necessary
surely you who have ringed the entire leafy expanse of du weldenvarden with protective spells can understand my reasons
so i ask will you agree to this
blodhgarm is eyes were feral and his teeth were alarmingly sharp as he said for the most part the trees of du weldenvarden have needles not leaves
test us if you must but i warn you whomever you assign the task should take great care he does not delve too deeply into our minds else he may find himself stripped of his reason
it is perilous for mortals to wander among our thoughts they can easily become lost and be unable to return to their bodies
nor are our secrets available for general inspection
nasuada understood
the elves would destroy anyone who ventured into forbidden territory
captain garven she said
stepping forward with the expression of a man approaching his doom garven stood opposite blodhgarm closed his eyes and frowned intensely as he searched out blodhgarm is consciousness
nasuada bit the inside of her lip as she watched
when she was a child a one legged man by the name of hargrove had taught her how to conceal her thoughts from telepaths and how to block and divert the stabbing lances of a mental attack
at both those skills she excelled and although she had never succeeded at initiating contact with the mind of another she was thoroughly familiar with the principles involved
she empathized then with the difficulty and the delicacy of what garven was trying to do a trial only made harder by the strange nature of the elves
leaning toward her angela whispered you should have had me check the elves
it would have been safer
perhaps said nasuada
despite all the help the herbalist had given her and the varden she still felt uncomfortable relying upon her for official business
for a few moments longer garven continued his efforts and then his eyes snapped open and he released his breath in an explosive burst
his neck and face were mottled from the strain and his pupils were dilated as if it were night
in contrast blodhgarm appeared undisturbed his fur was smooth his breathing regular and a faint smile of amusement flickered about the corners of his lips
it seemed to take garven a longish while to hear her question and then the burly captain with the crooked nose said he is not human my lady
of that i have no doubt
no doubt whatsoever
pleased and disturbed for there was something uncomfortably remote about his reply nasuada said very well
** thereafter garven required less and less time to examine each elf spending no more than a half dozen seconds on the very last of the group
nasuada kept a close eye on him throughout the process and she saw how his fingers became white and bloodless and the skin at his temples sank into his skull like the eardrums of a frog and he acquired the languid appearance of a person swimming deep underwater
having completed his assignment garven returned to his post beside nasuada
he was she thought a changed man
his original determination and fierceness of spirit had faded into the dreamy air of a sleepwalker and while he looked at her when she asked if he was well and he answered in an even enough tone she felt as if his spirit was far away ambling among dusty sunlit glades somewhere in the elves mysterious forest
