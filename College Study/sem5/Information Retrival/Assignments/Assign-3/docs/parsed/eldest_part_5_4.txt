because said jormundur selecting his words with care ajihad was speaking of military matters then nothing more
also i am a member of this council which only has power because we support one another
it would be foolish and dangerous for one of us to raise himself above the ** the council relaxed as he finished and elessari patted jormundur on the forearm
** ** probably would have taken power if it were possible to force the others to back him
just look how they eye him
he is like a wolf in their midst
a wolf in a pack of jackals perhaps
does nasuada have enough experience inquired eragon
elessari pressed herself against the table is edge as she leaned forward
i had already been here for seven years when ajihad joined the varden
i ve watched nasuada grow up from a darling girl to the woman she is
a trifle light headed occasionally but a good figure to lead the varden
the people will love her
now i she patted herself affectionately on the bosom and my friends will be here to guide her through these troubled times
she will never be without someone to show her the way
inexperience should be no barrier to her taking her rightful position
understanding flooded ** want a puppet
ajihad is funeral will be held in two days broke in umerth
directly afterward we plan to appoint nasuada as our new leader
we have yet to ask her but she will surely agree
we want you to be present at the appointing no one not even hrothgar can complain about it then and to swear fealty to the varden
that will give back the confidence ajihad is death has stolen from the people and prevent anyone from trying to splinter this organization
saphira quickly touched eragon is ** they do not want you to swear to nasuada just to the varden
yes and they want to be the ones to appoint nasuada which would indicate that the council is more powerful than she
they could have asked arya or us to appoint her but that would mean acknowledging whoever did it as above everyone in the varden
this way they assert their superiority over nasuada gain control over us through fealty and also get the benefit of having a rider endorse nasuada in public
what happens he asked if i decide not to accept your offer
offer falberd asked seeming puzzled
why nothing of course
only it would be a terrible slight if you re not present when nasuada is chosen
if the hero of the battle of farthen dur ignores her what can she think but that a rider has spited her and found the varden unworthy to serve who could bear such a shame
the message could have been no clearer
eragon clenched zar roc is pommel under the table yearning to scream that it was unnecessary to force him to support the varden that he would have done it anyway
now however he instinctively wanted to rebel to elude the shackles they were trying to place on him
since riders are so highly thought of i could decide that my efforts would be best spent guiding the varden myself
the mood in the room hardened
that would be unwise stated sabrae
eragon combed his mind for a way to escape the ** ajihad gone said saphira it may be impossible to remain independent of every group as he wanted us to
we cannot anger the varden and if this council is to control it once nasuada is in place then we must appease them
remember they act as much out of self preservation as we do
but what will they want us to do once we are in their grasp will they respect the varden is pact with the elves and send us to ellesmera for training or command otherwise jormundur strikes me as an honorable man but the rest of the council i can not tell
saphira brushed the top of his head with her ** to be at this ceremony with nasuada that much i think we must do
as for swearing fealty see if you can avoid acquiescing
perhaps something will occur between now and then that will change our position
arya may have a solution
without warning eragon nodded and said as you wish i shall attend nasuada is appointment
jormundur looked relieved
good good
then we have only one more matter to deal with before you go nasuada is acceptance
there is no reason to delay with all of us here
