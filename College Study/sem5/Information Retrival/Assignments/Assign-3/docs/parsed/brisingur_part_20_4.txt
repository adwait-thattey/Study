what madness is this asked saphira
even if you can put it out of your mind why remain shackled to the pain of others when eragon may yet be able to free you of it
elva is eyes glowed with unsavory glee
i will never be like ordinary people
if i must be different then let me keep that which sets me apart
as long as i can control this power as it seems i now can i have no objection to carrying this burden for it shall be by my choice and not forced upon me by your magic eragon
** from now on i shall answer to no one and no thing
if i help anyone it will be because i want to
if i serve the varden it will be because my conscience tells me i should and not because you ask me to nasuada or because i will throw up if i do not
i will do as i please and woe unto those who oppose me for i know all their fears and shall not hesitate to play upon them in order to fulfill my wishes
** exclaimed greta
do not say such terrible ** you cannot mean **
the girl turned toward her so sharply her hair fanned out behind her
ah yes i had forgotten about you my nursemaid
ever faithful
always fussing
i am grateful to you for adopting me after my mother died and for the care you ve given me since farthen dur but i do not require your assistance anymore
i will live alone tend to myself and be beholden to no ** cowed the old woman covered her mouth with the hem of a sleeve and shrank back
what elva said appalled eragon
he decided that he could not allow her to retain her ability if she was going to abuse it
with saphira is assistance for she agreed with him he picked the most promising of the new counterspells he had been contemplating earlier and opened his mouth to deliver the lines
quick as a snake elva clamped a hand over his lips preventing him from speaking
the pavilion shook as saphira snarled nearly deafening eragon with his enhanced hearing
as everyone reeled save for elva who kept her hand pressed against eragon is face saphira said let him go hatchling
drawn by saphira is snarl nasuada is six guards charged inside brandishing their weapons while blodhgarm and the other elves ran up to saphira and stationed themselves on either side of her shoulders pulling back the wall of the tent so they could all see what was happening
nasuada gestured and the nighthawks lowered their weapons but the elves remained poised for action
their blades gleamed like ice
neither the commotion she had engendered nor the swords leveled at her seemed to perturb elva
she cocked her head and gazed at eragon as if he were an unusual beetle she had found crawling along the edge of her chair and then she smiled with such a sweet innocent expression he wondered why he did not have greater faith in her character
in a voice like warm honey she said eragon cease
if you cast that spell you will hurt me as you hurt me once before
you do not want that
every night when you lay yourself down to sleep you will think of me and the memory of the wrong you have committed will torment you
what you were about to do was evil eragon
are you the judge of the world will you condemn me in the absence of wrongdoing merely because you do not approve of me that way lies the depraved pleasure of controlling others for your own satisfaction
galbatorix would approve
she released him then but eragon was too troubled to move
she had struck at his very core and he had no counterarguments with which to defend himself for her questions and observations were the very ones he directed at himself
her understanding of him sent a chill crawling down his spine
i am grateful to you also eragon for coming here today to correct your mistake
not everyone is as willing to acknowledge and confront their shortcomings
however you have earned no favor with me today
you have righted the scales as best you could but that is only what any decent person ought to have done
you have not compensated me for what i have endured nor can you
so when next we cross paths eragon shadeslayer count me not as a friend or foe
i am ambivalent toward you rider i am just as prepared to hate you as i am to love you
