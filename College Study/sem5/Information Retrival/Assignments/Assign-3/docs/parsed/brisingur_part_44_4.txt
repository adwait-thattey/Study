katrina seemed to sense his desire however for she said angela believes that with a bit of luck you wo not scar too badly
in either case once you re completely healed eragon or another magician can remove the scars from your back and it will be as if you were never whipped in the first place
would you like something to drink she asked
i have a pot of yarrow tea steeping
as katrina rose roran heard another person enter the tent
he opened one eye and was surprised to see nasuada standing next to the pole at the front of the tent
my lady katrina said her voice razor sharp
in spite of the lances of pain from his back roran pushed himself partially up and with katrina is help swung himself into a sitting position
leaning on katrina he started to stand but nasuada lifted a hand
please do not
i do not wish to cause you any more distress than i already have
why have you come lady nasuada asked katrina
roran needs to rest and recover not to spend his time talking when he does not have to
roran placed a hand on katrina is left shoulder
i can talk if i must he said
moving farther into the tent nasuada lifted the hem of her green dress and sat on the small chest of belongings katrina had brought with her from carvahall
after arranging the folds of her skirt she said i have another mission for you roran a small raid similar to those you have already participated in
when will i leave he asked puzzled that she would bother to inform him in person of such a simple assignment
katrina is eyes widened
are you mad she exclaimed
katrina
roran murmured attempting to placate her but she shrugged off his hand and said the last trip you sent him on nearly killed him and you ve just had him whipped within an inch of his ** you can not order him back into combat so soon he would not last more than a minute against galbatorix is **
i can and i ** said nasuada with such authority katrina held her tongue and waited to hear nasuada is explanation although roran could tell that her anger had not subsided
gazing at him intensely nasuada said roran as you may or may not be aware our alliance with the urgals is upon the verge of collapse
one of our own murdered three of the urgals while you were serving under captain edric who you may be pleased to know is a captain no more
anyway i had the miserable wretch who killed the urgals hanged but ever since our relations with garzhvog is rams have become increasingly precarious
what does this have to do with roran katrina demanded
nasuada pressed her lips together then said i need to convince the varden to accept the presence of the urgals without further bloodshed and the best way i can do that is to show the varden that our two races can work together in peaceful pursuit of a common goal
toward that end the group you shall be traveling with will contain equal numbers of both humans and urgals
but that still does not katrina started to say
and i am placing the whole lot of them under your command stronghammer
with a wry smile nasuada said because you will do whatever you have to in order to protect your friends and family
in this you are like me although my family is larger than yours for i consider the whole of the varden my kin
also because you are eragon is cousin i cannot afford to have you commit insubordination again for then i will have no choice but to execute you or expel you from the varden
neither of which i wish to do
therefore i am giving you your own command so that there is no one above you to disobey except me
if you ignore my orders it had better be to kill galbatorix no other reason will save you from far worse than the lashes you earned today
and i am giving you this command because you have proven that you are able to convince others to follow you even in the face of the most daunting circumstances
you have as good a chance as any of maintaining control over a group of urgals and humans
i would send eragon if i could but since he is not here the responsibility falls to you
when the varden hear that eragon is own cousin roran stronghammer he who slew nigh on two hundred soldiers by himself went on a mission with urgals and that the mission was a success then we may yet keep the urgals as our allies for the duration of this war
