eragon jumped to the floor and winced as he saw the damage the urgal had done
four of the metal plates on saphira is chest had been hammered together restricting her ability to bend and breathe
stay well he said putting a hand on her side then ran out the archway
he stopped and swore
he was at the top of vol turin the endless staircase
because of his worry for saphira he had not considered how he would get to tronjheim is base where the urgals were breaking in
there was no time to climb down
he looked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs then grabbed one of the leather pads and threw himself down on it
the stone slide was smooth as lacquered wood
with the leather underneath him he accelerated almost instantly to a frightening speed the walls blurring and the curve of the slide pressing him high against the wall
eragon lay completely flat so he would go faster
the air rushed past his helm making it vibrate like a weather vane in a gale
the trough was too confined for him and he was perilously close to flying out but as long as he kept his arms and legs still he was safe
it was a swift descent but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom
the slide leveled out at the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge carnelian floor
when he finally came to a stop he was too dizzy to walk
his first attempt to stand made him nauseated so he curled up head in his hands and waited for things to stop spinning
when he felt better he stood and warily looked around
the great chamber was completely deserted the silence unsettling
rosy light filtered down from isidar mithrim
he faltered where was he supposed to go and cast out his mind for the twins
nothing
he froze as loud knocking echoed through tronjheim
an explosion split the air
a long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet up
needles of rocks flew outward as it crashed down
eragon stumbled back stunned groping for zar roc
the twisted shapes of urgals clambered out of the hole in the floor
eragon hesitated
should he flee or should he stay and try to close the tunnel even if he managed to seal it before the urgals attacked him what if tronjheim was already breached elsewhere he could not find all the places in time to prevent the city mountain from being ** if i run to one of tronjheim is gates and blast it open the varden could retake tronjheim without having to siege it
before he could decide a tall man garbed entirely in black armor emerged from the tunnel and looked directly at him
the shade carried his pale blade marked with the scratch from ajihad
a black roundshield with a crimson ensign rested on his arm
his dark helmet was richly decorated like a general is and a long snakeskin cloak billowed around him
madness burned in his maroon eyes the madness of one who enjoys power and finds himself in the position to use it
eragon knew he was neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him
he immediately warned saphira though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue him
he dropped into a crouch and quickly reviewed what brom had told him about fighting another magic user
it was not encouraging
and ajihad had said that shades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart
durza gazed at him contemptuously and said kaz jtierl ** otrag ** the urgals eyed eragon suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room
durza slowly approached eragon with a triumphant expression
so my young rider we meet again
you were foolish to escape from me in gil ead
it will only make things worse for you in the end
you will never capture me alive growled eragon
is that so asked the shade raising an eyebrow
the light from the star sapphire gave his skin a ghastly tint
i do not see your friend murtagh around to help you
you can not stop me now
no one **
fear touched ** does he know about murtagh putting all the derision he could into his voice he jeered how did you like being shot
durza is face tightened momentarily
i will be repaid in blood for that
now tell me where your dragon is hiding
