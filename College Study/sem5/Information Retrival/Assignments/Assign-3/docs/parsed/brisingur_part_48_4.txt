never ** oromis paused and his expression softened
losing her was i think almost as difficult for brom as losing his dragon and it quenched much of the fire within his soul
he did not give up though nor did he go mad as he had for a time when the forsworn slew saphira is namesake
instead he decided to discover the reason for your mother is death and to punish those who were responsible if he could
he questioned morzan is healers and forced them to describe your mother is ailments
from what they said and also from gossip he heard among the servants on the estate brom guessed the truth about your mother is pregnancy
possessed of that hope he rode to the one place he knew to look your mother is home in carvahall
and there he found you in the care of your aunt and uncle
brom did not stay in carvahall however
as soon as he assured himself that no one in carvahall knew your mother had been the black hand and that you were in no imminent danger brom returned in secret to farthen dur where he revealed himself to deynor who was the leader of the varden at that time
deynor was astounded to see him for until that moment everyone had believed that brom had perished in gil ead
brom convinced deynor to keep his presence a secret from all but a select few and then
eragon raised a finger
but why why pretend to be dead
brom wanted to live long enough to help instruct the new rider and he knew the only way he could avoid being assassinated in retaliation for killing morzan would be if galbatorix believed he was already dead and buried
also brom hoped to avoid attracting unwarranted attention to carvahall
he intended to settle there in order to be close to you as indeed he did but he was determined that the empire should not learn of your existence as a result
while in farthen dur brom helped the varden negotiate the agreement with queen islanzadi over how the elves and the humans would share custody of the egg and how the new rider would be trained if and when the egg should hatch
then brom accompanied arya as she carried the egg from farthen dur to ellesmera
when he arrived he told glaedr and me what i have now told you so that the truth about your parentage would not be forgotten if he should die
that was the last time i ever saw him
from here brom returned to carvahall where he introduced himself as a bard and storyteller
what happened thereafter you know better than i
oromis fell silent and for a time no one spoke
staring at the ground eragon reviewed everything oromis had told him and tried to sort out his feelings
at last he said and brom really is my father not morzan i mean if my mother was morzan is consort then
he trailed off too embarrassed to continue
you are your father is son oromis said and your father is brom
of that there is no doubt
a sense of giddiness gripped eragon and he realized he had been holding his breath
exhaling he said i think i understand why he paused to fill his lungs why brom did not say anything about this before i found saphira is egg but why did not he tell me afterward and why did he swear you and saphira to such secrecy
did not he want to claim me as his son was he ashamed of me
i cannot pretend to know the reasons for everything brom did eragon
however of this much i am confident brom wanted nothing more than to name you his son and to raise you but he dared not reveal that you were related lest the empire should find out and try to hurt him through you
his prudence was warranted too
look how galbatorix strove to capture your cousin so that he could use roran to force you to surrender
brom could have told my uncle eragon protested
garrow would not have betrayed brom to the empire
think eragon
if you had been living with brom and if word of brom is survival had reached the ears of galbatorix is spies you both would have had to flee carvahall for fear of your lives
by keeping the truth hidden from you brom hoped to protect you from those dangers
he did not succeed
we had to flee carvahall anyway
yes said oromis
brom is mistake as it were although i judge it has yielded more good than ill was that he could not bear to separate himself entirely from you
