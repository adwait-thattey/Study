perhaps they re the last of a dying race
you see they are the king is personal dragon hunters
whenever rumors reach galbatorix of a dragon in the land he sends the ra zac to investigate
a trail of death often follows ** brom blew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles
eragon ignored the rings until he noticed that they were changing color and darting around
brom winked slyly
eragon was sure that no one had seen saphira so how could galbatorix have heard about her when he voiced his objections brom said you re right it seems unlikely that anyone from carvahall could have informed the king
why do not you tell me where you got the egg and how you raised saphira that might clarify the issue
eragon hesitated then recounted all the events since he had found the egg in the spine
it felt wonderful to finally confide in someone
brom asked a few questions but most of the time he listened intently
the sun was about to set when eragon finished his tale
both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a soft pink
eragon eventually broke the silence
i just wish i knew where she came from
and saphira does not remember
brom cocked his head
i do not know
you ve made many things clear to me
i am sure that no one besides us has seen saphira
the ra zac must have had a source of information outside of this valley one who is probably dead by now
you have had a hard time and done much
i am impressed
eragon stared blankly into the distance then asked what happened to your head it looks like you were hit with a rock
no but that is a good ** he took a deep pull on the pipe
i was sneaking around the ra zac is camp after dark trying to learn what i could when they surprised me in the shadows
it was a good trap but they underestimated me and i managed to drive them away
not however he said wryly without this token of my stupidity
stunned i fell to the ground and did not regain consciousness until the next day
by then they had already arrived at your farm
it was too late to stop them but i set out after them anyway
that is when we met on the road
who is he to think that he could take on the ra zac alone they ambushed him in the dark and he was only stunned unsettled eragon asked hotly when you saw the mark the gedwey ignasia on my palm why did not you tell me who the ra zac were i would have warned garrow instead of going to saphira first and the three of us could have fled
brom sighed
i was unsure of what to do at the time
i thought i could keep the ra zac away from you and once they had left confront you about saphira
but they outsmarted me
it is a mistake that i deeply regret and one that has cost you dearly
who are you demanded eragon suddenly bitter
how come a mere village storyteller happens to have a rider is sword how do you know about the ra zac
brom tapped his pipe
i thought i made it clear i was not going to talk about that
my uncle is dead because of ** exclaimed eragon slashing a hand through the air
i ve trusted you this far because saphira respects you but no ** you re not the person i ve known in carvahall for all of these years
explain **
for a long time brom stared at the smoke swirling between them deep lines creasing his forehead
when he stirred it was only to take another puff
finally he said you ve probably never thought about it but most of my life has been spent outside of palancar valley
it was only in carvahall that i took up the mantle of storyteller
i have played many roles to different people i ve a complicated past
it was partly through a desire to escape it that i came here
so no i am not the man you think i am
** snorted eragon
then who are you
brom smiled gently
i am one who is here to help you
do not scorn those words they are the truest i ve ever spoken
but i am not going to answer your questions
at this point you do not need to hear my history nor have you yet earned that right
yes i have knowledge brom the storyteller would not but i am more than he
you will have to learn to live with that fact and the fact that i do not hand out descriptions of my life to anyone who **
