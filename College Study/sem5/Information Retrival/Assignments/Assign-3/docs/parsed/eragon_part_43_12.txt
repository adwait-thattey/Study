with a pang eragon remembered how brom had taught him to read
he wondered if he still had the skill
a long time had passed since he had seen any written words
yes let is do that
after they ate orik guided eragon through myriad corridors to their destination
when they reached the library is carved arch eragon stepped through it reverently
the room reminded him of a forest
rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark ribbed ceiling five stories above
between the pillars black marble bookcases stood back to back
racks of scrolls covered the walls interspersed with narrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases
placed at regular intervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches
between them were small tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor
countless books and scrolls were stored in the room
this is the true legacy of our race said orik
here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars from antiquity to the present
also recorded are the songs and stories composed by our artisans
this library may be our most precious possession
it is not all our work though there are human writings here as well
yours is a short lived but prolific race
we have little or nothing of the elves
they guard their secrets jealously
how long may i stay asked eragon moving toward the shelves
as long as you want
come to me if you have any questions
eragon browsed through the volumes with delight reaching eagerly for those with interesting titles or covers
surprisingly dwarves used the same runes to write as humans
he was somewhat disheartened by how hard reading was after months of neglect
he skipped from book to book slowly working his way deep into the vast library
eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by dondar the tenth dwarf king
as he scanned the graceful lines unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase
the sound startled him but he berated himself for being silly he could not be the only person in the library
even so he quietly replaced the book and slipped away senses alert for danger
he had been ambushed too many times to ignore such feelings
he heard the footsteps again only now there were two sets of them
apprehensive he darted across an opening trying to remember exactly where orik was sitting
he sidestepped around a corner and started as he found himself face to face with the twins
the twins stood together their shoulders meeting a blank expression on their smooth faces
their black snake eyes bored into him
their hands hidden within the folds of their purple robes twitched slightly
they both bowed but the movement was insolent and derisive
we have been searching for you one said
his voice was uncomfortably like the ra zac is
eragon suppressed a shiver
what for he reached out with his mind and contacted saphira
she immediately joined thoughts with him
ever since you met with ajihad we have wanted to
apologize for our ** the words were mocking but not in a way eragon could challenge
we have come to pay homage to ** eragon flushed angrily as they bowed again
he pushed back his rising temper
he could not afford to be riled by this confrontation
an idea came to him and he said with a small smile nay it is i who pay homage to you
without your approval i never could have gained entrance to farthen ** he bowed to them in turn making the movement as insulting as he could
there was a flicker of irritation in the twins eyes but they smiled and said we are honored that one so
important
as yourself thinks so highly of us
we are in your debt for your kind words
now it was eragon is turn to be irritated
i will remember that when i am in need
saphira intruded sharply in his ** re overdoing ** not say anything you will regret
they will remember every word they can use against you
this is difficult enough without you making ** snapped
she subsided with an exasperated grumble
the twins moved closer the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor
their voices became more pleasant
we have searched for you for another reason as well rider
