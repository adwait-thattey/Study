so then said eragon galbatorix captured the eldunari
contrary to eragon is expectations it was oromis who replied
he did but not all at once
it had been so long since anyone had truly threatened the riders many of our order had become careless about protecting the eldunari
at the time galbatorix turned against us it was not uncommon for a rider is dragon to disgorge their eldunari merely for the sake of convenience
anyone who holds one of our hearts said glaedr may communicate with the dragon from which it came without regard for distance
the whole of alagaesia might separate a rider and dragon and yet if the rider had with him his dragon is eldunari they could share thoughts as easily as you and saphira do now
in addition said oromis a magician who possesses an eldunari can draw upon the dragon is strength to bolster his spells again without regard for where the dragon might be
when
a brilliantly colored hummingbird interrupted their conversation by darting across the table
its wings a throbbing blur the bird hovered over the bowls of fruit and lapped at the liquid oozing from a crushed blackberry then flitted up and away vanishing among the trunks of the forest
oromis resumed speaking when galbatorix killed his first rider he also stole the heart of the rider is dragon
during the years galbatorix spent hiding in the wilderness thereafter he broke the dragon is mind and bent it to his will likely with the help of durza
and when galbatorix began his insurrection in earnest with morzan by his side he was already stronger than most every other rider
his strength was not merely magical but mental for the force of the eldunari is consciousness augmented his own
galbatorix did not just try to kill the riders and dragons
he made it his goal to acquire as many of the eldunari as he could either by seizing them from riders or by torturing a rider until his dragon disgorged its heart of hearts
by the time we realized what galbatorix was doing he was already too powerful to stop
it helped galbatorix that many riders traveled not only with the eldunari of their own dragon but also with eldunari of dragons whose bodies were no more for such dragons often became bored with sitting in an alcove and yearned for adventure
and of course once galbatorix and the forsworn sacked the city of doru araeba on the island of vroengard he gained possession of the entire hoard of eldunari stored therein
galbatorix engineered his success by using the might and wisdom of the dragons against all of alagaesia
at first he was unable to control more than a handful of the eldunari he had captured
it is no easy thing to force a dragon to submit to you no matter how powerful you might be
as soon as galbatorix crushed the riders and had installed himself as king in uru baen he dedicated himself to subduing the rest of the hearts one by one
we believe the task preoccupied him for the main part of the next forty years during which time he paid little attention to the affairs of alagaesia which is why the people of surda were able to secede from the empire
when he finished galbatorix emerged from seclusion and began to reassert his control over the empire and the lands beyond
for some reason after two and a half years of additional slaughter and sorrow he withdrew to uru baen again and there he has dwelt ever since not so solitary as before but obviously focused upon some project known only to him
his vices are many but he has not abandoned himself to debauchery that much the varden is spies have determined
more than that though we have not been able to discover
lost deep in thought eragon stared off into the distance
for the first time all of the stories he had heard about galbatorix is unnatural power made sense
a faint feeling of optimism welled up within eragon as he said to himself i am not sure how but if we could release the eldunari from galbatorix is control he would be no more powerful than any normal dragon rider
unlikely as the prospect seemed it heartened eragon to know that the king did have a vulnerability no matter how slight
