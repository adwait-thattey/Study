in their right hands the dwarves held long sharp daggers with pale blades that flickered with prismatic colors while in their left each carried a metal buckler with a sharpened spike protruding from the boss
their minds like those of the ra zac were hidden from eragon
** was eragon is first thought
then he remembered he was alone
twisting to face the black garbed dwarves eragon reached for the hilt of his falchion while opening his mouth to shout a warning
as the first word rang in his throat three of the strange dwarves grabbed the hindmost of eragon is guards and lifted their glimmering daggers to stab him
faster than speech or conscious thought eragon plunged his whole being into the flow of magic and without relying upon the ancient language to structure his spell rewove the fabric of the world into a pattern more pleasing to him
the three guards who stood between him and the attackers flew toward him as if yanked by invisible strings and landed upon their feet beside him unharmed but disoriented
eragon winced at the sudden decrease in his strength
two of the black garbed dwarves rushed him stabbing at his belly with their blood hungry daggers
sword in hand eragon parried both blows stunned by the dwarves speed and ferocity
one of his guards leaped forward shouting and swinging his ax at the would be assassins
before eragon could grab the dwarf is hauberk and yank him back to safety a white blade writhing as with spectral flame pierced the dwarf is corded neck
as the dwarf fell eragon glimpsed his contorted face and was shocked to see kvistor and that his throat was glowing molten red as it disintegrated around the dagger
i can not let them so much as scratch me eragon thought
enraged by kvistor is death eragon stabbed at his killer so quickly the black garbed dwarf had no opportunity to evade the blow and dropped lifeless at eragon is feet
with all his strength eragon shouted stay behind **
thin cracks split the floors and walls and flakes of stone fell from the ceiling as his voice reverberated through the corridor
the attacking dwarves faltered at the unbridled power of his voice then resumed their offensive
eragon retreated several yards to give himself room to maneuver free of the corpses and settled into a low crouch waving the falchion to and fro like a snake preparing to strike
his heart was racing at twice its normal rate and although the fight had just begun he was already gasping for breath
the hallway was eight feet wide which was wide enough for three of his six remaining enemies to attack him at once
they spread out two attempting to flank him on the right and the left while the third charged straight at him slashing with frenzied speed at eragon is arms and legs
afraid to duel with the dwarves as he would have if they wielded normal blades eragon drove his legs against the floor and jumped up and forward
he spun halfway around and struck the ceiling feetfirst
he pushed off spun halfway around again and landed on his hands and feet a yard behind the three dwarves
even as they whirled toward him he stepped forward and beheaded the lot of them with a single backhand blow
their daggers clattered against the floor an instant before their heads
leaping over their truncated bodies eragon twisted in midair and landed on the spot he had started from
he was not a moment too soon
a breath of wind tickled his neck as the tip of a dagger whipped past his throat
another blade tugged at the cuff of his leggings cutting them open
he flinched and swung the falchion trying to gain space to fight
my wards should have turned their blades ** he thought bewildered
an involuntary cry escaped his throat as his foot struck a patch of slick blood and he lost his balance and toppled over backward
with a sickening crunch his head collided with the stone floor
blue lights flashed before his eyes
he gasped
his three remaining guards sprang over him and swung their axes in unison clearing the air above eragon and saving him from the bite of the flashing daggers
that was all the time eragon needed to recover
