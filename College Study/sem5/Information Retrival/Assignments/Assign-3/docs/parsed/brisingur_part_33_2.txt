that or i will have to finish what galbatorix started
i refuse to live my entire life in fear of az sweldn rak anhuin
again as he had done so often in the past few days he waited a moment for saphira is response and when it was not forthcoming a familiar pang of unhappiness lanced his heart
how secure the alliances between any of the clans were however was a question of some uncertainty
neither orik nor iorunn nor gannel nor nado had enough support to win a popular vote so they were all actively engaged in trying to retain the loyalties of the clans who had already promised to help them while at the same time trying to poach their opponents backers
despite the importance of the process eragon found it exceedingly tedious and frustrating
based upon orik is explanation it was eragon is understanding that before the clan chiefs could elect a ruler they had to vote on whether they were prepared to choose a new king or queen and that the preliminary election had to garner at least nine votes in its favor if it was to pass
as of yet none of the clan chiefs orik included felt secure enough in their positions to bring the matter to a head and proceed to the final election
it was as orik had said the most delicate part of the process and in some instances had been known to drag on for a frustratingly long time
as he pondered the situation eragon wandered aimlessly through the warren of chambers below tronjheim until he found himself in a dry dusty room lined with five black arches on one side and a bas relief carving of a snarling bear twenty feet high on the other
the bear had gold teeth and round faceted rubies for eyes
where are we kvistor asked eragon glancing at his guards
his voice spawned hollow echoes in the room
eragon could sense the minds of many of the dwarves in the levels above them but he had no idea how to reach them
the lead guard a youngish dwarf no older than sixty stepped forward
these rooms were cleared millennia ago by grimstnzborith korgan when tronjheim was under construction
we have not used them much since except when our entire race congregates in farthen dur
eragon nodded
can you lead me back to the surface
several minutes of brisk walking brought them to a broad staircase with shallow dwarf sized steps that climbed out of the ground to a passageway somewhere in the southwestern quadrant of tronjheim is base
from there kvistor guided eragon to the southern branch of the four mile long hallways that divided tronjheim along the cardinal compass points
it was the same hallway through which eragon and saphira had first entered tronjheim several months ago and eragon walked down it toward the center of the city mountain with a strange sense of nostalgia
he felt as if he had aged several years in the interim
the four story high avenue thronged with dwarves from every clan
all of them noticed eragon of that he was sure but not all deigned to acknowledge him for which he was grateful as it saved him the effort of having to return even more greetings
eragon stiffened as he saw a line of az sweldn rak anhuin cross the hallway
as one the dwarves turned their heads and looked at him their expressions obscured behind the purple veils those of their clan always wore in public
the last dwarf in line spat on the floor toward eragon before filing through an archway and out of the hall along with his or her brethren
if saphira were here they would not dare to be so rude thought eragon
a half hour later he reached the end of the majestic hallway and although he had been there many times before a sense of awe and wonder overwhelmed him as he stepped between the pillars of black onyx topped with yellow zircons thrice the size of a man and entered the circular chamber in the heart of tronjheim
the chamber was a thousand feet from side to side with a floor of polished carnelian etched with a hammer surrounded by twelve pentacles which was the crest of durgrimst ingeitum and of the dwarves first king korgan who had discovered farthen dur while mining for gold
opposite eragon and to either side were the openings to the three other halls that radiated out through the citymountain
