galbatorix has constructed a depraved imitation of the relationship that you eragon and you saphira possess and that he lost when the urgals murdered his original dragon
glaedr paused and looked between the two of them
his eye was all that ** which links you exceeds any simple connection between minds
your very souls your identities call it what you will have been welded on a primal level
his eye flicked to ** you believe that a person is soul is separate from his body
i do not know said eragon
saphira once took me out of my body and let me see the world through her eyes
itseemed like i was no longer connected to my body
and if the wraiths that a sorcerer calls upon can exist then maybe our consciousness is independent of flesh as well
extending the needle sharp tip of his foreclaw glaedr flipped over a rock to expose a woodrat cowering in its nest
he snapped up the rat with a flash of his red tongue eragon winced as he felt the animal is life extinguished
when the flesh is destroyed so is the soul said glaedr
but an animal is not a person protested eragon
after your meditations do you truly believe that any of us are so different from a woodrat that we are gifted with a miraculous quality that other creatures do not enjoy and that somehow preserves our beings after death
i thought not
because we are so closely joined when a dragon or rider is injured they must harden their hearts and sever the connection between them in order to protect each other from unnecessary suffering even insanity
and since the soul cannot be torn from the flesh you must resist the temptation to try to take your partner is soul into your own body and shelter it there as that will result in both your deaths
even if it were possible it would be an abomination to have multiple consciousnesses in one body
how terrible said eragon to die alone separate even from the one who is closest to you
everyone dies alone eragon
whether you are a king on a battlefield or a lowly peasant lying in bed among your family no one can accompany you into the void
now i will have you practice separating your consciousnesses
start by
eragon stared at the tray of dinner left in the anteroom of the tree house
he cataloged the contents bread with hazelnut butter berries beans a bowl of leafy greens two hard boiled eggs which in accordance with the elves beliefs were unfertilized and a stoppered jug of fresh spring water
he knew that each dish was prepared with the utmost care that the elves lavished all of their culinary skill upon his meals and that not even islanzadi ate better than him
he could not bear the sight of the tray
i want meat he growled stomping back into the bedroom
saphira looked up at him from her ** d even settle for fish or fowl anything besides this never ending stream of vegetables
they do not fill up my stomach
i am not a horse why should i be fed like one
saphira unfolded her legs walked to the edge of the teardrop gap overlooking ellesmera and said i have needed to eat these past few days
would you like to join me you can cook as much meat as you like and the elves will never know
that i would he said ** i get the saddle
eragon fetched his supply of salt herbs and other seasonings from his bags and then careful not to overexert himself climbed into the gap between the spikes along saphira is spine
launching herself off the ground saphira let an updraft waft her high above the city whereupon she glided off the column of warm air slipping down and sideways as she followed a braided stream through du weldenvarden to a pond some miles thence
she landed and hunched low to the ground making it easier for eragon to dismount
she said there are rabbits in the grass by the edge of the water
see if you can catch them
in the meantime i go to hunt deer
what you do not want to share your own prey
no i do not she replied ** i will if those oversized mice elude you
he grinned as she took off then faced the tangled clumps of grass and cow parsnip that surrounded the pond and set about procuring his dinner
less than a minute later eragon collected a brace of dead rabbits from their nest
