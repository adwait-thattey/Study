the tip of thorn is nose twitched as he sniffed at saphira
she sniffed him in return and her tongue darted out of her mouth as she tasted his scent
pity for thorn welled up inside eragon and saphira together and they wished they could speak with him directly but they dared not open their minds to him
with so little distance between them eragon noticed the bundles of cords that ridged murtagh is neck and the forked vein that pulsed in the middle of his forehead
i am not ** said murtagh
i ve done the best i could under the circumstances
i doubt you would have survived as well as i did if our mother had seen fit to leave you in uru baen and hide me in carvahall
murtagh banged his breastplate with his fist
** then how am i supposed to follow your advice if i am already a good man if i have already done as well as could be expected how can i change must i become worse than i am must i embrace galbatorix is darkness in order to free myself of it that hardly seems like a reasonable solution
if i succeeded in so altering my identity you would not like who i had become and you would curse me as strongly as you curse galbatorix now
frustrated eragon said yes but you do not have to become better or worse than you are now only different
there are many kinds of people in the world and many ways to behave honorably
look at someone whom you admire but who has chosen paths other than your own through life and model your actions upon his
it may take a while but if you can shift your personality enough you can leave galbatorix and you can leave the empire and you and thorn could join us in the varden where you would be free to do as you wish
what of your own oaths to avenge hrothgar is death saphira asked
eragon ignored her
murtagh sneered at him
so you are asking me to be that which i am not
if thorn and i are to save ourselves we must destroy our current identities
your cure is worse than our affliction
i am asking you to allow yourself to grow into something other than you are now
it is a difficult thing to do i know but people remake themselves all the time
let go of your anger for one and you can turn your back on galbatorix once and for all
let go of my anger murtagh laughed
i will let go of my anger when you forget yours over the empire is role in the death of your uncle and the razing of your farm
anger defines us eragon and without it you and i would be a feast for maggots
still
his eyes half lidded murtagh tapped zar roc is crossguard the cords in his neck softening although the vein that split his forehead remained swollen as ever
the concept is intriguing i admit
perhaps we can work on it together when we are in uru baen
that is if the king permits us to be alone with each other
of course he may decide to keep us permanently separated
i would if i were in his position
eragon tightened his fingers around the hilt of the falchion
you seem to think we will accompany you to the capital
oh but you will ** a crooked smile stretched murtagh is mouth
even if we wanted to thorn and i could not change who we are in an instant
until such time as we may have that opportunity we shall remain beholden to galbatorix and he has ordered us in no uncertain terms to bring him the two of you
neither of us is willing to brave the king is displeasure again
we defeated you once before
it will be no great achievement to do so again
a spurt of flame escaped from between saphira is teeth and eragon had to stifle a similar response in words
if he lost control of his temper now bloodshed would be unavoidable
please murtagh thorn will you not at least try what i ve suggested have you no desire to resist galbatorix you will never cast off your chains unless you are willing to defy him
you underestimate galbatorix eragon growled murtagh
he has been creating name slaves for over a hundred years ever since he recruited our father
do you think he is unaware that a person is true name may vary over the course of his life he is sure to have taken precautions against that eventuality
if my true name were to change this very moment or thorn is most likely it would trigger a spell that would alert galbatorix to the change and force us to return to him in uru baen so he could bind us to him again
