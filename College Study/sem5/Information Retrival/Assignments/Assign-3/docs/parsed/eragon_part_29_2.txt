brom was on her back as eragon had seen but his sword was now bloody
brom is face was contorted the edges of his beard were stained red
what happened asked eragon afraid that he had been wounded
what happened roared the old man
i ve been trying to clean up your ** he slashed the air with the sword flinging drops of blood along its arc
do you know what you did with that little trick of yours do you
i stopped the urgals from catching you said eragon a pit forming in his stomach
yes growled brom but that piece of magic nearly killed ** you ve been sleeping for two days
there were twelve ** but that did not stop you from trying to throw them all the way to teirm now did it what were you thinking sending a rock through each of their heads would have been the smart thing to do
but no you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later
i ve spent the last two days trying to track them down
even with saphira three **
i did not want to kill them said eragon feeling very small
it was not a problem in yazuac
there was no choice then and i could not control the magic
this time it just seemed
extreme
** cried brom
it is not extreme when they would not show you the same mercy
and why oh why did youshow yourself to them
you said that they had found saphira is footprints
it did not make any difference if they saw me said eragon defensively
brom stabbed his sword into the dirt and snapped i said they hadprobably found her tracks
we did not know for certain
they might have believed they were chasing some stray travelers
but why would they think that now after all you landed right in front of ** and since you let them live they re scrambling around the countryside with all sorts of fantastic ** this might even get back to the ** he threw his hands up
you do not even deserve to be called a rider after this boy
brom yanked his sword out of the ground and stomped to the fire
he took a rag from inside his robe and angrily began to clean the blade
eragon was stunned
he tried to ask saphira for advice but all she would say was speak with brom
hesitantly eragon made his way to the fire and asked would it help if i said i was sorry
brom sighed and sheathed his sword
no it would not
your feelings can not change what ** he jabbed his finger at eragon is chest
you made some very bad choices that could have dangerous repercussions
not the least of which is that you almost died
died ** from now on you re going to have to think
there is a reason why we re born with brains in our heads not rocks
eragon nodded abashed
it is not as bad as you think though the urgals already knew about me
they had orders to capture me
astonishment widened brom is eyes
he stuck his unlit pipe in his mouth
no it is not as bad as i thought
it is ** saphira told me you had talked with the urgals but she did not mention ** the words tumbled out of eragon is mouth as he quickly described the confrontation
so they have some sort of leader now eh questioned brom
and you just defied his wishes insulted him and attacked his men brom shook his head
i did not think it could get any worse
if the urgals had been killed your rudeness would have gone unnoticed but now it will be impossible to ignore
congratulations you just made enemies with one of the most powerful beings in alagaesia
all right i made a mistake said eragon sullenly
yes you did agreed brom eyes flashing
what has me worried though is who this urgal leader is
shivering eragon asked softly what happens now
there was an uncomfortable pause
your arm is going to take at least a couple of weeks to heal
that time would be well spent forging some sense into you
i suppose this is partially my fault
i ve been teaching youhow to do things but not whether youshould
it takes discretion something you obviously lack
all the magic in alagaesia wo not help you if you do not know when to use it
but we re still going to dras leona right asked eragon
brom rolled his eyes
yes we can keep looking for the ra zac but even if we find them it wo not do any good until you ve ** he began unsaddling saphira
are you well enough to ride
