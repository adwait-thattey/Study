it seems both a blessing and a curse
aye
i cannot in good conscience marry a woman who will age and die while i remain untouched by time such an experience would be equally cruel for both of us
on top of that i find the thought of taking one wife after another throughout the long centuries rather depressing
can you make someone immortal with magic asked roran
you can darken white hair you can smooth wrinkles and remove cataracts and if you are willing to go to extraordinary lengths you can give a sixty year old man the body he had at nineteen
however the elves have never discovered a way to restore a person is mind without destroying his or her memories
and who wants to erase their identity every so many decades in exchange for immortality it would be a stranger then who lived on
an old brain in a young body is not the answer either for even with the best of health that which we humans are made of can only last for a century perhaps a bit more
nor can you just stop someone from aging
that causes a whole host of other problems
oh elves and men have tried a thousand and one different ways to foil death but none have proved successful
in other words said roran it is safer for you to love arya than to leave your heart free for the taking by a human woman
who else can i marry but an elf especially considering how i look ** eragon quelled the desire to reach up and finger the curved tips of his ears a habit he had fallen into
when i lived in ellesmera it was easy for me to accept how the dragons had changed my appearance
after all they gave me many gifts besides
also the elves were friendlier toward me after the agaeti blodhren
it was only when i rejoined the varden that i realized how different i ve become
it bothers me too
i am no longer just human and i am not quite an elf
i am something else in between a mix a halfbreed
cheer ** said roran
you may not have to worry about living forever
galbatorix murtagh the ra zac or even one of the empire is soldiers could put steel through us at any moment
a wise man would ignore the future and drink and carouse while he still has an opportunity to enjoy this world
i know what father would say to that
and he d give us a good hiding to boot
they shared a laugh and then the silence that so often intruded on their discussion asserted itself once again a gap born of equal parts weariness familiarity and conversely the many differences that fate had created between those who had once gone about lives that were but variations on a single melody
you should sleep said saphira to eragon and roran
it is late and we must rise early tomorrow
eragon looked at the black vault of the sky judging the hour by how far the stars had rotated
the night was older than he expected
sound advice he said
i just wish we had a few more days to rest before we storm helgrind
the battle on the burning plains drained all of saphira is strength and my own and we have not fully recovered what with flying here and the energy i transferred into the belt of beloth the wise these past two evenings
my limbs still ache and i have more bruises than i can count
look
loosening the ties on the cuff of his left shirtsleeve he pushed back the soft lamarae a fabric the elves made by cross weaving wool and nettle threads revealing a rancid yellow streak where his shield had mashed against his forearm
** said roran
you call that tiny little mark a bruise i hurt myself worse when i bumped my toe this morning
here i will show you a bruise a man can be proud ** he unlaced his left boot pulled it off and rolled up the leg of his trousers to expose a black stripe as wide as eragon is thumb that slanted across his quadriceps
i caught the haft of a spear as a soldier was turning about
impressive but i have even ** ducking out of his tunic eragon yanked his shirt free of his trousers and twisted to the side so that roran could see the large blotch on his ribs and the similar discoloration on his belly
arrows he explained
then he uncovered his right forearm revealing a bruise that matched the one on his other arm given when he had deflected a sword with his bracer
