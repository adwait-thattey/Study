murtagh shook his head stubbornly
no
even if i were to submit i would still be treated like a leper and an outcast
all i wish is to leave
if you let me do that peacefully i will never reveal your location to the empire
what will happen if you are captured and brought before galbatorix demanded ajihad
he will extract every secret from your mind no matter how strong you may be
even if you could resist him how can we trust that you wo not rejoin him in the future i cannot take that chance
will you hold me prisoner forever demanded murtagh straightening
no said ajihad only until you let yourself be examined
if you are found trustworthy the twins will remove all knowledge of farthen dur is location from your mind before you leave
we wo not risk someone with those memories falling into galbatorix is hands
what is it to be murtagh decide quickly or else the path will be chosen for you
just give in eragon pleaded silently concerned for murtagh is ** is not worth the fight
finally murtagh spoke the words slow and distinct
my mind is the one sanctuary that has not been stolen from me
men have tried to breach it before but i ve learned to defend it vigorously for i am only safe with my innermost thoughts
you have asked for the one thing i cannot give least of all to those ** he gestured at the twins
do with me what you will but know this death will take me before i will expose myself to their probing
admiration glinted in ajihad is eyes
i am not surprised by your choice though i had hoped otherwise
** the cedar door slammed open as warriors rushed in weapons ready
ajihad pointed at murtagh and commanded take him to a windowless room and bar the door securely
post six men by the entrance and allow no one inside until i come to see him
do not speak to him either
the warriors surrounded murtagh watching him suspiciously
as they left the study eragon caught murtagh is attention and mouthed i am ** murtagh shrugged then stared forward resolutely
he vanished into the hallway with the men
the sound of their feet faded into silence
ajihad said abruptly i want everyone out of this room but eragon and saphira
**
bowing the twins departed but orik said sir the king will want to know of murtagh
and there is still the matter of my insubordination
ajihad frowned then waved his hand
i will tell hrothgar myself
as for your actions
wait outside until i call for you
and do not let the twins get away
i am not done with them either
very well said orik inclining his head
he closed the door with a solid thump
after a long silence ajihad sat with a tired sigh
he ran a hand over his face and stared at the ceiling
eragon waited impatiently for him to speak
when nothing was forthcoming he blurted is arya all right
ajihad looked down at him and said gravely no
but the healers tell me she will recover
they worked on her all through the night
the poison took a dreadful toll on her
she would not have lived if not for you
for that you have the varden is deepest thanks
eragon is shoulders slumped with relief
for the first time he felt that their flight from gil ead had been worth the effort
so what now he asked
i need you to tell me how you found saphira and everything that is happened since said ajihad forming a steeple with his fingers
some of it i know from the message brom sent us other parts from the twins
but i want to hear it from you especially the details concerning brom is death
eragon was reluctant to share his experiences with a stranger but ajihad was ** on urged saphira gently
eragon shifted then began his story
it was awkward at first but grew easier as he proceeded
saphira helped him to remember things clearly with occasional comments
ajihad listened intently the entire time
eragon talked for hours often pausing between his words
he told ajihad of teirm though he kept angela is fortunetelling to himself and how he and brom had found the ra zac
he even related his dreams of arya
when he came to gil ead and mentioned the shade ajihad is face hardened and he leaned back with veiled eyes
when his narrative was complete eragon fell silent brooding on all that had occurred
