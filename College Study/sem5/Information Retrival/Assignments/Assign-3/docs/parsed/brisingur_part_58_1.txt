eragon is limbs grew heavy as saphira pulled out of the dive
then she leveled out and the weight pressing down on him vanished
like strange shrieking hawks arrows whistled past them some missing their mark while eragon is wards deflected the rest
swooping low over the outer city walls saphira roared again and lashed out with her claws and tail knocking groups of screaming men off the parapet and toward the hard ground eighty feet below
a tall square tower armed with four ballistae stood at the far end of the southern wall
the huge crossbows fired twelve foot long javelins toward the varden massed before the city gates
inside the curtain wall eragon and saphira spotted a hundred or so soldiers gathered around a pair of warriors who stood with their backs pressed against the base of the tower desperately trying to fend off a thicket of thrusting blades
even in the gloom and from high above eragon recognized one of the warriors as arya
saphira leaped down from the parapet and landed in the midst of the soldiers crushing several men beneath her feet
the rest scattered screaming with fear and surprise
saphira roared frustrated that her prey was escaping and whipped her tail across the dirt flattening a dozen more soldiers
a man tried to run past her
fast as a striking snake she caught him between her jaws and shook her head snapping his spine
she disposed of another four in a similar manner
by then the remaining men had vanished among the buildings
eragon quickly pulled loose his leg straps then jumped to the ground
the additional weight of his armor drove him to one knee as he landed
he grunted and pushed himself up onto his feet
** cried arya running up to him
she was panting and drenched with sweat
her only armor was a padded jerkin and a light helm painted black so it would not cast unwanted reflections
welcome bjartskular
welcome shadeslayer purred blodhgarm from by her side his short fangs orange and glistening in the torchlight his yellow eyes glowing
the ruff of fur on the elf is back and neck stood on end which made him appear even fiercer than usual
both he and arya were stained with blood although eragon could not tell if the blood was theirs
arya shook her head and blodhgarm said a few scratches but nothing serious
what are you doing here without reinforcements asked saphira
the gates said arya gasping
for three days we ve tried to break them but they re impervious to magic and the battering ram has barely dented the wood
so i convinced nasuada to
when arya paused to regain her breath blodhgarm picked up the thread of her narrative
arya convinced nasuada to stage tonight is attack so that we could sneak into feinster without being noticed and open the gates from within
unfortunately we encountered a trio of spellcasters
they engaged us with their minds and prevented us from using magic while they summoned soldiers to overwhelm us with sheer numbers
while blodhgarm spoke eragon placed a hand on the chest of one of the dead soldiers and transferred what energy remained in the man is flesh into his own body and thence to saphira
where are the spellcasters now he asked proceeding to another corpse
blodhgarm is fur covered shoulders rose and fell
they seem to have taken fright at your appearance shur tugal
as well they should growled saphira
eragon drained the energy from three more soldiers and from the last he also took the man is round wooden shield
well then he said standing let us go open the gates for the varden shall we
yes and without delay said arya
she started forward then cast a sideways glance at eragon
you have a new ** it was not a question
he nodded
rhunon helped me to forge it
and what is the name of your weapon shadeslayer asked blodhgarm
eragon was about to answer when four soldiers ran out from the mouth of a dark alleyway spears lowered
in a single smooth motion he drew brisingr from its sheath and slashed through the haft of the lead man is spear and continuing with the blow decapitated the soldier
brisingr seemed to shimmer with savage delight
arya lunged forward and stabbed two of the other men before they could react while blodhgarm leaped sideways and tackled the last soldier killing him with his own dagger
