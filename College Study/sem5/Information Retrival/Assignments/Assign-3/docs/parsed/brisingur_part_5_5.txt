eragon feared that even if she prevailed the lethrblaka would maim her before she slew them
taking a quick breath eragon cast a single spell that contained every one of the twelve techniques of killing that oromis had taught him
he was careful to phrase the incantation as a series of processes so that if galbatorix is wards foiled him he could sever the flow of magic
otherwise the spell might consume his strength until he died
it was well he took the precaution
upon release of the spell eragon quickly became aware that the magic was having no effect upon the lethrblaka and he abandoned the assault
he had not expected to succeed with the traditional death words but he had to try on the slight chance galbatorix might have been careless or ignorant when he had placed wards upon the lethrblaka and their spawn
behind him roran shouted ** an instant later a sword thudded against his shield followed by the tinkle of rippling mail and the bell like peal of a second sword bouncing off roran is helm
eragon realized that his hearing must be improving
the ra zac struck again and again but each time their weapons glanced off roran is armor or missed his face and limbs by a hairsbreadth no matter how fast they swung their blades
roran was too slow to retaliate but neither could the ra zac harm him
they hissed with frustration and spewed a continuous stream of invectives which seemed all the more foul because of how the creatures hard clacking jaws mangled the language
eragon smiled
the cocoon of charms he had spun around roran had done its job
he hoped the invisible net of energy would hold until he could find a way to halt the lethrblaka
everything shivered and went gray around eragon as the two lethrblaka shrieked in unison
for a moment his resolve deserted him leaving him unable to move then he rallied and shook himself as a dog might casting off their fell influence
the sound reminded him of nothing so much as a pair of children screaming in pain
then eragon began to chant as fast as he could without mispronouncing the ancient language
each sentence he uttered and they were legion contained the potential to deliver instant death and each death was unique among its fellows
as he recited his improvised soliloquy saphira received another cut upon her left flank
in return she broke the wing of her assailant slashing the thin flight membrane into ribbons with her claws
a number of heavy impacts transmitted themselves from roran is back to eragon is as the ra zac hacked and stabbed in a lightning quick frenzy
the largest of the two ra zac began to edge around roran in order to attack eragon directly
and then amid the din of steel against steel and steel against wood and claws against stone there came the scrape of a sword sliding through mail followed by a wet crunch
roran yelled and eragon felt blood splash across the calf of his right leg
out of the corner of one eye eragon watched as a humpbacked figure leaped toward him extending its leaf bladed sword so as to impale him
the world seemed to contract around the thin narrow point the tip glittered like a shard of crystal each scratch a thread of quicksilver in the bright light of dawn
he only had time for one more spell before he would have to devote himself to stopping the ra zac from inserting the sword between his liver and kidneys
in desperation he gave up trying to directly harm the lethrblaka and instead cried garjzla **
it was a crude spell constructed in haste and poorly worded yet it worked
the bulbous eyes of the lethrblaka with the broken wing became a matched set of mirrors each a perfect hemisphere as eragon is magic reflected the light that otherwise would have entered the lethrblaka is pupils
blind the creature stumbled and flailed at the air in a vain attempt to hit saphira
eragon spun the hawthorn staff in his hands and knocked aside the ra zac is sword when it was less than an inch from his ribs
the ra zac landed in front of him and jutted out its neck
eragon recoiled as a short thick beak appeared from within the depths of its hood
