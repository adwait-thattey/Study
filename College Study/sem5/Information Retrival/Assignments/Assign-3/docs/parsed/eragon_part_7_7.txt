at ten he was tested as was the custom and it was found that great power resided in him
the riders accepted him as their own
through their training he passed exceeding all others in skill
gifted with a sharp mind and strong body he quickly took his place among the riders ranks
some saw his abrupt rise as dangerous and warned the others but the riders had grown arrogant in their power and ignored caution
alas sorrow was conceived that day
so it was that soon after his training was finished galbatorix took a reckless trip with two friends
far north they flew night and day and passed into the urgals remaining territory foolishly thinking their new powers would protect them
there on a thick sheet of ice unmelted even in summer they were ambushed in their sleep
though his friends and their dragons were butchered and he suffered great wounds galbatorix slew his attackers
tragically during the fight a stray arrow pierced his dragon is heart
without the arts to save her she died in his arms
then were the seeds of madness planted
the storyteller clasped his hands and looked around slowly shadows flickering across his worn face
the next words came like the mournful toll of a requiem
alone bereft of much of his strength and half mad with loss galbatorix wandered without hope in that desolate land seeking death
it did not come to him though he threw himself without fear against any living thing
urgals and other monsters soon fled from his haunted form
during this time he came to realize that the riders might grant him another dragon
driven by this thought he began the arduous journey on foot back through the spine
territory he had soared over effortlessly on a dragon is back now took him months to traverse
he could hunt with magic but oftentimes he walked in places where animals did not travel
thus when his feet finally left the mountains he was close to death
a farmer found him collapsed in the mud and summoned the riders
unconscious he was taken to their holdings and his body healed
he slept for four days
upon awakening he gave no sign of his fevered mind
when he was brought before a council convened to judge him galbatorix demanded another dragon
the desperation of the request revealed his dementia and the council saw him for what he truly was
denied his hope galbatorix through the twisted mirror of his madness came to believe it was the riders fault his dragon had died
night after night he brooded on that and formulated a plan to exact revenge
brom is words dropped to a mesmerizing whisper
he found a sympathetic rider and there his insidious words took root
by persistent reasoning and the use of dark secrets learned from a shade he inflamed the rider against their elders
together they treacherously lured and killed an elder
when the foul deed was done galbatorix turned on his ally and slaughtered him without warning
the riders found him then with blood dripping from his hands
a scream tore from his lips and he fled into the night
as he was cunning in his madness they could not find him
for years he hid in wastelands like a hunted animal always watching for pursuers
his atrocity was not forgotten but over time searches ceased
then through some ill fortune he met a young rider morzan strong of body but weak of mind
galbatorix convinced morzan to leave a gate unbolted in the citadel ilirea which is now called uru baen
through this gate galbatorix entered and stole a dragon hatchling
he and his new disciple hid themselves in an evil place where the riders dared not venture
there morzan entered into a dark apprenticeship learning secrets and forbidden magic that should never have been revealed
when his instruction was finished and galbatorix is black dragon shruikan was fully grown galbatorix revealed himself to the world with morzan at his side
together they fought any rider they met
with each kill their strength grew
twelve of the riders joined galbatorix out of desire for power and revenge against perceived wrongs
those twelve with morzan became the thirteen forsworn
the riders were unprepared and fell beneath the onslaught
