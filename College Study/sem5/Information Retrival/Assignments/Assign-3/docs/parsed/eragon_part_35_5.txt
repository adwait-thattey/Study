distressed eragon bent over saphira is ** are you hurt
my wings are pierced
one of the arrows did not go all the way through
it is still ** breathing was labored and heavy
how far can you take us
far ** clutched the elf tightly as they skimmed over gil ead then left the city behind and veered eastward soaring upward through the night
saphira drifted down to a clearing landed on the crest of a hill and rested her outstretched wings on the ground
eragon could feel her shaking beneath him
they were only a half league from gil ead
picketed in the clearing were snowfire and tornac who snorted nervously at saphira is arrival
eragon slid to the ground and immediately turned to saphira is injuries while murtagh readied the horses
unable to see well in the darkness eragon ran his hands blindly over saphira is wings
he found three places where arrows had punctured the thin membrane leaving bloody holes as thick around as his thumb
a small piece had also been torn out of the back edge of her left wing
she shivered when his fingers brushed the injuries
he tiredly healed the wounds with words from the ancient language
then he went to the arrow that was embedded in one of the large muscles of her flying arm
the arrowhead poked through its underside
warm blood dripped off it
eragon called murtagh over and instructed hold her wing down
i have to remove this ** he indicated where murtagh should ** will be painful he warned saphira but it will be over quickly
try not to struggle you will hurt us
she extended her neck and grabbed a tall sapling between her curved teeth
with a yank of her head she pulled the tree out of the ground and clamped it firmly in her ** am ready
okay said eragon
hold on he whispered to murtagh then broke off the head of the arrow
trying not cause any more damage he swiftly pulled the shaft out of saphira
as it left her muscle she threw back her head and whimpered past the tree in her mouth
her wing jerked involuntarily clipping murtagh under the chin and knocking him to the ground
with a growl saphira shook the tree spraying them with dirt before tossing it away
after eragon sealed the wound he helped murtagh up
she caught me by surprise admitted murtagh touching his scraped jaw
she did not mean to hit you assured eragon
he checked on the unconscious ** re going to have to carry her a bit longer he told ** can not take her on the horses and ride fast enough
flying should be easier for you now that the arrow is out
saphira dipped her ** will do it
thank you said eragon
he hugged her ** you did was incredible i will never forget it
her eyes ** will go now
he backed away as she flew up in a flurry of air the elf is hair streaming back
seconds later they were gone
eragon hurried to snowfire pulled himself into the saddle and galloped away with murtagh
while they rode eragon tried to remember what he knew about elves
they had long lives that fact was oft repeated although he knew not how long
they spoke the ancient language and many could use magic
after the riders fall elves had retreated into seclusion
none of them had been seen in the empire ** why is one here now and how did the empire manage to capture her if she can use magic she is probably drugged as i was
they traveled through the night not stopping even when their flagging strength began to slow them
they continued onward despite burning eyes and clumsy movements
behind them lines of torch bearing horsemen searched around gil ead for their trail
after many bleary hours dawn lightened the sky
by unspoken consent eragon and murtagh stopped the horses
we have to make camp said eragon wearily
i must sleep whether they catch us or not
agreed said murtagh rubbing his eyes
have saphira land
we will meet her
they followed saphira is directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a small cliff the elf still slouched on her back
saphira greeted them with a soft bugle as eragon dismounted
murtagh helped him remove the elf from saphira is saddle and lower her to the ground
then they sagged against the rock face exhausted
