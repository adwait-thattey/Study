they cleared the table and took the dishes outside where they cleaned them with sand
oromis crumbled what remained of the bread around his house for the birds to eat then they returned inside
oromis brought out pens and ink for eragon and they resumed his education of the liduen kvaedhi the written form of the ancient language which was so much more elegant than the humans or dwarves runes
eragon lost himself in the arcane glyphs happy to have a task that required nothing more strenuous than rote memorization
after hours spent bent over the paper sheets oromis waved a hand and said enough
we will continue this ** eragon leaned back and rolled his shoulders while oromis selected five scrolls from their nooks in the wall
two of these are in the ancient language three are in your native tongue
they will help you to master both alphabets as well as give you valuable information that would be tedious for me to vocalize
with unerring accuracy oromis is hand darted out and plucked a massive sixth scroll from the wall which he added to the pyramid in eragon is arms
this is a dictionary
i doubt you can but try to read it all
when the elf opened the door for him to leave eragon said master
when will we start working with magic
oromis leaned on one arm against the doorway caving in on himself as if he no longer possessed the will to remain upright
then he sighed and said you must trust me to guide your training eragon
still i suppose it would be foolish of me to delay any longer
come leave the scrolls on the table and let us go explore the mysteries of gramarye
on the greensward before the hut oromis stood looking out over the crags of tel naeir his back to eragon his feet shoulder width apart and his hands clasped in the small of his back
without turning around he asked what is magic
the manipulation of energy through the use of the ancient language
there was a pause before oromis responded
technically you are correct and many spellcasters never understand more than that
however your description fails to capture the essence of magic
magic is the art ofthinking not strength or language you already know that a limited vocabulary is no obstacle to using magic
as with everything else you must master magic relies on having a disciplined intellect
brom bypassed the normal training regimen and ignored the subtleties of gramarye to ensure that you had the skills you needed to remain alive
i too must distort the regimen in order to focus on the skills that you will likely require in the coming battles
however whereas brom taught you the crude mechanics of magic i will teach you its finer applications the secrets that were reserved for the wisest of the riders how you can kill with no more energy than moving your finger the method by which you can instantaneously transport an item from one point to another a spell that will allow you to identify poisons in your food and drink a variation on scrying that allows you to hear as well as to see how you can draw energy from your surroundings and thus preserve your own strength and how you can maximize your strength in every possible way
these techniques are so potent and dangerous they were never shared with novice riders such as yourself but circumstances demand that i divulge them and trust that you wo not abuse ** raising his right arm to his side his hand a hooked claw oromis proclaimed **
eragon watched as a sphere of water coalesced from the brook by the hut and floated through the air until it hovered between oromis is outstretched fingers
the brook was dark and brown under the branches of the forest but the sphere removed from it was as colorless as glass
flecks of moss dirt and other bits of detritus floated inside the orb
still gazing toward the horizon oromis said ** he tossed the sphere back over his shoulder toward eragon
eragon tried to grab the ball but as soon as it touched his skin the water lost cohesion and splashed across his chest
catch it with magic said oromis
again he cried ** and a sphere of water gathered itself from the surface of the brook and leaped into his hand like a trained hawk obeying its master
