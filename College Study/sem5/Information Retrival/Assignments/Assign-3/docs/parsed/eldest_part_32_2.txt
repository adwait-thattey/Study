gertrude clucked her tongue as she inspected him then refastened the bandages and looked roran in the eye
you re doing well enough but the tissue may become diseased
i can not tell yet
if it does we will have to cauterize your shoulder
roran nodded
will my arm work once it heals
as long as the muscle knits together properly
it also depends on how you want to use it
you
will i be able to fight
if you want to fight said gertrude slowly i suggest that you learn to use your left ** she patted his cheek then hurried back toward her hut
my ** stared at his bound limb as if it no longer belonged to him
until that moment he had not realized how closely his sense of identity was linked to the condition of his body
injuring his flesh caused injury to his psyche as well as the other way around
roran was proud of his body and seeing it mutilated sent a jolt of panic through him especially since the damage was permanent
even if he regained the use of his arm he would always bear a thick scar as a memento of his injury
taking his hand elain led roran back into the house where she crumbled mint into a kettle then set it on the stove to boil
you really love her do not you
what he looked at her startled
elain rested a hand on her belly
** she smiled
i am not blind
i know what you ve done for her and i am proud of you
not every man would go as far
it wo not matter if i can not free her
the kettle began to whistle stridently
you will i am sure of it one way or ** elain poured the tea
we had better start preparing for the trip
i am going to sort through the kitchen first
while i do can you go upstairs and bring me all the clothes bedding and anything else you think might be useful
where should i put it asked roran
the dining room will be fine
since the mountains were too steep and the forest too dense for wagons roran realized that their supplies were limited to however much they could carry themselves as well as what they could pile onto horst is two horses although one of those had to be left partially unburdened so that elain could ride whenever the trail proved too strenuous for her pregnancy
compounding the issue was the fact that some families in carvahall did not have enough steeds for both provisions and the young old and infirm who would be unable to keep pace on foot
everyone would have to share resources
the question though was with whom they still did not know who else was going besides birgit and delwin
thus when elain finished packing the items she deemed essential mainly food and shelter she sent roran to find out if anyone needed extra storage space and if not if she could borrow some in turn for there were plenty of nonessential items she wanted to bring but would otherwise abandon
despite the people hurrying through the streets carvahall was heavy with a forced stillness an unnatural calm that belied the feverish activity hidden within the houses
almost everyone was silent and walked with downturned faces engrossed in their own thoughts
when roran arrived at orval is house he had to pound on the knocker for almost a minute before the farmer answered the door
oh it is you ** orval stepped out on the porch
sorry for the wait but i was busy
how can i help you he tapped a long black pipe against his palm then began to roll it nervously between his fingers
inside the house roran heard chairs being shoved across the floor and pots and pans banging together
roran quickly explained elain is offer and request
orval squinted up at the sky
i reckon i ve got enough room for my own stuff
ask around an if you still need space i have a pair of oxen that could hold a bit more
orval shifted uncomfortably
well i would not say that
we re just
getting ready in case of another attack
** puzzled roran trudged on to kiselt is house
he soon discovered that no one was willing to reveal whether they had decided to leave even when evidence of their preparations was in plain sight
and they all treated roran with a deference that he found unsettling
it manifested itself in small gestures offers of condolences for his misfortune respectful silence whenever he spoke and murmurs of assent when he made a statement
