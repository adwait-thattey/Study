others went to speak with orik as eragon withdrew a seemingly endless train of dwarves eager to demonstrate their loyalty to their new king
the procession continued for hours and then the gift giving began
each of the dwarves brought orik an offering from their clan or their guild a goblet of gold filled to the brim with rubies and diamonds a corselet of enchanted mail that no blade could pierce a tapestry twenty feet long woven of the soft wool the dwarves combed from the beards of the feldunost goats a tablet of agate inscribed with the names of every one of orik is ancestors a curved dagger ground from the tooth of a dragon and many other treasures
in exchange orik presented the dwarves with rings as tokens of his gratitude
eragon and saphira were the last to go before orik
once again kneeling at the base of the dais eragon drew from his tunic the gold armband he had begged from the dwarves the previous night
he held it up toward orik saying here is my gift king orik
i did not make the armlet but i have set on it spells to protect you
so long as you wear it you need fear no poison
if an assassin tries to hit or stab you or throw any kind of object at you the weapon will miss
the band will even shield you from most hostile magic
and it has other properties as well which you may find of use if your life is in danger
inclining his head orik accepted the band from eragon and said your gift is most appreciated eragon ** in full view of everyone orik slid the band onto his left arm
saphira spoke next projecting her thoughts to everyone who was watching my gift is this orik
she walked past the throne her claws clacking against the floor and reared up and placed her forefeet upon the edge of the scaffolding around the star sapphire
the stout wood beams creaked under her weight but held
minutes passed and nothing happened but saphira remained where she was gazing at the huge gemstone
the dwarves watched her never blinking hardly breathing
are you sure you can do this eragon asked reluctant to break her concentration
i do not know
the few times i used magic before i did not pause to consider whether i was casting a spell or not
i just willed the world to change and it did
it was not a deliberate process
i suppose i will have to wait until the moment feels right for me to mend isidar mithrim
let me help
let me work a spell through you
no little one
this is my task not yours
a single voice low and clear wafted across the chamber singing a slow wistful melody
one by one the other members of the hidden dwarf choir joined in the song filling tronjheim with the plaintive beauty of their music
eragon was going to ask for them to be silent but saphira said it is all right
leave them alone
although he did not understand what the choir sang eragon could tell from the tone of the music that it was a lamentation for things that had been and were no more such as the star sapphire
as the song built toward its conclusion he found himself thinking of his lost life in palancar valley and tears welled in his eyes
to his surprise he sensed a similar strain of pensive melancholy from saphira
neither sorrow nor regret was a normal part of her personality so he wondered at it and would have questioned her except that he also sensed a stirring of something deep within her like the awakening of some ancient part of her being
the song ended on a long wavering note and as it faded into oblivion a surge of energy rushed through saphira so much energy eragon gasped at its magnitude and she bent and touched the star sapphire with the tip of her snout
the branching cracks within the giant gemstone flared bright as bolts of lightning and then the scaffolding shattered and fell to the floor revealing isidar mithrim whole and sound again
but not quite the same
the color of the jewel was a deeper richer shade of red than before and the innermost petals of the rose were shot through with streaks of dusky gold
the dwarves stared in wonder at isidar mithrim
then they leaped to their feet cheering and applauding saphira with such enthusiasm it sounded like the pounding roar of a waterfall
