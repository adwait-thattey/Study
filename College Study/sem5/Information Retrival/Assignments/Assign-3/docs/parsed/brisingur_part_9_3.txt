her halting speech and uncertain tones exposed her unfamiliarity with her birth tongue emphasizing that she had not grown up in their tribe but was an outsider
the ploy undermined her authority
i always welcome new allies she said
however i cannot indulge in favoritism nor should you have need of it
your tribes are strong and well gifted
they should be able to rise quickly through the ranks of the varden without having to rely upon the charity of others
are you starving dogs to sit whining at my table or are you men who can feed themselves if you can then i look forward to working with you to better the varden is lot and to defeat galbatorix
** exclaimed fadawar
your offer is as false as you are
we shall not do servants work we are the chosen ones
you insult us you do
you stand there and you smile but your heart is full of scorpion is poison
stifling her anger nasuada attempted to calm the warlord
it was not my intent to cause offense
i was only trying to explain my position
i have no enmity for the wandering tribes nor have i any special love for them
is that such a bad thing
it is worse than bad it is bald faced ** your father made certain requests of us based upon our relation and now you ignore our service and turn us away like empty handed **
a sense of resignation overwhelmed nasuada
so elva was right it is inevitable she thought
a thrill of fear and excitement coursed through her
if it must be then i have no reason to maintain this charade
allowing her voice to ring forth she said requests that you did not honor half the time
you did not
and even if you were telling the truth the varden is position is too precarious for me to give you something for nothing
you ask for favors yet tell me what do you offer in return will you help fund the varden with your gold and jewels
will you give me the use of your craftsmen free of charge
how then do you intend to earn these boons you cannot pay with warriors your men already fight for me whether in the varden or in king orrin is army
be content with what you have warlord and do not seek more than is rightfully yours
you twist the truth to suit your own selfish goals
i seek what is rightfully ** that is why i am here
you talk and you talk yet your words are meaningless for by your actions you have betrayed ** the bangles on his arms clattered together as he gestured as if before an audience of thousands
you admit we are your people
then do you still follow our customs and worship our gods
here is the turning point thought nasuada
she could lie and claim she had abandoned the old ways but if she did the varden would lose fadawar is tribes and other nomads besides once they heard of her statement
we need them
we need everyone we can get if we re to have the slightest chance of toppling galbatorix
then i say you are unfit to lead the varden and as is my right i challenge you to the trial of the long knives
if you are triumphant we shall bow to you and never again question your authority
but if you lose then you shall step aside and i shall take your place as head of the varden
nasuada noted the spark of glee that lit fadawar is eyes
this is what he wanted all along she realized
he would have invoked the trial even if i had complied with his demands
she said perhaps i am mistaken but i thought it was tradition that whoever won assumed command of his rival is tribes as well as his own
is that not so she almost laughed at the expression of dismay that flashed across fadawar is face
you did not expect me to know that did you
i accept your challenge then with the understanding that should i win your crown and scepter will be mine
are we agreed
fadawar scowled and nodded
we ** he stabbed his scepter deep enough into the ground that it stood upright by itself then grasped the first bangle on his left arm and began to work it down over his hand
wait said nasuada
going to the table that filled the other side of the pavilion she picked up a small brass bell and rang it twice paused and then rang it four times
only a moment or two passed before farica entered the tent
