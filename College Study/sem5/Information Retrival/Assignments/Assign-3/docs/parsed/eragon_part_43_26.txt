the monsters howled in pain arms flailing
a torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch and an orange pillar of greasy flames roared up in the opening engulfing the urgals in an inferno
sickened eragon looked across farthen dur at the other two battalions and saw similar fires by each
he sheathed zar roc and strung his bow
more urgals soon tamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned brethren
they clumped together presenting a solid wall to the men and dwarves
behind the palisade orik had helped build the first row of archers pulled on their bows and fired
eragon and arya added their arrows to the deadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the urgals ranks
the urgal line wavered threatening to break but they covered themselves with their shields and weathered the attack
again the archers fired but the urgals continued to stream onto the surface at a ferocious rate
eragon was dismayed by their numbers
they were supposed to kill every single one it seemed a madman is task
his only encouragement was that he saw none of galbatorix is troops with the urgals
not yet at least
the opposing army formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly
tattered and sullen standards were raised in the monsters midst
baleful notes echoed through farthen dur as war horns sounded
the entire group of urgals charged with savage war cries
they dashed against the rows of stakes covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as the ranks at the vanguard were crushed against the posts
a cloud of black arrows flew over the barrier at the crouched defenders
eragon ducked behind his shield and saphira covered her head
arrows rattled harmlessly against her armor
momentarily foiled by the pickets the urgal horde milled with confusion
the varden bunched together waiting for the next attack
after a pause the war cries were raised again as the urgals surged forward
the assault was bitter
its momentum carried the urgals through the stakes where a line of pikemen jabbed frantically at their ranks trying to repel them
the pikemen held briefly but the ominous tide of urgals could not be halted and they were overwhelmed
the first lines of defense breached the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first time
a deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the conflict
saphira bellowed and leapt toward the fight diving into a whirlwind of noise and blurred action
with her jaws and talons saphira tore through an urgal
her teeth were as lethal as any sword her tail a giant mace
from her back eragon parried a hammer blow from an urgal chief protecting her vulnerable wings
zar roc is crimson blade seemed to gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length
from the corner of his eye eragon saw orik hewing urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax
beside the dwarf was murtagh on tornac his face disfigured by a vicious snarl as he swung his sword angrily cutting through every defense
then saphira spun around and eragon saw arya leap past the lifeless body of an opponent
an urgal bowled over a wounded dwarf and hacked at saphira is front right leg
his sword skated off her armor with a burst of sparks
eragon smote him on the head but zar roc stuck in the monster is horns and was yanked from his grasp
with a curse he dived off saphira and tackled the urgal smashing his face with the shield
he jerked zar roc out of the horns then dodged as another urgal charged him
saphira i need ** shouted but the battle is tide had separated them
suddenly a kull jumped at him club raised for a blow
unable to lift his shield in time eragon uttered ** the kull is head snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke
four more urgals succumbed to zar roc is thirsty bite then murtagh rode up beside eragon driving the press of urgals backward
come ** he shouted and reached down from tornac pulling eragon onto the horse
they rushed toward saphira who was embroiled in a mass of enemies
twelve spear wielding urgals encircled her needling her with their lances
they had already managed to prick both of her wings
