since it will happen with or without our approval we should agree to help
she snorted ** am worried about galbatorix
until now we have not made it public where our sympathies lie
our actions have been clear enough
yes but even when durza fought you in tronjheim he was not trying to kill you
if we become outspoken in our opposition to the empire galbatorix wo not be so lenient again
who knows what forces or plots he may have kept in abeyance while he tried to gain hold of us as long as we remain ambiguous he wo not know what to do
the time for ambiguity has passed asserted ** fought the urgals killed durza and i have sworn fealty to the leader of the varden
no ambiguity exists
no with your permission i will agree to her proposal
she was silent for a long while then dipped her ** you wish
he put a hand on her side before returning his attention to nasuada and saying do what you see fit
if this is how we can best assist the varden so be it
thank you
i know it is a lot to ask
now as we discussed before the funeral i expect you to travel to ellesmera and complete your training
of course
the elves have refused contact with both humans and dwarves ever since she was captured
arya is the only being who can convince them to emerge from seclusion
could not she use magic to tell them of her rescue
unfortunately not
when the elves retreated into du weldenvarden after the fall of the riders they placed wards around the forest that prevent any thought item or being from entering it through arcane means though not from exiting it if i understood arya is explanation
thus arya must physically visit du weldenvarden before queen islanzadi will know that she is alive that you and saphira exist and of the numerous events that have befallen the varden these past ** nasuada handed him the scroll
it was stamped with a wax sigil
this is a missive for queen islanzadi telling her about the varden is situation and my own plans
guard it with your life it would cause a great deal of harm in the wrong hands
i hope that after all that is happened islanzadi will feel kindly enough toward us to reinitiate diplomatic ties
her assistance could mean the difference between victory and defeat
arya knows this and has agreed to press our case but i wanted you aware of the situation too so you could take advantage of any opportunities that might arise
eragon tucked the scroll into his jerkin
when will we leave
tomorrow morning
unless you have something already planned
** she clasped her hands
you should know one other person will be traveling with ** he looked at her quizzically
king hrothgar insisted that in the interest of fairness there should be a dwarf representative present at your training since it affects their race as well
so he is sending orik along
eragon is first reaction was irritation
saphira could have flown arya and him to du weldenvarden thereby eliminating weeks of unnecessary travel
three passengers however were too many to fit on saphira is shoulders
orik is presence would confine them to the ground
upon further reflection eragon acknowledged the wisdom of hrothgar is request
it was important for eragon and saphira to maintain a semblance of equality in their dealings with the different races
he smiled
ah well it will slow us down but i suppose we have to placate hrothgar
to tell the truth i am glad orik is coming
crossing alagaesia with only arya was a rather daunting prospect
she is
** he grew serious again
do you really mean to attack the empire you said yourself that the varden are weak
it does not seem like the wisest course
if we wait
if we wait she said sternly galbatorix will only get stronger
this is the first time since morzan was slain that we have even the slightest opportunity of catching him unprepared
he had no reason to suspect we could defeat the urgals which we did thanks to you so he wo not have readied the empire for invasion
** ** how does she plan to kill galbatorix when he flies out to obliterate their army with magic
nasuada shook her head in response when eragon restated the objection
