ablast of ravening wind tore eragon from his sleep
blankets flapped over him as a tempest clawed at his room hurling his possessions into the air and knocking the lanterns against the walls
outside the sky was black with thunderheads
saphira watched as eragon staggered upright and fought to keep his balance as the tree swayed like a ship at sea
he lowered his head against the gale and made his way around the room clutching at the wall until he reached the teardrop portal through which the storm howled
eragon looked past the heaving floor to the ground below
it appeared to rock back and forth
he swallowed and tried to ignore the churning in his stomach
by touch he found the edge of the cloth membrane that could be pulled out of the wood to cover the opening
he prepared to launch himself from one side of the gap to the next
if he slipped nothing would stop him from falling onto the roots of the tree
she backed off the low pedestal where she slept and laid her tail alongside him so that he could use it as a handrail
holding the cloth with just his right hand which took all his strength eragon used the line of spikes on saphira is tail to pull himself across the portal
as soon as he reached the far side he grabbed the cloth with both hands and pressed its edge into the groove that locked it in place
the membrane bulged inward under the force of the angry elements but showed no sign of giving
eragon poked it with his finger
the fabric was as taut as a drum
it is amazing what the elves can do he said
saphira cocked her head then lifted it so that her head was flat against the ceiling while she ** d better close up the study it is being wrecked
as he headed toward the stairs the tree jolted and his leg buckled sending him down hard on one knee
the study was a whirlwind of paper and quills darting about as if they had a mind of their own
he dove into the flurry with his arms wrapped around his head
it felt like he was being pelted with stones when the tips of the quills struck him
eragon struggled to close the upper portal without saphira is help
the moment he did pain endless mind numbingpain ripped open his back
he screamed once and went hoarse from the strength of his cry
his vision flashed with red and yellow then faded to black as he toppled to his side
below he heard saphira howl with frustration the staircase was too small and outside the wind was too ferocious for her to reach him
his connection with her receded
he surrendered to the waiting darkness as a release from his agony
a sour taste filled eragon is mouth when he woke
he did not know how long he had been lying on the floor but the muscles in his arms and legs were knotted from being curled into a tight ball
the storm still assailed the tree accompanied by a thudding rain that matched the pounding in his head
i am here
can you come down
he was too weak to stand on the pitching floor so he crawled to the stairs and slid down one at a time wincing with each impact
halfway down he encountered saphira who had jammed her head and neck as far up the stairs as she could gouging the wood in her frenzy
little ** flicked out her tongue and caught him on the hand with its rough tip
he smiled
then she arched her neck and tried to pull back but to no avail
you re
he could not help it he laughed even though it hurt
the situation was too absurd
she snarled and heaved her entire body shaking the tree with her efforts and knocking him over
then she collapsed ** do not just sit there grinning like an idiot fox
help me
fighting the urge to giggle he put his foot on her nose and pushed as hard as he dared while saphira twisted and squirmed in an attempt to free herself
it took more than ten minutes before she succeeded
only then did eragon see the full extent of the damage to the stairwell
he groaned
her scales had cut through the bark and obliterated the delicate patterns grown out from the wood
at leastyoudid it not me ** elves might forgive ** d sing dwarf love ballads night and day if you asked them to
he joined saphira on her dais and huddled against the flat scales of her belly listening as the storm roared about them
