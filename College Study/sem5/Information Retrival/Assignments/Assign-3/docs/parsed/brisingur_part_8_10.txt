you have pus for marrow and fungus for brains and you re a scug backed cheek **
there was eragon thought something rather obscenely impressive about sloan is swearing although his admiration did not prevent him from wanting to strangle the butcher or to at least respond in kind
what stayed his desire for retaliation however was his suspicion that sloan was deliberately trying to infuriate him enough to strike down the older man and thus give him a quick and undeserved end
eragon said bastard i may be but not a ** sloan drew a sharp breath
before he could resume his torrent of abuse eragon added wherever you go you shall not want for food nor will wild animals attack you
i will place certain enchantments around you that will keep men and beasts from troubling you and will cause animals to bring you sustenance when you need it
you can not do this whispered sloan
even in the starlight eragon could see the last remnants of color drain from his skin leaving him bone white
you do not have the means
you do not have the right
i am a dragon rider
i have as much right as any king or queen
then eragon who had no interest in continuing to chastise sloan uttered the butcher is true name loud enough for him to hear
an expression of horror and revelation crawled across sloan is face and he threw his arms up before him and howled as if he had been stabbed
his cry was raw and jagged and desolate the scream of a man condemned by his own nature to a fate he could not escape
he fell forward onto the palms of his hands and remained in that position and began to sob his face obscured by shocks of hair
eragon watched transfixed by sloan is reaction
does learning your true name affect everyone like this would this happen to me as well
hardening his heart to sloan is misery eragon set about doing what he said he would
he repeated sloan is true name and word by word schooled the butcher in the ancient language oaths that would ensure sloan never met or contacted katrina again
sloan resisted with much weeping and wailing and grinding of his teeth but no matter how vigorously he struggled he had no choice but to obey whenever eragon invoked his true name
and when they finished with the oaths eragon cast the five spells that would drive sloan toward ellesmera would protect him from unprovoked violence and would entice the birds and the beasts and the fish that dwelled in the rivers and lakes to feed him
eragon fashioned the spells so they would derive their energy from sloan and not himself
midnight was a fading memory by the time eragon completed the final incantation
drunk with weariness he leaned against the hawthorn staff
sloan lay curled at his feet
a garbled moan drifted up from the figure below
it sounded as if sloan were attempting to say something
frowning eragon knelt beside him
sloan is cheeks were red and bloody where he had scraped them with his fingers
his nose ran and tears dripped from the corner of his left eye socket which was the less mutilated of the two
pity and guilt welled up inside of eragon it gave him no pleasure to see sloan reduced to such a low state
he was a broken man stripped of everything he valued in life including his self delusions and eragon was the one who had broken him
the accomplishment left eragon feeling soiled as if he had done something shameful
it was necessary he thought but no one should have to do what i did
another moan emanated from sloan and then he said
only a piece of rope
i did not mean to
ismira
no no please no
the butcher is ramblings subsided and in the intervening silence eragon placed his hand on sloan is upper arm
sloan stiffened at the contact
eragon
he whispered
eragon
i am blind and you send me to walk the land
to walk the land alone
i am forsaken and forsworn
i know who i am and i cannot bear it
help me kill ** free me of this agony
on an impulse eragon pressed the hawthorn rod into sloan is right hand and said take my staff
let it guide you on your journey
a cracked shout burst from sloan is throat and he thrashed from side to side and pounded the earth with his fists
