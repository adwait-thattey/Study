the beast paused then proceeded at a slower pace sniffing at the ground here and there
as it entered the circle of firelight eragon is breath caught in his throat
standing before them was a graybacked wolf as big as a horse with fangs like sabers and burning yellow eyes that followed their every movement
the wolf is feet were the size of bucklers
as the giant wolf circled their camp moving almost silently despite his great bulk eragon thought of the elves and how they would deal with a wild animal and in the ancient language he said brother wolf we mean you no harm
tonight our pack rests and does not hunt
you are welcome to share our food and the warmth of our den until ** the shrrg paused and his ears swiveled forward while eragon spoke in the ancient language
firesword what are you doing growled garzhvog
the heavy shouldered beast slowly entered their camp the tip of his huge wet nose twitching the whole while
the wolf poked his shaggy head toward the fire seemingly curious about the writhing flames then moved over to the scraps of meat and viscera scattered over the ground where garzhvog had butchered the buck
crouching the wolf snapped up the gobbets of flesh then rose and without a backward glance padded off into the depths of the night
eragon relaxed and sheathed the falchion
garzhvog however remained standing where he was his lips pulled back in a snarl looking and listening for anything out of the ordinary in the surrounding darkness
as they passed underneath the boughs of the dense forest that guarded the interior of the mountain range the air became noticeably cooler and the soft bed of needles on the ground muffled their footsteps
the tall dark grim trees that loomed over them seemed to be watching as they made their way between the thick trunks and around the twisted roots that knuckled up out of the moist earth standing two three and often four feet high
large black squirrels scampered among the branches chattering loudly
a thick layer of moss blanketed the corpses of trees that had fallen
ferns and thimbleberries and other green leafy plants flourished alongside mushrooms of every shape size and color
the world narrowed once eragon and garzhvog were fully inside the long valley
the gigantic mountains pressed close on either side oppressive with their bulk and the sky was a distant unreachabl
strip of sea blue the highest sky eragon had ever seen
a few thin clouds grazed the shoulders of the mountains
an hour or so after noon eragon and garzhvog slowed as a series of terrible roars echoed among the trees
eragon pulled his sword from its sheath and garzhvog plucked a smooth river rock from the ground and fit it in the pocket of his sling
it is a cave bear said garzhvog
a furious high pitched squeal similar to metal scraping over metal punctuated his statement
and nagra
we must be careful firesword
they proceeded at a slow pace and soon spotted the animals several hundred feet up the side of a mountain
a drove of reddish boars with thick slashing tusks milled in squealing confusion before a huge mass of silver brown fur hooked claws and snapping teeth that moved with deadly speed
at first the distance fooled eragon but then he compared the animals to the trees next to them and realized that each boar would have dwarfed a shrrg and that the bear was nearly as large as his house in palancar valley
the boars had bloodied the cave bear is flanks but that seemed to only enrage the beast
rearing on his hind legs the bear bellowed and swatted one of the boars with a massive paw knocking it aside and tearing open its hide
three more times the boar attempted to rise and three more times the cave bear struck at it until at last the boar gave up and lay still
as the bear bent to feed the rest of the squealing pigs fled back under the trees heading higher up the mountain and away from the bear
awed by the bear is strength eragon followed garzhvog as the urgal slowly walked across the bear is field of vision
lifting his crimson snout from the belly of his kill the bear watched them with small beady eyes then apparently decided they were no threat to him and resumed eating
