layer upon layer of pregnant clouds blanketed palancar valley clinging to the mountains with tenacious arms and filling the air with heavy cold mist
from inside roran watched as cords of gray water pelted the trees with their frothing leaves muddied the trench around carvahall and scrabbled with blunt fingers against the thatched roofs and eaves as the clouds disgorged their load
everything was streaked blurred and hidden behind the torrent is inexorable streamers
by midmorning the storm had abated although a continuous drizzle still percolated through the mist
it quickly soaked roran is hair and clothes when he took his watch at the barricade to the main road
he squatted by the upright logs shook his cloak then pulled the hood farther over his face and tried to ignore the cold
despite the weather roran soared and exulted with his joy at katrina is acceptance
they were ** in his mind it was as if a missing piece of the world had dropped into place as if he had been granted the confidence of an invulnerable warrior
what did the soldiers matter or the ra zac or the empire itself before love such as theirs they were nothing but tinder to the blaze
for all his new bliss however his mind was entirely focused on what had become the most important conundrum of his existence how to assure that katrina would survive galbatorix is wrath
he had thought of nothing else since ** best thing would be for katrina to go to cawley is he decided staring down the hazy road but she would never agree to leave
unless sloan told her to
i might be able to convince him i am sure he wants her out of danger as much as i do
as he considered ways to approach the butcher the clouds thickened again and the rain renewed its assault on the village arching down in stinging waves
around roran the puddles jumped to life as pellets of water drummed their surfaces bouncing back up like startled grasshoppers
when roran grew hungry he passed his watch to larne loring is youngest son and went to find lunch darting from the shelter of one eave to another
as he rounded a corner he was surprised to see albriech on the house is porch arguing violently with a group of men
ridley shouted
you re blind follow the cottonwoods and they will never ** you took the addle brain is route
try it if you want retorted albriech
then you can tell me how you like the taste of arrows
maybe said thane we are not as clubfooted as you are
albriech turned on him with a snarl
your words are as thick as your wits
i am not stupid enough to risk my family on the cover of a few leaves that i ve never seen ** thane is eyes bulged and his face turned a deep mottled crimson
what taunted albriech
have you no tongue
thane roared and struck albriech on the cheek with his fist
albriech laughed
your arm is as weak as a woman ** then he grabbed thane is shoulder and threw him off the porch and into the mud where he lay on his side stunned
holding his spear like a staff roran jumped beside albriech preventing ridley and the others from laying hands on him
no more growled roran furious
we have other enemies
an assembly can be called and arbitrators will decide whether compensation is due to either albriech or thane
but until then wecan not fight ourselves
easy for you to say spat ridley
you have no wife or ** then he helped thane to his feet and departed with the group of men
roran stared hard at albriech and the purple bruise that was spreading beneath his right eye
what started it he asked
i albriech stopped with a grimace and felt his jaw
i went scouting with darmmen
the ra zac have posted soldiers on several hills
they can see across the anora and up and down the valley
one or two of us might might be able to creep past them without notice but we will never get the children to cawley without killing the soldiers and then we might as well tell the ra zac where we re going
dread clutched at roran flooding like poison through his heart and ** can i do sick with a sense of impending doom he put an arm around albriech is shoulders
come on gertrude should have a look at you
