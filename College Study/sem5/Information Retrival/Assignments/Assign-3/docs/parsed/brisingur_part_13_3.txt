her sympathies could shift and you would do well to ponder your fate if she turned against you
the nighthawks however will never betray you
we are yours lady nasuada fully and completely
so please let the nighthawks do what they are supposed to do
let us protect you
initially nasuada was indifferent to his arguments but his eloquence and the clarity of his reasoning impressed her
he was she thought a man she might have use for elsewhere
i see jormundur has surrounded me with warriors as skilled with their tongues as they are with their swords she said with a smile
you are right
i should not have left you and your men behind and i am sorry
it was careless and inconsiderate
i am still unaccustomed to having guards with me at all hours of the day and sometimes i forget i cannot move about with the freedom i once did
you have my word of honor captain garven it shall not happen again
i do not wish to cripple the nighthawks any more than you
nasuada turned back toward the elves but they were hidden from sight below the bank of a dry stream a quarter of a mile away
it strikes me garven that you may have invented a motto for the nighthawks a moment ago
did i if so i cannot recall
you did
the smartest the toughest and the meanest you said
that would be a fine motto although perhaps without the and
if the other nighthawks approve of it you should have trianna translate the phrase into the ancient language and i will have it inscribed on your shields and embroidered on your standards
you are most generous my lady
when we return to our tents i shall discuss the matter with jormundur and my fellow captains
only
he hesitated then and guessing at what troubled him nasuada said but you are worried that such a motto may be too vulgar for men of your position and you would prefer something more noble and high minded am i right
exactly my lady he said with a relieved expression
it is a valid concern i suppose
the nighthawks represent the varden and you must interact with notables of every race and rank in the course of your duty
it would be regrettable if you were to convey the wrong impression
very well i leave it to you and your compatriots to devise an appropriate motto
i am confident you will do an excellent job
at that moment the twelve elves emerged from the dry streambed and garven after murmuring additional thanks moved a discreet distance from nasuada
composing herself for a state visit nasuada signaled angela and elva to return
when he was still several hundred feet away the lead elf appeared soot black from head to toe
at first nasuada assumed he was dark skinned like herself and wearing dark attire but as he drew closer she saw that the elf wore only a loincloth and a braided fabric belt with a small pouch attached
the rest of him was covered with midnight blue fur that glistened with a healthy sheen under the glare of the sun
on average the fur was a quarter inch long a smooth flexible armor that mirrored the shape and movement of the underlying muscles but on his ankles and the undersides of his forearms it extended a full two inches and between his shoulder blades there was a ruffled mane that stuck out a handsbreadth from his body and tapered down along his back to the base of his spine
jagged bangs shadowed his brow and catlike tufts sprouted from the tips of his pointed ears but otherwise the fur on his face was so short and flat only its color betrayed its presence
his eyes were bright yellow
instead of fingernails a claw protruded from each of his middle fingers
and as he slowed to a stop before her nasuada noticed that a certain odor surrounded him a salty musk reminiscent of dry juniper wood oiled leather and smoke
it was such a strong smell and so obviously masculine nasuada felt her skin go hot and cold and crawl with anticipation and she blushed and was glad it would not show
the rest of the elves were more as she had expected of the same general build and complexion as arya with short tunics of dusky orange and pine needle green
six were men and six were women
they all had raven hair save for two of the women whose hair was like starlight
