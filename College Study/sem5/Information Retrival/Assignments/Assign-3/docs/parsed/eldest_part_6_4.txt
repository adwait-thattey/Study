now i see you siding with the council of elders willingly or not to control ** you have overturned a lifetime of ** have you done
dismayed eragon dropped all pretenses
with short clear words he explained why he had agreed to the council is demands and how he and saphira had attempted to undermine them
when he finished arya stated so
** seventy years
though he knew elves lives were extraordinarily long he had never suspected that arya was that old and older for she appeared to be a woman in her early twenties
the only sign of age on her unlined face was her emerald eyes deep knowing and most often solemn
arya leaned back studying him
your position is not what i would wish but better than i had hoped
i was impolite saphira
and you
understand more than i thought
your compromise will be accepted by the elves though you must never forget your debt to us for saphira
there would be no riders without our efforts
the debt is burned into my blood and my palm said eragon
in the silence that followed he cast about for a new topic eager to prolong their conversation and perhaps learn more about her
you have been gone for such a long time do you miss ellesmera or did you live elsewhere
ellesmera was and always shall be my home she said looking beyond him
i have not lived in my family is house since i left for the varden when the walls and windows were draped with spring is first flowers
the times i ve returned were only fleeting stays vanishing flecks of memory by our measurement
he noticed once again that she smelled like crushed pine needles
it was a faint spicy odor that opened his senses and refreshed his mind
it must be hard to live among all these dwarves and humans without any of your kind
she cocked her head
you speak of humans as if you were not one
perhaps
he hesitated perhaps i am something else a mixture of two races
saphira lives inside me as much as i live in her
we share feelings senses thoughts even to the point where we are more one mind than ** saphira dipped her head in agreement nearly bumping the table with her snout
that is how it should be said arya
a pact more ancient and powerful than you can imagine links you
you wo not truly understand what it means to be a rider until your training is completed
but that must wait until after the funeral
in the meantime may the stars watch over you
with that she departed slipping into the library is shadowed depths
eragon ** it me or is everyone on edge today like arya one moment she is angry the next she is giving me a blessing
no one will be comfortable until things return to normal
