so many questions laughed brom bitterly
there is another chapter to all this one that took place long before you were born
back then i was a bit younger though perhaps not as wise
i hated the empire for reasons i will keep to myself and wanted to damage it in any way i could
my fervor led me to a scholar jeod who claimed to have discovered a book that showed a secret passageway into galbatorix is castle
i eagerly brought jeod to the varden who are my friends and they arranged to have the eggs stolen
however something went amiss and our thief got only one egg
for some reason he fled with it and did not return to the varden
when he was not found jeod and i were sent to bring him and the egg ** brom is eyes grew distant and he spoke in a curious voice
that was the start of one of the greatest searches in history
we raced against the ra zac and morzan last of the forsworn and the king is finest servant
** interrupted eragon
but he was the one who betrayed the riders to ** and that happened so long ** morzan must have been ancient
it disturbed him to be reminded of how long riders lived
so asked brom raising an eyebrow
yes he was old but strong and cruel
he was one of the king is first followers and by far his most loyal
as there had been blood between us before the hunt for the egg turned into a personal battle
when it was located in gil ead i rushed there and fought morzan for possession
it was a terrible contest but in the end i slew him
during the conflict i was separated from jeod
there was no time to search for him so i took the egg and bore it to the varden who asked me to train whomever became the new rider
i agreed and decided to hide in carvahall which i had been to several times before until the varden contacted me
i was never summoned
then how did saphira is egg appear in the spine was another one stolen from the king asked eragon
brom grunted
small chance of that
he has the remaining two guarded so thoroughly that it would be suicide to try and steal them
no saphira was taken from the varden and i think i know how
to protect the egg its guardian must have tried to send it to me with magic
the varden have not contacted me to explain how they lost the egg so i suspect that their runners were intercepted by the empire and the ra zac were sent in their place
i am sure they were quite eager to find me as i ve managed to foil many of their plans
then the ra zac did not know about me when they arrived in carvahall said eragon with wonder
that is right replied brom
if that ass sloan had kept his mouth shut they might not have found out about you
events could have turned out quite differently
in a way i have you to thank for my life
if the ra zac had not become so preoccupied with you they might have caught me unawares and that would have been the end of brom the storyteller
the only reason they ran was because i am stronger than the two of them especially during the day
they must have planned to drug me during the night then question me about the egg
you sent a message to the varden telling them about me
yes
i am sure they will want me to bring you to them as soon as possible
but you re not going to are you
brom shook his head
no i am not
why not being with the varden must be safer than chasing after the ra zac especially for a new rider
brom snorted and looked at eragon with fondness
the varden are dangerous people
if we go to them you will be entangled in their politics and machinations
their leaders may send you on missions just to make a point even though you might not be strong enough for them
i want you to be well prepared before you go anywhere near the varden
at least while we pursue the ra zac i do not have to worry about someone poisoning your water
this is the lesser of two evils
and he said with a smile it keeps you happy while i train you
tuatha du orothrim is just a stage in your instruction
iwill help you find and perhaps even kill the ra zac for they are as much my enemies as yours
but then you will have to make a choice
and that would be
asked eragon warily
whether to join the varden said brom
