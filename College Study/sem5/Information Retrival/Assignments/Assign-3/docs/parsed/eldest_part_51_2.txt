as mandel fell behind roran hunched one shoulder allowed a limp to creep into his walk and began to rehearse the story loring had concocted to explain their presence at teirm
he stepped off the road and ducked his head as a man drove a pair of lumbering oxen past grateful for the shadows that concealed his features
the gate loomed ahead washed in uncertain orange from the torches placed in sconces on each side of the entrance
underneath stood a pair of soldiers with galbatorix is twisting flame stitched onto the front of their crimson tunics
neither of the armed men so much as glanced at roran and his companions as they shuffled underneath the spiked portcullis and through the short tunnel beyond
roran squared his shoulders and felt some of his tension ease
he and the others clustered by the corner of a house where loring murmured so far so good
when mandel rejoined them they set out to find an inexpensive hostel where they could let a room
as they walked roran studied the layout of the city with its fortified houses which grew progressively higher toward the citadel and the gridlike arrangement of streets
those north to south radiated from the citadel like a starburst while those east to west curved gently across and formed a spiderweb pattern creating numerous places where barriers could be erected and soldiers stationed
if carvahall had been built like this he thought no one could have defeated us but the king himself
by dusk they had acquired lodging at the green chestnut an exceedingly vile tavern with atrocious ale and flea infested beds
its sole advantage was that it cost next to nothing
they went to sleep without dinner to save their precious coin and huddled together to prevent their purses from being filched by one of the tavern is other guests
the next day roran and his companions left the green chestnut before dawn to search for provisions and transportation
gertrude said i have heard tell of a remarkable herbalist angela by name who lives here and is supposed to work the most amazing cures perhaps even a touch of magic
i would go see her for if anyone has what i seek it would be she
you should not go alone said roran
he looked at mandel
accompany gertrude help her with her purchases and do your best to protect her if you are attacked
your nerve may be tested at times but do nothing to cause alarm unless you would betray your friends and family
mandel touched his forelock and nodded his obedience
he and gertrude departed at right angles down a cross street while roran and the rest resumed their hunt
roran had the patience of a stalking predator but even he began to thrum with restlessness when morning and afternoon slipped by and they still had not found a ship to carry them to surda
he learned that the three masted ship thedragon wing was newly built and about to be launched on her maiden voyage that they had no chance of hiring it from the blackmoor shipping company unless they could pay a roomful of the dwarves red gold and indeed that the villagers lacked the coin to engage even the meanest vessel
nor would taking clovis is barges solve their problems because it still left unanswered the question of what they would eat on their trek
it would be hard said birgit very hard to steal goods from this place what with all the soldiers and how close together the houses are and the watchmen at the gate
if we tried to cart that much stuff out of teirm they d want to know what we were doing
roran had suggested to horst that if the villagers were forced to flee teirm with naught but their remaining supplies they could raid for their food
however roran knew that such an act would mean they had become as monstrous as those he hated
he had no stomach for it
it was one thing to fight and kill those who served galbatorix or even to steal clovis is barges since clovis had other means of supporting himself but it was quite another to take provisions from innocent farmers who struggled to survive as much as the villagers had in palancar valley
that would be murder
