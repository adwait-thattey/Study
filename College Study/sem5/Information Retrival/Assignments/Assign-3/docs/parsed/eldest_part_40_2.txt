this time oromis threw the ball without warning
eragon was prepared though and said reisa du adurna even as he reached for the ball
it slowed to a halt a hairsbreadth from the skin of his palm
an awkward word choice said oromis but workable nevertheless
the ball reversed its course and sped toward the base of oromis is silver head
however the sphere did not land where eragon had intended but rather shot past the elf whipped around and flew back at eragon with increased velocity
the water remained as hard and solid as polished marble when it struck eragon producing a dullthunk as it collided with his skull
the blow knocked him sprawling on the turf where he lay stunned blinking as pulsing lights swam across the sky
yes said oromis
a better word might beletta orkodthr
he finally turned to look at eragon and raised an eyebrow with apparent surprise
whatever are you doing get up
we can not lay about all day
when eragon got back on his feet oromis had him manipulate the water in various ways shaping it into complex knots changing the color of light that it absorbed or reflected and freezing it in certain prescribed sequences none of which proved difficult for him
the exercises continued for so long that eragon is initial interest faded and was replaced by impatience and puzzlement
he was chary of offending oromis but he saw no point to what the elf was doing it was as if oromis were avoiding any spells that would require him to use more than a minimal amount of ** ve already demonstrated the extent of my skills
why does he persist in reviewing these fundamentals he said master i know all of this
can we not move on
the muscles in oromis is neck hardened and his shoulders were like chiseled granite for all they moved even the elf is breathing halted before he said will you never learn respect eragon vodhr so be ** then he uttered four words from the ancient language in a voice so deep that their meaning escaped eragon
eragon yelped as he felt each of his legs enveloped by pressure up to the knee squeezing and constricting his calves in such a way that made it impossible for him to walk
his thighs and upper body were free to move but other than that it was as if he had been cast in lime mortar
here now was a challenge that eragon had never dealt with before how to counter someone else is spells
he could sever his invisible bonds using one of two different methods
the most effective would be if he knewhow oromis had immobilized him whether by affecting his body directly or using an external source for then he could redirect the element or force to disperse oromis is power
or he could use a generic vague spell to block whatever oromis was doing
the downside to the tactic was that it would lead to a direct contest of strength between ** had to happen sometime thought eragon
he entertained no hope of prevailing against an elf
assembling the required phrase he said losna kalfya ** release my calves
the surge of energy that deserted eragon was greater than he had anticipated he went from being moderately tired from the day is pains and exertions to feeling as if he had hiked over rough terrain since morn
then the pressure vanished from his legs causing him to stagger as he regained his balance
oromis shook his head
foolish he said very foolish
if i had committed more to maintaining my spell that would have killed you
never use absolutes
never word your spells so that only two outcomes are possible success or death
if an enemy had trapped your legs and if he were stronger than you then you would have expended all of your energy trying to break his spell
you would have died with no chance to abort the attempt once you realized that it was futile
how do i avoid that asked eragon
it is safer to make the spell aprocess that you can terminate at your discretion
instead of sayingrelease my calves which is an absolute you could sayreduce the magic imprisoning my calves
a bit wordy but you could then decide how much you wanted your opponent is spell decreased and if it were safe to remove it entirely
