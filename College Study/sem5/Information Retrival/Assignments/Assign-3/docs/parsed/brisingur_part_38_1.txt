this is good farmland thought roran
he cast his mind back to palancar valley and again he saw the autumn sun streaming through the field of barley outside his family is house neat rows of golden stalks shifting in the breeze with the anora river to the west and the snowcapped mountains rising high on either side of the valley
that is where i should be plowing the earth and raising a family with katrina not watering the ground with the sap of men is limbs
ho ** cried captain edric pointing toward roran from on his horse
have an end to your dawdling stronghammer lest i change my mind about you and leave you to stand guard with the **
dusting his hands on his leggings roran rose from a kneeling position
yes ** as you wish ** he said suppressing his dislike for edric
since he had joined edric is company roran had attempted to learn what he could of the man is history
from what he heard roran had concluded edric was a competent commander nasuada never would have put him in charge of such an important mission otherwise but he had an abrasive personality and he disciplined his warriors for even the slightest deviation from established practice as roran had learned to his chagrin upon three separate occasions during his first day with edric is company
it was roran believed a style of command that undermined a man is morale as well as discouraged creativity and invention from those underneath you
perhaps nasuada gave me to him for those very reasons thought roran
or perhaps this is another test of hers
perhaps she wants to know whether i can swallow my pride long enough to work with a man like edric
getting back onto snowfire roran rode to the front of the column of two hundred and fifty men
their mission was simple since nasuada and king orrin had withdrawn the bulk of their forces from surda galbatorix had apparently decided to take advantage of their absence and wreak havoc throughout the defenseless country sacking towns and villages and burning the crops needed to sustain the invasion of the empire
the easiest way to eliminate the soldiers would have been for saphira to fly out and tear them to pieces but unless she was winging her way toward eragon everyone agreed it would be too dangerous for the varden to be without her for so long
so nasuada had sent edric is company to repel the soldiers whose number her spies had initially estimated to be around three hundred
however two days ago roran and the rest of the warriors had been dismayed when they came across tracks that indicated the size of galbatorix is force was closer to seven hundred
roran reined in snowfire next to carn on his dappled mare and scratched his chin while he studied the lay of the land
before them was a vast expanse of undulating grass dotted with occasional stands of willow and cottonwood trees
hawks hunted above while below the grass was full of squeaking mice rabbits burrowing rodents and other wildlife
the only evidence that men had ever visited the place before was the swath of trampled vegetation that led toward the eastern horizon marking the soldiers trail
carn glanced up at the noonday sun the skin pulling tight around his drooping eyes as he squinted
we should overtake them before our shadows are longer than we are tall
and then we will discover whether there are enough of us to drive them away muttered roran or whether they will just massacre us
for once i d like to outnumber our enemies
a grim smile appeared on carn is face
it is always thus with the varden
form ** shouted edric and spurred his horse down the trail trampled through the grass
roran clamped his jaw shut and touched his heels to snowfire is flanks as the company followed their captain
we re lucky they re on foot murmured carn indicating the red column of soldiers marching toward the village
we would not have been able to get here first otherwise
roran glanced back at the men gathered behind them
edric had given him temporary command over eighty one warriors
they consisted of swordsmen spearmen and a half dozen archers
one of edric is familiars sand led another eighty one of the company while edric headed the rest himself
