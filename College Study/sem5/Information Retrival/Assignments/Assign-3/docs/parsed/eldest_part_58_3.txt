then oromis surprised eragon by initiating the elves traditional greeting and thereby indicating his respect for eragon may good fortune rule over you
may the stars watch over you
and may peace live in your heart finished the silver haired elf
he repeated the exchange with saphira
now go and fly as fast as the north wind knowing that you saphira brightscales and eragon shadeslayer carry the blessing of oromis last scion of house thrandurin he who is both the mourning sage and the cripple who is whole
and mine as well added glaedr
extending his neck he touched the tip of his nose to saphira is his gold eyes glittering like swirling pools of ** to keep your heart safe saphira
she hummed in response
they parted with solemn farewells
saphira soared over the tangled forest and oromis and glaedr dwindled behind them lonely on the crags
despite the hardships of his stay in ellesmera eragon would miss being among the elves for with them he had found the closest thing to a home since fleeing palancar valley
i leave here a changed man he thought and closed his eyes clinging to saphira
before going to meet with orik they made one more stop tialdari hall
saphira landed in the enclosed gardens careful not to damage any of the plants with her tail or claws
without waiting for her to crouch eragon leaped straight to the ground a drop that would have injured him before
a male elf came out touched his lips with his first two fingers and asked if he could help them
when eragon replied that he sought an audience with islanzadi the elf said please wait here silver hand
not five minutes later the queen herself emerged from the wooded depths of tialdari hall her crimson tunic like a drop of blood among the white robed elf lords and ladies who accompanied her
after the appropriate forms of address were observed she said oromis informed me of your intention to leave us
i am displeased by this but one cannot resist the will of fate
no your majesty
your majesty we came to pay our respects before departing
you have been most considerate of us and we thank you and your house for clothing lodging and feeding us
we are in your debt
never in our debt rider
we but repaid a little of what we owe you and the dragons for our miserable failure in the fall
i am gratified though that you appreciate our ** she paused
when you arrive in surda convey my royal salutations to lady nasuada and king orrin and inform them that our warriors will soon attack the northern half of the empire
if fortune smiles upon us we shall catch galbatorix off guard and given time divide his forces
also know that i have dispatched twelve of our finest spellweavers to surda
if you are still alive when they arrive they will place themselves under your command and do their best to shield you from danger both night and day
islanzadi extended a hand and one of the elf lords handed her a shallow unadorned wooden box
oromis had his gifts for you and i have mine
let them remind you of your time spent with us under the dusky ** she opened the box revealing a long dark bow with reflexed limbs and curled tips nestled on a bed of velvet
silver fittings chased with dogwood leaves decorated the ears and grip of the bow
beside it lay a quiver of new arrows fletched with white swan feathers
now that you share our strength it seems only proper that you should have one of our bows
i sang it myself from a yew tree
the string will never break
and so long as you use these arrows you will be hard pressed to miss your target even if the wind should gust during your shot
once again eragon was overwhelmed by the elves generosity
he bowed
what can i say my lady you honor me that you saw fit to give me the labor of your own hands
islanzadi nodded as if agreeing with him then stepped past him and said saphira i brought you no gifts because i could think of nothing you might need or want but if there is aught of ours you desire name it and it shall be yours
dragons said saphira do not require possessions to be happy
what use have we for riches when our hides are more glorious than any treasure hoard in existence no i am content with the kindness that you have shown eragon
