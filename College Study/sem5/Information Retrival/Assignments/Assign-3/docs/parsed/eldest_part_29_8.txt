i must apologize for blagden is wretched verses said islanzadi
he has ever had a saucy tongue despite our attempts to tame it
apology accepted said saphira calmly and returned to her pie
where does he come from eragon asked eager to return to more cordial footing with arya but also genuinely curious
blagden said arya once saved my father is life
evandar was fighting an urgal when he stumbled and lost his sword
before the urgal could strike a raven flew at him and pecked out his eyes
no one knows why the bird did it but the distraction allowed evandar to regain his balance and so win the battle
my father was always generous so he thanked the raven by blessing him with spells for intelligence and long life
however the magic had two effects that he did not foresee blagden lost all color in his feathers and he gained the ability to predict certain events
he can see into the future asked eragon startled
see no
but perhaps he can sense what is to come
in any case he always speaks in riddles most of which are a fair bit of nonsense
just remember that if blagden ever comes to you and tells you something that is not a joke or a pun you would do well to heed his words
once the meal had concluded islanzadi stood causing a flurry of activity as everyone hastened to do likewise and said it is late i am tired and i would return to my bower
accompany me saphira and eragon and i will show you where you may sleep ** the queen motioned with one hand to arya then left the table
arya followed
as eragon stepped around the table with saphira he paused by the woman child caught by her feral eyes
all the elements of her appearance from her eyes to her shaggy hair to her white fangs triggered eragon is memory
you re a werecat are not you she blinked once and then bared her teeth in a dangerous smile
i met one of your kin solembum in teirm and in farthen dur
her grin widened
aye
a good one he is
humans bore me buthe finds it amusing to travel with the witch ** then her gaze switched to saphira and she uttered a throaty half growl half purr of appreciation
names be powerful things in the heart of du weldenvarden dragon yes they are
however
among the elves i am known as the watcher and as quickpaw and as the dream dancer but you may know me as ** she tossed her mane of stiff white bangs
you d better catch up with the queen younglings she does not take lightly to fools or laggards
it was a pleasure meeting you maud said eragon
he bowed and saphira inclined her head
eragon glanced at orik wondering where the dwarf would be taken and then pursued islanzadi
they overtook the queen just as she reached the base of a tree
the trunk was ridged by a delicate staircase that spiraled up to a series of globular rooms cupped and suspended in the tree is crown by a spray of branches
islanzadi lifted an elegant hand and pointed at the eyrie
you needs must fly there saphira
our stairs were not grown with dragons in ** then she spoke to eragon this is where the leader of the dragon riders would dwell while in ellesmera
i give it to you now for you are the rightful heir to that title
it is your ** before eragon could thank her the queen swept past and departed with arya who held his gaze for a long moment before vanishing deeper into the city
shall we see what accommodations they ve provided us with asked saphira
she jumped into the air and sailed around the tree in a tight circle balancing on one wing tip perpendicular to the ground
as eragon took the first step he saw that islanzadi had spoken true the stairs were one with the tree
the bark beneath his feet was smooth and flat from the many elves who had traversed it but it was still part of the trunk as were the twisting cobweb banisters by his side and the curved railing that slid under his right hand
because the stairs had been designed with the elves strength in mind they were steeper than eragon was used to and his calves and thighs soon began to burn
he was breathing so hard when he reached the top after climbing through a trapdoor in the floor of one of the rooms he had to put his hands on his knees and bend over to pant
