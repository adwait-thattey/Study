then the high priest issued a brief order
twin blades of steel winked like stars as they rose and fell
a rivulet of blood sprang from each of the high priest is shoulders flowed down the leather encased torso and then pooled across the boulder until it overflowed onto the gravel below
two more priests jumped forward to catch the crimson flow in goblets that when filled to the rim were distributed among the members of the congregation who eagerly drank
** said roran in an undertone
you failed to mention that those errant flesh mongers those gore bellied boggle minded idiotworshipers were cannibals
not quite
they do not partake of the meat
when all the attendees had wet their throats the servile novitiates returned the high priest to the litter and bound the creature is shoulders with strips of white linen
wet blotches quickly sullied the virgin cloth
the wounds seemed to have no effect upon the high priest for the limbless figure rotated back toward the devotees with their lips of cranberry red and pronounced now are you truly my brothers and sisters having tasted the sap of my veins here in the shadow of almighty helgrind
blood calls to blood and if ever your family should need help do then what you can for the church and for others who acknowledge the power of our dread lord
to affirm and reaffirm our fealty to the triumvirate recite with me the nine oaths
by gorm ilda and fell angvara we vow to perform homage at least thrice a month in the hour before dusk and then to make an offering of ourselves to appease the eternal hunger of our great and terrible lord
we vow to observe the strictures as they are presented in the book of tosk
we vow to always carry our bregnir on our bodies and to forever abstain from the twelve of twelves and the touch of a many knotted rope lest it corrupt
a sudden rise in the wind obscured the rest of the high priest is list
then eragon saw those who listened take out a small curved knife and one by one cut themselves in the crook of their elbows and anoint the altar with a stream of their blood
some minutes later the angry breeze subsided and eragon again heard the priest
and such things as you long and lust for will be granted to you as a reward for your obedience
our worship is complete
however if any now stand among you who are brave enough to demonstrate the true depth of their faith let them show **
the audience stiffened and leaned forward their faces rapt this apparently was what they had been waiting for
for a long silent pause it seemed as if they would be disappointed but then one of the acolytes broke ranks and shouted i ** with a roar of delight his brethren began to brandish their bells in a quick and savage beat whipping the congregation into such a frenzy they jumped and yelled as if they had taken leave of their senses
the rough music kindled a spark of excitement in eragon is heart despite his revulsion at the proceedings waking some primal and brutish part of him
shedding his gold robes so that he wore nothing but a leather breechcloth the dark haired youth sprang on top of the altar
gouts of ruby spray erupted on either side of his feet
he faced helgrind and began to shiver and quake as if stricken with palsy keeping time with the tolling of the cruel iron bells
his head rolled loosely upon his neck foam gathered at the corners of his mouth his arms thrashed like snakes
sweat oiled his muscles until he gleamed like a bronze statue in the dying light
the bells soon reached a manic tempo where one note clashed against another at which point the young man thrust a hand out behind himself
into it a priest deposited the hilt of a bizarre implement a single edged weapon two and a half feet long with a full tang scale grips a vestigial crossguard and a broad flat blade that widened and was scalloped near the end a shape reminiscent of a dragon wing
it was a tool designed for but one purpose to hack through armor and bones and sinew as easily as through a bulging waterskin
the young man lifted the weapon so that it slanted toward the highest peak of helgrind
