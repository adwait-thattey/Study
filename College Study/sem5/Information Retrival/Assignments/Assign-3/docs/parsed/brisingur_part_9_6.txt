desperate she concentrated upon her desire to preserve the varden and overthrow galbatorix the two causes to which she had devoted her entire being
in her mind she saw her father and jormundur and eragon an
the people of the varden and she thought for ** i do this for them
i was born to serve and this is my service
a moment later fadawar opened up a third gash on his forearm as did nasuada on her own
the fourth cut followed soon thereafter
and the fifth
a strange lethargy overtook nasuada
she was so very tired and cold as well
it occurred to her then that tolerance of pain might not decide the trial but rather who would faint first from loss of blood
shifting streams of it ran across her wrist and down her fingers splashing into the thick pool by her feet
a similar if larger puddle gathered around fadawar is boots
the row of gaping red slits on the warlord is arm reminded nasuada of the gills of a fish a thought that for some reason seemed incredibly funny to her she had to bite her tongue to keep from giggling
with a howl fadawar succeeded in completing his sixth cut
best that you feckless ** he shouted over the noise of the drums and dropped to one knee
fadawar trembled as he transferred his knife from his right hand to his left tradition dictated a maximum of six cuts per arm else you risked severing the veins and tendons close to the wrist
as nasuada imitated his movement king orrin sprang between them and said ** i wo not allow this to continue
you re going to kill yourselves
he reached toward nasuada then jumped back as she stabbed at him
do not meddle she growled between her teeth
now fadawar started on his right forearm releasing a spray of blood from his rigid muscles
he is clenching she realized
she hoped the mistake would be enough to break him
nasuada could not help herself she uttered a wordless cry when the knife parted her skin
the razor edge burned like a white hot wire
halfway through the cut her traumatized left arm twitched
the knife swerved as a result leaving her with a long jagged laceration twice as deep as the others
her breath stopped while she weathered the agony
i can not go on she thought
i can not
i can not
it is too much to bear
i d rather die
oh please let it ** it gave her some relief to indulge in those and other desperate complaints but in the depths of her heart she knew she would never give up
for the eighth time fadawar positioned his blade above one of his forearms and there he held it the pale metal suspended a quarter of an inch away from his sable skin
he remained thus as sweat dripped over his eyes and his wounds shed ruby tears
it appeared as though his courage might have failed him but then he snarled and with a quick yank sliced his arm
his hesitation bolstered nasuada is flagging strength
a fierce exhilaration overtook her transmuting her pain into an almost pleasurable sensation
she matched fadawar is effort and then spurred onward by her sudden heedless disregard for her own well being brought the knife down again
the prospect of having to make two cuts in a row one to equal the number of nasuada is and one to advance the contest seemed to intimidate fadawar
he blinked licked his lips and adjusted his grip on his knife three times before he raised the weapon over his arm
his tongue darted out and moistened his lips again
a spasm distorted his left hand and the knife dropped from his contorted fingers burying itself upright in the ground
he picked it up
underneath his robe his chest rose and fell with frantic speed
lifting the knife he touched it to his arm it promptly drew a small trickle of blood
fadawar is jaw knotted and writhed and then a shudder ran the length of his spine and he doubled over pressing his injured arms against his belly
i submit he said
the ensuing silence lasted for only an instant before king orrin jormundur and everyone else filled the pavilion with their overlapping exclamations
nasuada paid no attention to their remarks
groping behind herself she found her chair and sank into it eager to take the weight off her legs before they gave way beneath her
