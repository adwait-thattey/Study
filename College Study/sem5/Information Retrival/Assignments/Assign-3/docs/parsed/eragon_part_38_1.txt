avast expanse of dunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean
bursts of wind twirled the reddish gold sand into the air
scraggly trees grew on scattered patches of solid ground ground any farmer would have declared unfit for crops
rising in the distance was a line of purple crags
the imposing desolation was barren of any animals except for a bird gliding on the zephyrs
you re sure we will find food for the horses out there queried eragon slurring his words
the hot dry air stung his throat
see those asked murtagh indicating the crags
grass grows around them
it is short and tough but the horses will find it sufficient
i hope you re right said eragon squinting at the sun
before we continue let is rest
my mind is slow as a snail and i can barely move my legs
they untied the elf from saphira ate then lay in the shadow of a dune for a nap
as eragon settled into the sand saphira coiled up next to him and spread her wings over ** is a wondrous place she ** could spend years here and not notice the passing time
eragon closed his ** would be a nice place to fly he agreed drowsily
not only that i feel as though i was made for this desert
it has the space i need mountains where i could roost and camouflaged prey that i could spend days hunting
and the ** cold does not disturb me but this heat makes me feel alive and full of ** craned her head toward the sky stretching happily
you like it that much mumbled eragon
then when this is all done perhaps we can return
he drifted into slumber even as he spoke
saphira was pleased and hummed gently while he and murtagh rested
it was the morning of the fourth day since leaving gil ead
they had already covered thirty five leagues
they slept just long enough to clear their minds and rest the horses
no soldiers could be seen to the rear but that did not lull them into slowing their pace
they knew that the empire would keep searching until they were far beyond the king is reach
eragon said couriers must have carried news of my escape to galbatorix
he would have alerted the ra zac
they re sure to be on our trail by now
it will take them a while to catch us even by flying but we should be ready for them at all times
and this time they will find i am not so easily bound with chains said saphira
murtagh scratched his chin
i hope they wo not be able to follow us past bullridge
the ramr was an effective way to lose pursuers there is a good chance our tracks wo not be found again
something to hope for indeed said eragon as he checked the elf
her condition was unchanged she still did not react to his ministrations
i place no faith in luck right now though
the ra zac could be on our trail even as we speak
at sunset they arrived at the crags they had viewed from afar that morning
the imposing stone bluffs towered over them casting thin shadows
the surrounding area was free of dunes for a half mile
heat assailed eragon like a physical blow as he dismounted snowfire onto the baked cracked ground
the back of his neck and his face were sunburned his skin was hot and feverish
after picketing the horses where they could nibble the sparse grass murtagh started a small fire
how far do you think we went eragon asked releasing the elf from saphira
i do not ** snapped murtagh
his skin was red his eyes bloodshot
he picked up a pot and muttered a curse
we do not have enough water
and the horses have to drink
eragon was just as irritated by the heat and dryness but he held his temper in check
bring the ** saphira dug a hole for him with her claws then he closed his eyes releasing the spell
though the ground was parched there was enough moisture for the plants to live on and enough for him to fill the hole several times over
murtagh refilled the waterskins as water pooled in the hole then stood aside and let the horses drink
the thirsty animals quaffed gallons
eragon was forced to draw the liquid from ever deeper in the earth to satisfy their desire
it taxed his strength to the limit
when the horses were finally sated he said to saphira if you need a drink take it now
her head snaked around him and she took two long draughts but no more
