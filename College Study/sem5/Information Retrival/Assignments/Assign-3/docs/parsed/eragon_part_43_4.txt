the pool was mildly salty but soothing and calm
for a moment he was afraid of drifting away from the door into deeper water but as he waded forward he discovered the water reached only to his waist
he groped over a slippery wall until he found the soap and brushes then scrubbed himself
afterward he floated with his eyes closed enjoying the warmth
when he emerged dripping into the lighted room he found a towel a fine linen shirt and a pair of breeches
the clothes fit him reasonably well
satisfied he went out into the tunnel
orik was waiting for him pipe in hand
they climbed the stairs back up into tronjheim then exited the city mountain
eragon gazed at tronjheim is peak and called saphira with his mind
as she flew down from the dragonhold he asked how do you communicate with people at the top of tronjheim
orik chuckled
that is a problem we solved long ago
you did not notice but behind the open arches that line each level is a single unbroken staircase that spirals around the wall of tronjheim is central chamber
the stairs climb all the way to the dragonhold above isidar mithrim
we call it vol turin the endless staircase
running up or down it is not swift enough for an emergency nor convenient enough for casual use
instead we use flashing lanterns to convey messages
there is another way too though it is seldom used
when vol turin was constructed a polished trough was cut next to it
the trough acts as a giant slide as high as a mountain
eragon is lips twitched with a smile
is it dangerous
do not think of trying it
the slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man
if you slipped out of it you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches perhaps even into empty space
saphira landed a spear is throw away her scales rustling dryly
as she greeted eragon humans and dwarves trickled out of tronjheim gathering around her with murmurs of interest
eragon regarded the growing crowd uneasily
you d better go said orik pushing him forward
meet me by this gate tomorrow morning
i will be waiting
eragon balked
how will i know when it is morning
i will have someone wake you
now ** without further protest eragon slipped through the jostling group that surrounded saphira and jumped onto her back
before she could take off an old woman stepped forward and grasped eragon is foot with a fierce grip
he tried to pull away but her hand was like an iron talon around his ankle he could not break her tenacious hold
the burning gray eyes she fixed on him were surrounded by a lifetime is worth of wrinkles the skin was folded in long creases down her sunken cheeks
a tattered bundle rested in the crook of her left arm
frightened eragon asked what do you want
the woman tilted her arm and a cloth fell from the bundle revealing a baby is face
hoarse and desperate she said the child has no parents there is no one to care for her but me and i am weak
bless her with your power argetlam
bless her for **
eragon looked to orik for help but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression
the small crowd fell silent waiting for his response
the woman is eyes were still fastened on him
bless her argetlam bless her she insisted
eragon had never blessed anyone
it was not something done lightly in alagaesia as a blessing could easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boon especially if it was spoken with ill intent or lack of ** i dare take that responsibility he wondered
suddenly decided he searched for a phrase or expression to use
nothing came to mind until inspired he thought of the ancient language
this would be a true blessing spoken with words of power by one of power
he bent down and tugged the glove off his right hand
laying his palm on the babe is brow he intoned atra gulai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waise skolir fra ** the words left him unexpectedly weak as if he had used magic
he slowly pulled the glove back on and said to the woman that is all i can do for her
if any words have the power to forestall tragedy it will be those
thank you argetlam she whispered bowing slightly
she started to cover the baby again but saphira snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child
