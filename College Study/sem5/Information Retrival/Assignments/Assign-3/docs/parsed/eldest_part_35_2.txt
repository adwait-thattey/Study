the werecat maud crouched beside him in the shadows watching his progress
her eyes flared silver as she looked at eragon and saphira
the elf followed her gaze and nodded to them without halting his work
through the trees eragon glimpsed an elf man or woman he could not tell squatting on a rock in the middle of a stream muttering a spell over the orb of glass clutched in its hands
he twisted his neck in an attempt to get an unobstructed view but the spectacle had already vanished into the dark
what asked eragon keeping his voice low so as to not disturb anyone do most elves do for a living or profession
arya answered just as quietly
our strength with magic grants us as much leisure as we desire
we neither hunt nor farm and as a result we spend our days working to master our interests whatever they might be
very little exists that we must strive for
through a tunnel of dogwood draped with creepers they entered the enclosed atrium of a house grown out of a ring of trees
an open walled hut occupied the center of the atrium which sheltered a forge and an assortment of tools that eragon knew even horst would covet
an elf woman held a pair of small tongs in a nest of molten coals working bellows with her right hand
with uncanny speed she pulled the tongs from the fire revealing a ring of white hot steel clamped in the pincers jaws looped the ring through the edge of an incomplete mail corselet hung over the anvil grasped a hammer and welded shut the open ends of the ring with a blow and a burst of sparks
only then did arya approach
atra esterni ono thelduin
the elf faced them her neck and cheek lit from underneath by the coals bloody light
like taut wires embedded in her skin her face was scribed with a delicate pattern of lines the greatest display of age eragon had seen in an elf
she gave no response to arya which he knew was offensive and discourteous especially since the queen is daughter had honored her by speaking first
rhunon elda i have brought you the newest rider eragon shadeslayer
i heard you were dead said rhunon to arya
rhunon is voice guttered and rasped unlike any other elf is
it reminded eragon of the old men of carvahall who sat on the porches outside their houses smoking pipes and telling stories
arya smiled
when did you last leave your house rhunon
you should know
it was that midsummer is feast you forced me to attend
was it rhunon frowned as she banked the coals and covered them with a grated lid
well what of it i find company trying
a gaggle of meaningless chatter that
she glared at arya
why are we speaking this foul language i suppose you want me to forge a sword for him you know i swore to never create instruments of death again not after that traitor of a rider and the destruction he wreaked with my blade
eragon already has a sword said arya
she raised her arm and presented zar roc to the smith
rhunon took zar roc with a look of wonder
she caressed the wine red sheath lingered on the black symbol etched into it rubbed a bit of dirt from the hilt then wrapped her fingers around the handle and drew the sword with all the authority of a warrior
she sighted down each of zar roc is edges and flexed the blade between her hands until eragon feared it might break
then in a single movement rhunon swung zar roc over her head and brought it down upon the tongs on her anvil riving them in half with a resounding ring
zar roc said rhunon
i remember ** she cradled the weapon like a mother would her firstborn
as perfect as the day you were ** turning her back she looked up at the knotted branches while she traced the curves of the pommel
my entire life i spent hammering these swords out of ore
thenhe came and destroyed them
centuries of effort obliterated in an instant
so far as i knew only four examples of my art still ** sword oromis is and two others guarded by families who managed to rescue them from the wyrdfell
wyrdfell eragon dared ask arya with his mind
rhunon turned on eragon
now zar roc has returned to me
of all my creations this i least expected to hold again save forhis
