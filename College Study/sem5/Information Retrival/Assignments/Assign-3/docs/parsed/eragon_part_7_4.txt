because he glanced at the man wondering if he would explode like sloan i found this in the spine and folks around here do not like that
merlock gave him a startled look
do you know why my fellow merchants and i were late this year
our wanderings have been dogged with misfortune
chaos seems to rule alagaesia
we could not avoid illness attacks and the most cursed black luck
because the varden is attacks have increased galbatorix has forced cities to send more soldiers to the borders men who are needed to combat the urgals
the brutes have been migrating southeast toward the hadarac desert
no one knows why and it would not concern us except that they re passing through populated areas
they ve been spotted on roads and near cities
worst of all are reports of a shade though the stories are unconfirmed
not many people survive such an encounter
why have not we heard of this cried eragon
because said merlock grimly it only began a few months ago
whole villages have been forced to move because urgals destroyed their fields and starvation threatens
nonsense growled garrow
we have not seen any urgals the only one around here has his horns mounted in morn is tavern
merlock arched an eyebrow
maybe so but this is a small village hidden by mountains
it is not surprising that you ve escaped notice
however i would not expect that to last
i only mentioned this because strange things are happening here as well if you found such a stone in the ** with that sobering statement he bid them farewell with a bow and slight smile
garrow headed back to carvahall with eragon trailing behind
what do you think asked eragon
i am going to get more information before i make up my mind
take the stone back to the wagon then do what you want
i will meet you for dinner at horst is
eragon dodged through the crowd and happily dashed back to the wagon
trading would take his uncle hours time that he planned to enjoy fully
he hid the stone under the bags then set out into town with a cocky stride
he walked from one booth to another evaluating the goods with a buyer is eye despite his meager supply of coins
when he talked with the merchants they confirmed what merlock had said about the instability in alagaesia
over and over the message was repeated last year is security has deserted us new dangers have appeared and nothing is safe
later in the day he bought three sticks of malt candy and a small piping hot cherry pie
the hot food felt good after hours of standing in the snow
he licked the sticky syrup from his fingers regretfully wishing for more then sat on the edge of a porch and nibbled a piece of candy
two boys from carvahall wrestled nearby but he felt no inclination to join them
as the day descended into late afternoon the traders took their business into people is homes
eragon was impatient for evening when the troubadours would come out to tell stories and perform tricks
he loved hearing about magic gods and if they were especially lucky the dragon riders
carvahall had its own storyteller brom a friend of eragon is but his tales grew old over the years whereas the troubadours always had new ones that he listened to eagerly
eragon had just broken off an icicle from the underside of the porch when he spotted sloan nearby
the butcher had not seen him so eragon ducked his head and bolted around a corner toward morn is tavern
the inside was hot and filled with greasy smoke from sputtering tallow candles
the shiny black urgal horns their twisted span as great as his outstretched arms were mounted over the door
the bar was long and low with a stack of staves on one end for customers to carve
morn tended the bar his sleeves rolled up to his elbows
the bottom half of his face was short and mashed as if he had rested his chin on a grinding wheel
people crowded solid oak tables and listened to two traders who had finished their business early and had come in for beer
morn looked up from a mug he was cleaning
** good to see you
where is your uncle
buying said eragon with a shrug
he is going to be a while
and roran is he here asked morn as he swiped the cloth through another mug
