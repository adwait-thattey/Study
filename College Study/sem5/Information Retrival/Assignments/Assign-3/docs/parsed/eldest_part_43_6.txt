when she was with him saphira insisted that he ride upon her back and did everything that she could to make him comfortable and to save him effort
one morning as he clung to a spike on her neck eragon said i have a new name for pain
the obliterator
because when you re in pain nothing else can exist
not thought
not emotion
only the drive to escape the pain
when it is strong enough the obliterator strips us of everything that makes us who we are until we re reduced to creatures less than animals creatures with a single desire and goal escape
i am falling apart saphira like an old horse that is plowed too many fields
keep hold of me with your mind or i may drift apart and forget who i am
i will never let go of you
soon afterward eragon fell victim to three bouts of agony while fighting vanir and then two more during the rimgar
as he uncurled from the clenched ball he had rolled into oromis said again eragon
you must perfect your balance
eragon shook his head and growled in an undertone ** he crossed his arms to hide his tremors
get up eragon and try again
** do the pose yourself i wo not
oromis knelt beside eragon and placed a cool hand on his cheek
holding it there he gazed at eragon with such kindness eragon understood the depth of the elf is compassion for him and that if it were possible oromis would willingly assume eragon is pain to relieve his suffering
do not abandon hope said oromis
never ** a measure of strength seemed to flow from him to eragon
we are the riders
we stand between the light and the dark and keep the balance between the two
ignorance fear hate these are our enemies
deny them with all your might eragon or we will surely ** he stood and extended a hand toward eragon
now rise shadeslayer and prove you can conquer the instincts of your **
eragon took a deep breath and pushed himself upright on one arm wincing from the effort
he got his feet underneath himself paused for a moment then straightened to his full height and looked oromis in the eye
eragon remained silent until they finished the rimgar and went to bathe in the stream whereupon he said master
why must i endure this torture you could use magic to give me the skills i need to shape my body as you do the trees and plants
i could but if i did you would not understand how you got the body you had your own abilities nor how to maintain them
no shortcuts exist for the path you walk eragon
cold water rushed over the length of eragon is body as he lowered himself into the stream
he ducked his head under the surface holding a rock so that he would not float away and lay stretched out along the streambed feeling like an arrow flying through the water
