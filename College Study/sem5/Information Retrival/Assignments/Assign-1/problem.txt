Take a set of documents.
Minimum 10 documents , each document containing at least 20 words.

Then there are 5 components:
1. Create an index for all words in the documents. The posting list will contain the documents in which the word occurs.

2. Search for a query using the above created index.
     For example the query can be "word1 AND word2"
     We need to get the list of documents that contain both word1 and word2
     We need to answer queries for AND OR NOT operations

3. Make a permuterm index for all the words. 
     See the above video for info on permuterm index.
     For this, sir did not specify which data structure to use for permuterm index. Make assumptions. 
     I will also clarify with sir tomorrow if he is available.

4. Give list of all words matching a  wild card query using the permuterm index.
     For example the query can be X* , X*Y , *X
     Again, refer to the class slides or the above video for more info on this.

5. Answer boolean wildcard queries using permuterm index
     Similar to 3rd problem. This time containing wild cards.
      Example: "ab* AND x*y"
