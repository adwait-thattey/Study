  "question": "I know that we can use the containsAll method while comparing two ArrayLists to check if one is a subset of the other. But this is what I would like. Consider an \nArrayList super = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \nand an \nArrayList sub1 = 1,2,3,4 \nand another \nArrayList sub2 = 2,4,6,8. \nNow, if I did \nsuper.containsAll(sub1), it would evaluate to true because sub1 is contained within super. \nIf I did super.containsAll(sub2), it would also evaluate to true because the numbers 2,4,6 and 8 are contained in super. \nI would like to know if there's a way to check two ArrayLists so that super.containsAll(sub2) evaluates to false as the numbers in sub2 don't appear in the same order in super."
