Ted is busy working on the computer system for a company. One day he got bored of doing repetitive task given to him by his boss. He decided to write a program to automate this task so that it takes minimum time to write using the editor. It takes A seconds to insert or delete a letter 'C' from the editor and B seconds to copy string and make a duplicate of it. Help Ted in minimising his time of making a string containing N characters.

Note: Assume all characters in string are equal to 'C'.

Test 1: "" -> "C" -> "CC" -> "CCCC" -> "CCCCCCCC". 
It can be seen that time taken at each stage is 1 second, so the total (and minimum) time taken will be 4 seconds.
