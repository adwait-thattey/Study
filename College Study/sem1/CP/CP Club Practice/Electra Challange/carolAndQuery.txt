Carol was preparing for his regional programming contest when he came across a rather difficult question.

The question stated that:

Given an array A[] of n integers and q queries of form "l x", your job is to answer the following:

Find the minimum r for which the minimum element in the range l..r(l and r inclusive) in the array is lesser than x

Help Carol in solving the problem.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers integer n and q - the size of array A and the number of queries

The following line contains n integers - the values of array A.

The following q lines contain n queries of the form l x

Constraints

Subtask 1: n <= 1000 q <= 1000

Subtask 2: n <= 100000 q <= 100000

Output Format

For every query print the required value of r

If no such r exists print -1
