Ram encountered an intriguing problem while practising for ACM ICPC.

The problem states that you are given two numbers and you should calculate the 9's complement of their difference. Since Ram is just a beginner he is asking you to help him in solving this question.

Note: In case of 9's complement, leading zeroes should not be omitted and it's number of digits should be equal to the no. of digits of the difference of (a-b)

Input Format

First line of the input contains T, number of testcases.

Each test case contains two lines.

First line of the test case contains integer A.

Second line of the test case contains integer B.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= number of digits in A = number of digits in B <= 10^6

A >= B

Output Format

Print T lines each containing 9's complement of A-B.
