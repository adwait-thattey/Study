Question 14

Question 15
	Ans:  (a) cat big.file
				This will display the contents of the file : big.file which contains 
				the detailed list of all files present in /bin
				
		  (b) more big.file
				This will also display the content of file but will spilit it into 
				parts so that we can navigate and read the whole content smoothly
				
		  (c) The difference between cat and more is that while cat displays all
				the content in one go, more spilits all the content into small parts 
				such that 1 part fits on our terminal screen. We can then go to the next 
				part by pressing the space key or go to the next line by pressing the Enter key
				
				It is better to use more when we wish to inspect the contents of file line by line.
		  
		  (d) The file contained 2 lines with the string "bash"
				
				The command used is:
				
					cat big.file | grep bash

				cd ITWS1
				mkdir dir_practice

				files and folders inside the home directory. It will subsequently also
				list all the files and folders present inside every directory inside home. This

				whether directly or indirectly have been listed.

				(Press Control + D after this to save the content and close the file
				
			
		  (f)   mv stuff/filea stuff/filex
				mv -i stuff/morestuff/fileb stuff/morestuff/stillmore/filec
				mv: overwrite 'stuff/morestuff/stillmore/filec'? n
