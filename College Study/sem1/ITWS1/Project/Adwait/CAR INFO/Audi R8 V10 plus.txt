
BORN ON THE TRACK. BUILT FOR THE ROAD.


SPECS

Created in the world’s toughest development lab: the world of motorsport. We drew on our experiences with motorsport for the development of the Audi R8. For example, the many national and international GT3 titles won by the R8 LMS, including victories at the classic 24-hour races in the Nürburgring, Spa, and Daytona.** This means that the Audi R8 Coupé V10 plus* is rooted in the tradition of GT3 racing – and you can feel it the instant you turn on the engine.
